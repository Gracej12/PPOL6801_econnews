workers wages have been rising faster than prices for more than a year now Their nations economy meanwhile is the envy of the wealthy world Since the Covid recession the United States has seen nearly twice as much growth as any other major rich country without suffering significantly higher inflation And economic analysts expect that America will continue to grow at double the rate of its peers for the rest of This growth will enhance an already robust economy The nations unemployment rate has sat below percent for more than two years now the longest such streak since the s With labor markets persistently tight lowincome workers have finally secured some leverage over their employers and wage inequality has fallen as a result Nevertheless US voters give their nations economy poor marks in surveys In the latest polling from Civiqs percent of respondents rate the national economy as fairly bad or very bad with percent choosing the latter description Other polls indicate that this widespread pessimism is preventing the public from ascertaining basic economic facts For example percent of swingstate voters in a recent Wall Street Journal poll said that inflation had moved in the wrong direction over the past year a statement that is straightforwardly untrue Liberal pundits are generally keen to correct popular misperceptions of economic statistics and they are ideologically invested in Joe Bidens reelection For these reasons many have spent the past few months touting the economys objective virtues and bemoaning the publics misguided discontent Such commentary can make liberals sound complacent about the American peoples myriad economic challenges And yet although commentators should not ignore those difficulties they also shouldnt exaggerate them Affirming the working classs misperceptions of the Biden economy does it no favors To the contrary validating the publics economic pessimism risks shifting American macroeconomic policy in an antilabor direction But this hazard is lost on many in the commentariat In recent months several pundits and influencers have sought to portray the contemporary economys champions as cosseted elites whove lost touch with reality And their argument boasts superficial plausibility After all the Paul Krugmans of this world enjoy an exalted place in Americas socioeconomic hierarchy The Democratic economists who sing the Biden economys praises in prestigious publications are generally much wealthier than the voters who lament runaway inflation in opinion polls And sometimes the former really do gloss over the more unfortunate aspects of Bidens economic record If you zero in on these omissions the posture of these Democratic economists can appear unseemly Where do these rich liberals find the nerve to tell workingclass Americans that they should stop worrying about rising food prices and start loving the Biden economy Countless selfstyled populists have made versions of this argument in recent months This X post from the author Carol Roth is a crude but not atypical example Paul Krugman doesnt know any regular Americans and so he and the rest of the corporate press mock and gaslight you while you struggle with your rent or mortgage food and other living costs Absolutely zero compassion or connection to reality And yet although this brand of commentary is populist in affect it may be contrary to workers best interests in practice The signature strengths and weaknesses of the Biden economy its low unemployment and elevated prices are byproducts of one fundamental policy decision Faced with the Covid recession the US government chose to prioritize poverty reduction and full employment over minimizing the risk of inflation Put differently instead of forcing the nations most vulnerable workers to pay the inescapable economic costs of the pandemic through prolonged periods of material deprivation and joblessness we spread those costs across the entire population through a temporary period of high inflation This is not how the US government has traditionally responded to recessions And it is an approach to macroeconomic policy that simultaneously centers the interests of the working class and promotes economic growth Yet it is also politically vulnerable due to widespread misconceptions about how the economy works If those misconceptions lead the electorate to punish lawmakers for prioritizing full employment then macroeconomic policy will likely shift rightward in the future and the next recession will take a needlessly large toll on Americas most vulnerable What critics of the Biden economy get right To appreciate the pitfalls of antiinflation populism we need to first grapple with the strongest arguments for that outlook The Atlantics Michael Powell helpfully assembles these in his most recent column titled What the UpperMiddleClass Left Doesnt Get About Inflation Powell argues that liberal commentators enthusiasm for the Biden economy betrays their class privilege The modern Democratic Party and liberalism itself Powell writes is to a substantial extent a bastion of collegeeducated uppermiddleclass professionals people for whom Bidenera inflation is unpleasant but rarely calamitous But poor workingclass and lowermiddleclass Americans arent so insulated from the harms of rising prices Telling them that the economy is actually strong is both incorrect in Powells view and politically counterproductive In making this case Powell makes several strong points First and most compellingly he notes that measures of real wages dont take account of rising borrowing costs Inflation has fallen sharply since but interest rates have risen And since Americans finance many of their purchases through debt higher interest rates dampen the impact of slowing price growth As he notes a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper found that when you account for borrowing costs the publics mood about the economy comes much closer to tracking objective changes in the cost of living Second Powell correctly observes that lowincome Americans are much more vulnerable to sudden increases in the cost of food and energy than are more affluent Americans The inflationary spike of and was indeed deeply bruising for a large swath of the US population Most US workers suffered from declining real wages for nearly all of Bidens first two years in office Things have turned around since then but many workers still have less purchasing power now than they did when Biden was inaugurated And its understandable that others would have lingering resentments Third Powell rightly notes that the American economy remains riven by structural inequalities Many households have never fully recovered from the foreclosure crisis And the nations skimpy welfare state keeps many workers perpetually on the brink of financial crisis Fourth America is suffering from a housing shortage that makes homeownership unaffordable for the middle class and rent burdensome for many workers But none of these points refute the core claims of the socalled uppermiddleclass left namely that national economic conditions are significantly better than most voters recognize and that Americas Covidera macroeconomic policies while imperfect were remarkably successful in mitigating the inescapable economic damages wrought by the pandemic Powell never engages with the second point Rather his piece focuses on portraying the first claim as a delusion of the privileged Yet his argument suffers from a fundamental flaw When analyzing the impact of inflation on Americans finances he repeatedly ignores the inextricable and countervailing impact of wage growth Ironically this exact error likely explains a considerable portion of the publics economic discontent Americans real wages are higher now than they were before the pandemic Early in his column Powell writes that since Americas workingclass has weathered percent inflation and now rising interest rateswhich means theyve lost more than a fifth of their purchasing power This is simply false You cannot measure a trend in workers purchasing power over time by looking exclusively at changes in their costs Since the consumer price index has risen by roughly percent If we applied Powells logic to that data point we would conclude that Americans purchasing power had apocalyptically collapsed since the Truman administration But of course Americans are not poorer today than they were in because since that year the median US household income has increased by roughly percent Similarly although consumer prices have risen percent since the average hourly wage among nonmanagerial workers in the US has grown by percent over the same period Put differently at least for Americans who dont debtfinance their expenditures purchasing power is higher today than it was in Its difficult to say exactly how one should factor interest rate increases into this equation since exposure to elevated borrowing costs varies so widely across the population But its safe to say that even considering the impact of higher rates Americans have not lost anything close to onefifth of their buying power since if theyve lost any at all Were that actually the case inflation would be minimal because consumers would not be able to afford to bid up the prices of goods and services and the economy would likely be in recession Powell does eventually acknowledge that wages have been rising faster than inflation for a while now But he minimizes this fact by suggesting that it is only true if you ignore food and energy prices As an example of liberals outoftouch optimism he links to a report from the Center for American Progress CAP which found that nearly percent of US workers enjoyed higher inflationadjusted earnings in than in In Powells telling the upshot of that report is that median wage growth has nudged ahead of the core inflation rate He then suggests that this is a trivial fact becausecore inflation which is to say a version of the consumerprice index that excludes volatile food and energy prices is a poor gauge of household costs After all Powell notes grocery and gas prices are economic indicators that affect Americans daily lives Yet this whole line of argument is a non sequitur The CAP report that Powell cites includes food and energy prices when calculating real wages It does not argue that wage growth has nudged ahead of the core inflation rate Rather the report shows that wage growth has outpaced inflation full stop When I asked Powell about this discrepancy he told me that he had not intended to link to the CAP report I know from personal experience that adding the wrong hyperlink to a piece is an easy mistake to make yet Powells column does not cite or link to any other example of liberal economists measuring real wages using core inflation It is true that macroeconomists tend to focus on core inflation when analyzing monetary policy But this is merely because food and energy are globally traded commodities the prices of which are influenced by myriad factors that have little to do with consumer demand in the United States such as outbreaks of bird flu or geopolitical conflicts In other words Powell is right that core inflation is a poor gauge of the publics cost burdens But Im not aware of any commentator who has used it for that purpose The economy has real problems but its still stronger than voters realize When you recognize that real wages are higher today than they were in a year when Americans gave their nations economy historically high marks it becomes clear that Powells strongest arguments dont add up to a rebuttal of the Biden economys boosters Yes lowincome Americans have suffered the most from inflation But they also benefited the most from the ultratight labor market of the early Biden presidency Between and real wages grew by percent for those at the very bottom of Americas income ladder Yes rising rents and home prices constitute a national crisis But even taking housing into account life has been getting more affordable for Americans over the past year as their real incomes have risen And in any event the primary target of Powells critique the New York Timess Paul Krugman is well aware of the housing crisis and has called for policymakers to relax restrictions on apartment construction in order to address it Yes the US economy is profoundly unequal and unjust But this was also the case in when wage inequality was even higher than it is now and Americans strongly approved of the economy five years ago So the existence of such inequities cannot by themselves explain the publics mood Finally it is absolutely true that measures of real wages do not account for changes in borrowing costs This is a significant limitation And Powell is totally right that many liberal commentators have given it short shrift But even the National Bureau of Economic Research paper that he cites notes that fully incorporating borrowing costs into the consumer price index still doesnt fully explain the gap between objective economic conditions and consumer sentiment More basically If borrowing costs were completely nullifying the impact of real wage increases and Americans purchasing power was actually falling then we would not expect to see US consumers increasing their spending Yet retail sales rose sharply during the first quarter of this year Notably if Americans spending habits suggest that they are doing reasonably well financially their survey responses often indicate the same In recent polls of Michigan and Pennsylvania voters roughly percent said their personal finances were in good or excellent shape even as a similar percentage declared the national economy bad or not so good In the wake of the Covid crisis inflation was the price of a proworker macroeconomic policy Economic commentators have no obligation to abet Joe Bidens reelection But they do have a responsibility not to exaggerate the contemporary economys weaknesses And this is especially true if they wish their commentary to advance the interests of working people The past four years witnessed a historic experiment in fiscal policy Traditionally recessions have brought increases in poverty and prolonged periods of elevated unemployment But during the Covid downturn poverty in the United States actually declined After the Great Recession of the late s it took more than nine years for Americas unemployment rate to return to its precrisis level After the Covid downturn it took just over two years These triumphs of economic management and the elevated prices of the past three years are inextricably linked The pandemic simultaneously reduced the economys productive capacity and induced a sudden shift in consumer preferences All across the wealthy world socially distanced households shifted their disposable income away from inperson services and toward manufactured goods Even in the absence of a public health emergency the global economy would have struggled to accommodate this abrupt change in consumer demand Add in pandemicinduced factory closures and a gap inevitably opened up between demand for goods and their supply We could have brought supply and demand into balance by throttling the purchasing power of the most vulnerable workingclass households If you condemn percent of the workforce to unemployment and percent of households to poverty youll alleviate inflationary pressure since fewer people will have the money necessary for bidding up prices Instead we chose to minimize the recessions impact on the vulnerable to a historically unprecedented degree A painful but fleeting period of high inflation proved to be the price of this decision Unfortunately most voters do not recognize the connection between the Biden eras inflation and its low unemployment or strong wage growth A new analysis of survey data by the Harvard economist Stefanie Stantcheva lends credence to an old hypothesis People tend to attribute wage gains to their own efforts or their employers largesse rather than to market dynamics even as they blame price increases on government mismanagement This is a potential problem for progressive macroeconomic policy If voters will punish elected officials for presiding over inflation but wont necessarily give them credit for engineering real wage gains then Congress will have an incentive to err on the side of understimulating the economy during the next recession Powell never explicitly criticizes Bidens fiscal policies The main upshot of his piece is that Democratic politicians should not try to persuade voters that the economy is good but should instead embrace populist rhetoric and deflect blame for high prices onto greedy corporations This is reasonable advice for Biden and Kamala Harris But public intellectuals serve a different function than politicians Trying to make voters appreciate the connection between inflation and wage growth or the fact that the United States has done a superlative job of navigating a worldwide economic crisis may be a quixotic task But it is not an inherently classist or condescending one To the contrary such commentary ultimately aims to help workers make more informed choices at the ballot box so that they can

after two years of elevated inflation and interest rates US consumers remain ready and able to spend Thats the interpretation the countrys biggest banks offered in their firstquarter earnings calls Its good news for the economy From their vantage point the biggest banks can paint a picture of consumers ability to spend how much cash they have on hand how much debt they carry and how likely they are to repay that debt Analysts use that data for clues about where the economy might be headed A weakening consumer would be bad news but big banks dont see that as their base case even if economic growth slows or the labor market weakens Consumers are generally healthy and resilient Morningstar analysts Maoyuan Chen and Dev Patel say Unemployment is very low Home prices are up Stock prices are up higherincome folks still have more money theyre still spending it So whatever happens the customer is in pretty good shape said JPMorgan JPM CEO Jamie Dimon during the banks earnings call last week Spending Rose In the First Quarter Spending rose in the first quarter at the countrys biggest banks including Bank of America BAC JPMorgan Wells Fargo WFC and Citigroup C This is a sign that consumers remain confident about their economic prospects despite headwinds like high interest rates and inflation Spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow year over year Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said on an earnings call last week He added that the bank continues to see strength in the US economy At JPMorgan credit and debit card spending was up year over year in the first quarter At Bank of America credit card spending rose over the fourth quarter but was down on an annual basis At Citigroup credit card spending rose on an annual basis Pandemic Distortions Unwinding In the wake of the covid pandemic strong consumer spending has been a key tailwind for the stock market and the economy Analysts say that dynamic is beginning to shift as pandemicera distortions like excess savings and a rotation away from spending on services fade Still consumers have weathered the storm so far For example consumer debt as a portion of household income is rising but households have handled the extra pressure thanks to a strong jobs market and wages keeping pace with inflation Morningstar analysts point out that the household debt service ratio was in the fourth quarter of Thats higher than the previous two quarters but still quite low they say Household Debt Service Ratio Data as of FRED Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis The analysts add that consumer spending and credit card losses are returning to prepandemic trends signaling the boost from pandemic stimulus and excess savings has largely worked its way out of the economy On the other hand some changes in consumer behavior indicate weakness Morningstar analysts point out that shoppers are shifting spending from discretionary categories like luxury goods

consumers are feeling the squeeze the most This segment of the consumer groups excess money has been used up and now they have a more difficult time meeting interest payments Morningstar analysts wrote They add that credit card delinquencies and chargeoffs for lowincome consumers are returning to their prepandemic levels faster than those for general consumers The extra money of the lower income folks is running out Dimon said Consumers Still Search for Higher Yields One continuing major trend emerged when the Federal Reserve began raising rates deposit migration or cash sorting Consumers are still pulling their cash out of standard checking and savings accounts which pay very little interest and moving it into financial products that pay more interest like certificates of deposit or highyield savings accounts JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum called the shift the dominant trend This momentum was most dramatic in the early days of the ratehiking cycle though the trend has moderated now that rates are likely at their peak You still have some people moving into higheryielding alternatives but the pace of that migration has slowed at least for now said Wells Fargo CFO Michael Santomassimo I think thats indicating that the covid burndown is beginning to run its course Brendan Coughlin head of consumer banking at Citizens Financial Group added in an earnings call Wednesday But with interest rate cuts likely delayed until later this year or further out its a good bet the trend will continue We dont think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above that youre not going to see ongoing migration Barnum said Even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were reintroduced we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yieldseeking behavior Banks are now pressured to pay depositors higher rates putting a dent in their net interest incomea key performance metric describing the difference between the amount they earn on loans and what they pay on deposits When deposit costs are higher banks earn less Risks of a Strong Consumer Banks arent the only ones pointing to consumer strength in the months ahead On balance firms expected consumer spending to increase moderately in the near term a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland concluded in the central banks most recent Beige Book Retail sales in March ran hotter than economists expected rising on a monthly basis compared with FactSets consensus estimate of Februarys print was revised up to Its a sign that consumers are still spending and the economy can continue growing But that growth comes with a downside risk This mornings consumption data continue to tell us not to underestimate this consumer Wells Fargo economists wrote Monday Thats good for growth but could be a problem for the Fed trying to cool inflation This is not the sort of spending associated with falling prices Investors will be watching consumer behavior closely for signs the economy is overheating That could be bad news for a Fed that seems even less likely to cut rates this year than it did just a few weeks ago,Big Banks High Interest Rates and Sticky Inflation Havent Dented Consumer Spending Morningstar Even after two years of elevated inflation and interest rates US consumers remain ready and able to spend Thats the interpretation the countrys biggest banks offered in their firstquarter earnings calls Its good news for the economy From their vantage point the biggest banks can paint a picture of consumers ability to spend how much cash they have on hand how much debt they carry and how likely they are to repay that debt Analysts use that data for clues about where the economy might be headed A weakening consumer would be bad news but big banks dont see that as their base case even if economic growth slows or the labor market weakens Consumers are generally healthy and resilient Morningstar analysts Maoyuan Chen and Dev Patel say Unemployment is very low Home prices are up Stock prices are up higherincome folks still have more money theyre still spending it So whatever happens the customer is in pretty good shape said JPMorgan JPM CEO Jamie Dimon during the banks earnings call last week Spending Rose In the First Quarter Spending rose in the first quarter at the countrys biggest banks including Bank of America BAC JPMorgan Wells Fargo WFC and Citigroup C This is a sign that consumers remain confident about their economic prospects despite headwinds like high interest rates and inflation Spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow year over year Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said on an earnings call last week He added that the bank continues to see strength in the US economy At JPMorgan credit and debit card spending was up year over year in the first quarter At Bank of America credit card spending rose over the fourth quarter but was down on an annual basis At Citigroup credit card spending rose on an annual basis Pandemic Distortions Unwinding In the wake of the covid pandemic strong consumer spending has been a key tailwind for the stock market and the economy Analysts say that dynamic is beginning to shift as pandemicera distortions like excess savings and a rotation away from spending on services fade Still consumers have weathered the storm so far For example consumer debt as a portion of household income is rising but households have handled the extra pressure thanks to a strong jobs market and wages keeping pace with inflation Morningstar analysts point out that the household debt service ratio was in the fourth quarter of Thats higher than the previous two quarters but still quite low they say Household Debt Service Ratio Data as of FRED Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis The analysts add that consumer spending and credit card losses are

again Below well break down three important steps to take See how much more you could earn with a top CD account here now CD moves to make with inflation increasing Here are three CD moves to make with inflation rising again Get started Whether you already have a CD or are just starting out it makes sense to be proactive by taking advantage of todays high rates while you still can If you already have a CD consider laddering it by opening another with a different term and rate This will allow you to earn todays high interest while providing you additional flexibility to access your funds when the initial one matures And if you dont have a CD consider opening one now to earn more on your savings online banks generally offer higher returns than banks with physical locations Whatever path you choose though just avoid keeping your money in a regular account With the average rate on a traditional savings account just today youre losing money and failing to keep pace with inflation by keeping your money there Get started with a CD online today Consider your terms Historically longterm CDs offered higher rates to customers than shortterm ones in exchange for savers locking their money away for an extended period But with the recent rate volatility banks are now taking the opposite approach often offering higher rates on shortterm accounts which expire in months or less than longterm ones So be sure to carefully consider both terms before getting started While the slightly higher rate for a shortterm CD can be best for those simply focused on earning the highest return it may be better to go with a longterm CD which can lock in elevated interest rates for years to come and theyll stay there even if the larger rate climate adjusts downward By considering all options however savers will better be able to determine their preferential path forward Shop around Once youve committed to being proactive and you know which CD tem you want to pursue then get busy shopping around As noted the best rates and terms may come from online banks and lending institutions but you wont know which is truly the best until youve shopped around Similarly you may be able to find an account with no maintenances fees and no early withdrawal penalties which could be a bonus for those unsure about how long they could afford to keep their funds untouched But dont just automatically use the bank you currently have an account with Shop around to find the best deal for your money The bottom line A rise in inflation doesnt have to be a total loss After all increased inflation likely means higher interest rates for longer So take advantage of todays inflationary climate with a CD But be aggressive now to start earning elevated returns as soon as possible

The US Treasury sold trillion in government bonds last year but Treasury auctions recently have seen weak demand suggesting that investors could soon have difficulty absorbing the huge rush of new

debt we could not pay our bills Rubin told Business Insider in an interview Advertisement Debt itself is inherently inflationary meaning consumers can expect higher prices if the government doesnt slow its borrowing Related story Thats because debt provides a measure of stimulus to the economy which speeds up hiring and wage growth If the economy is already at full employment that means higher

a senior economist at EY said Consumers are not feeling great about inflation but what the data is telling you is that even if theyre not feeling great theyre still able to continue to spend That leaves the question Why are we willing to spend through the pain According to experts I talked to the surge in hate spending can be attributed to various factors For one thing a lot of people still have the financial stability necessary to open their wallets On a psychological level many consumers are just throwing up their hands at the state of financial affairs Theyre aware prices arent going back to levels and given everything everyones just been through they may as well live it up Take Jordan Hart a writer in Illinois and selfdescribed cheap bitch She told me that she often finds herself

about this Claire Tassin a retail and ecommerce analyst at Morning Consult told me surveys indicated that the sticker shock of inflation had worn off meaning some of the hate spending comes down to resignation Per Morning Consult the share of people who say theyre paying more for products now than they were a year ago is back to levels even as prices continue to climb Advertisement People have largely just accepted that the prices that are in the market right now are status quo Tassin said Weve acclimated to these inflated prices Theres also a level of YOLO splurging going on among a lot of consumers Theyre buying tickets to see Taylor Swift and booking summer trips to Europe deciding they deserve a treat or several after living through a pandemic People figure Hey if I cant buy a new home right now or upgrade my job or car taking a vacation seems like a decent alternative even if I am paying more than Id like The consumer COVID hangover is lasting longer than many observers expected in a way that opens up the question of whether this youonlyliveonce attitude will last forever If consumers hadnt gone along for the ride on price hikes companies couldnt have undertaken them in the way they did Financial products such as buy now pay later have also made it easier to buy something you cant entirely afford at this very minute I dont know what would force us to hit the breaking point for this degree of consumer spending Tassin said At the same time conspicuous consumption as in buying goods and services to show off a level of status is back on the rise among demographics that are once again jonesing to try new brands and becoming less sensitive to prices While lowerincome consumers are trading down from expensive namebrand products to cheaper alternatives in an effort to save money some younger and higherincome consumers are trading up and shrugging off the higher costs that come with that even if it irks them They want to achieve a higher social status They want to live a life that impresses others and being part of the popular crowd is important Tassin said Part of it is just like This is what it costs now And yes its a lot more expensive than it used to be but its still important to me to keep spending The misalignment between peoples stated attitude toward prices and their actual behavior isnt that outlandish our intentions and emotions often dont match our actions People say they want to eat healthy all the time and then find themselves in the ice cream aisle Its easy to say you want to cut back on spending given high prices but when a friend asks whether you want to go shopping its hard to say no Ravi Dhar a professor of management and marketing and the director of the Center for Customer Insights at Yale School of Management told me theres a sort of decoupling going on between peoples current situations and how they feel about the future They see a headline about people getting laid off or they know theres a global conflict going on so they feel more pessimistic about the economy and worried about costs But when it comes down to actually paying they still have a job and maybe even got a raise so they pony up They have uneasy feelings about the future and how it might change whereas expenditures and spending now is determined by the current state of affairs Dhar said Their predictions have become more pessimistic but not their behavior There is of course a needs vs wants question here Some items are necessities a home to live in food on the table gas in the car childcare healthcare Consumers are understandably frustrated at the costs of these things But in some instances people conflate what is a need whats a reasonable expectation and what sorts of tradeoffs they perhaps should make to achieve their financial goals None of us have to subscribe to six streaming services or escape to a lavish weekend getaway even if we tell ourselves thats what we deserve for stomaching the workday and staring down a grocery bill thats much higher than it used to be Advertisement To the outside that might look like a luxury but to them it says Hey this I need all this for my sanity Dhar said People are averse to loss and having to change their lifestyle to fit newfound financial constraints feels like losing Theres an element of stubbornness here of course that dress in the closet is just fine to wear to that party but getting the new one is more fun and exciting even if the accompanying price tag is annoying Itll be something interesting to complain about at said party later To the outside that might look like a luxury but to them it says Hey this I need all this for my sanity Reporting for this story I heard from all sorts of people about their hatespending habits One woman told me she despised spending over on an iPhone even as she insisted on replacing hers at least every two years she figured she should have one that works awesome And like many people she wont switch to another brand One man said hed really gotten into couponing and racking up points at his local grocery store but sometimes hes just got to have that bag of Doritos even if it costs the price of two bags three years ago People cited angrily buying dog toys fancy chocolates deodorant and Chex Mix at the airport Some mentioned doing more inevitable and even more rageinducing spending on bigticket items like rent Upon reflection Ive realized I have two categories of expenses I love to hate martinis at halfdecent New York restaurants and my internet bill Most people were aware that many purchases were things they could go without The Doritos guy knows he could go without the premium channels in his cable package but he doesnt think his bill would come down far enough to warrant the sacrifice By the end of my conversation with the iPhone lady she said shed started to wonder whether it might be better to wait to make the purchase the crack in her screen would be easy and cheap enough to fix But she doesnt have a lot of other big expenses at the moment Its not like her cars broken down so shell probably go ahead and buy a new phone She feels like its an investment in herself Hart the Illinois writer with a brandnew Stanley cup sees some of her spending as a way to reclaim power You dont have a choice in the economy and inflation and how thats affecting you but you kind of have a choice in how much you let it alter your lifestyle she said It feels like youre admitting defeat if youre just like Well now its just expensive so I wont do it In a hyperconsumerist society like the one we live in its a notion that tracks Maybe were all angry spending soldiers refusing to be deterred,Americans Hate High Prices but They Keep Spending Money Anyway Business Insider Weve all

pay later have also made it easier to buy something you cant entirely afford at this very minute I dont know what would force us to hit the breaking point for this degree of consumer spending Tassin said At the same time conspicuous consumption as in buying goods and services to show off a level of status is back on the rise among demographics that are once again jonesing to try new brands and becoming less sensitive to prices While lowerincome consumers are trading down from expensive namebrand products to cheaper alternatives in an effort to save money some younger and higherincome consumers are trading up and shrugging off the higher costs that come with that even if it irks them They want to achieve a higher social status They want to live a life that impresses others and being part of the popular crowd is important Tassin said Part of it is just like This is what it costs now And yes its a lot more expensive than it used to be but its still important to me to keep spending The misalignment between peoples stated attitude toward prices and their actual behavior isnt that outlandish our intentions and emotions often dont match our actions People say they want to eat healthy all the time and then find themselves in the ice cream aisle Its easy to say you want to cut back on spending given high prices but when a friend asks whether you want to go shopping its hard to say no Ravi Dhar a professor of management and marketing and the director of the Center for Customer Insights at Yale School of Management told me theres a sort of decoupling going on between peoples current situations and how they feel about the future They see a headline about people getting laid off or they know theres a global conflict going on so they feel more pessimistic about the economy and worried about costs But when it comes down to actually paying they still have a job and maybe even got a raise so they pony up They have uneasy feelings about the future and how it might change whereas expenditures and spending now is determined by the current state of affairs Dhar said Their predictions have become more pessimistic but not their behavior There is of course a needs vs wants question here Some items are necessities a home to live in food on the table gas in the car childcare healthcare Consumers are understandably frustrated at the costs of these things But in some instances people conflate what is a need whats a reasonable expectation and what sorts of tradeoffs they perhaps should make to achieve their financial goals None of us have to subscribe to six streaming services or escape to a lavish weekend getaway even if we tell ourselves thats what we deserve for stomaching the workday and staring down a grocery bill thats much higher than it used to be Advertisement To the outside that might look like a luxury but to them it says Hey this I need all this for my sanity Dhar said People are averse to loss and having to change their lifestyle to fit newfound financial constraints feels like losing Theres an element of stubbornness here of course that dress in the closet is just fine to wear to that party but getting the new one is more fun and exciting even if the accompanying price tag is annoying Itll be something interesting to complain about at said party later To the outside that might look like a luxury but to them it says Hey this I need all this for my sanity Reporting for this story I heard from all sorts of people about their hatespending habits One woman told me she despised spending over on an iPhone even as she insisted on replacing hers at least every two years she figured she should have one that works awesome And like many people she wont switch to another brand One man said hed really gotten into couponing and racking up points at his local grocery store but sometimes hes just got to have that bag of Doritos even if it costs the price of two bags three years ago People cited angrily buying dog toys fancy chocolates deodorant and Chex Mix at the airport Some mentioned doing more inevitable and even more rageinducing spending on bigticket items like rent Upon reflection Ive realized I have two categories of expenses I love to hate martinis at halfdecent New York restaurants and my internet bill Most people were aware that many purchases were things they could go without The Doritos guy knows he could go without the premium channels in his cable package but he doesnt think his bill would come down far enough to warrant the sacrifice By the end of my conversation with the iPhone lady she said shed started to wonder whether it might be better to wait to make the purchase the crack in her screen would be easy and cheap enough to fix But she doesnt have a lot of other big expenses at the moment Its not like her cars broken down so shell probably go ahead and buy a new phone She feels like its an investment in herself Hart the Illinois writer with a brandnew Stanley cup sees some of her spending as a way to reclaim power You dont have a choice in the economy and inflation and how thats affecting you but you kind of have a choice in how much you let it alter your lifestyle she said It feels like youre admitting defeat if youre just like Well now its just expensive so I wont do it In a hyperconsumerist society like the one we live in its a notion that tracks Maybe were all angry spending soldiers refusing to be deterred

Progressive are up more than this year The rallies suggest that insurance companies specifically those that focus on auto and homeowners insurance are successfully passing on inflation costs in those

risk profile are key positives However expectations for margins and growth seem optimistic and valuations are not attractive JPMorgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar said in an early April note to clients Another concern is socalled social inflation in which legal trends or regulatory changes can drive costs higher for insurance companies Two examples are the rising costs of personal injury verdicts in lawsuits and regulatory changes to allow consumers to involve third parties in the homerepair claims process Andrew McGee sector analyst at global research firm Third Bridge said social inflation is

continuing challenges US projects face Permitting a single project can still take years because of the multiple federal state and local hoops developers must jump through Ordering equipment is another challenge The US supply chain for offshore wind is still being built therefore projects are turning to European manufacturers to get blades gearboxes and other components Theres really only three suppliers that are serving the US market for wind turbines and the highcapacity electric cables that carry electricity back to shore said Clint Plummer head of New Yorkbased company Rise Light Power who was formerly at Danish wind giant rsted And their lead times seem to continue to get longer Compounding the problem is the fact that the US industry is so underdeveloped compared to Europe and Asia pushing US projects to the back of the line Because the US is more nascent in the development of our industry than either of those two mega markets it simply means that we have less influence than those other regions in being able to get the attention of the manufacturers Plummer said Friendly state and federal governments Despite persistent headwinds the biggest change over the past year has been that the Northeast is signing up for the electricity wind farms will generate Theres a simple explanation for that New England and Northeast states want to make their own energy according to Pedro Azagra Blzquez the CEO of offshore wind company Avangrid which is developing wind farms off the coasts of Massachusetts and New York For many years there has been no power generation being built Blzquez told CNN Now he said Northeast governors just want to make sure their states have energy New York has been aggressively pursuing offshore wind projects rebidding previously canceled projects and accepting those projects at higher prices The fact that that these projects that were in so much trouble were rebid and accepted at higher prices was a really positive sign for the industry Huntington said But it will also mean electricity from wind will initially come at a higher cost given supplychain constraints and high interest rates Blzquez and Plummer give the Biden administration high marks for setting an ambitious goal for offshore wind and trying to ease federal permitting for the projects But theyre also not overly worried about what a Trump administration could mean for

Monetary Fund,inflation,Despite gloomy predictions the global economy remains remarkably resilient with steady growth and inflation slowing almost as quickly as it rose The journey has been eventful starting with supplychain disruptions in the aftermath of the pandemic an energy and food crisis triggered by Russias war on Ukraine a considerable surge in inflation followed by a globally synchronized monetary policy tightening Global growth bottomed out at the end of at percent shortly after median headline inflation peaked at percent According to our latest World Economic Outlook projections growth this year and next will hold steady at percent with median headline inflation declining from percent at the end of to percent at the end of Most indicators continue to point to a soft landing We also project less economic scarring from the crises of the past four years although estimates vary across countries The US economy has already surged past its prepandemic trend But we now estimate that there will be more scarring for lowincome developing countries many of which are still struggling to turn the page from the pandemic and costofliving crises Resilient growth and rapid disinflation point toward favorable supply developments including the fading of energy price shocks and a striking rebound in labor supply supported by strong immigration in many advanced economies Monetary policy actions have helped anchor inflation expectations even if its transmission may have been more muted as fixedrate mortgages became more prevalent Despite these welcome developments numerous challenges remain and decisive actions are needed Inflation risks remain Bringing inflation back to target should remain the priority While inflation trends are encouraging we are not there yet Somewhat worryingly progress toward inflation targets has somewhat stalled since the beginning of the year This could be a temporary setback but there are reasons to remain vigilant Most of the good news on inflation came from the decline in energy prices and in goods inflation The latter has been helped by easing supplychain frictions as well as by the decline in Chinese export prices But oil prices have been rising recently in part due to geopolitical tensions and services inflation remains stubbornly high Further trade restrictions on Chinese exports could also push up goods inflation Economic divergences widen The resilient global economy also masks stark divergence across countries The strong recent performance of the United States reflects robust productivity and employment growth but also strong demand in an economy that remains overheated This calls for a cautious and gradual approach to easing by the Federal Reserve The fiscal stance out of line with longterm fiscal sustainability is of particular concern It raises shortterm risks to the disinflation process as well as longerterm fiscal and financial stability risks for the global economy Something will have to give Growth in the euro area will rebound but from very low levels as past shocks and tight monetary policy weigh on activity Continued high wage growth and persistent services inflation could delay the return of inflation to target However unlike in the United States there is little evidence of overheating and the European Central Bank will need to carefully calibrate the pivot toward monetary easing to avoid an inflation undershoot While labor markets appear strong that strength could prove illusory if European firms have been hoarding labor in anticipation of a pickup in activity that does not materialize Chinas economy remains affected by the downturn in its property sector Credit booms and busts never resolve themselves quickly and this one is no exception Domestic demand will remain lackluster unless strong measures address the root cause With depressed domestic demand external surpluses could well rise The risk is that this will further exacerbate trade tensions in an already fraught geopolitical environment Many other large emerging market economies are performing strongly sometimes benefiting from a reconfiguration of global supply chains and rising trade tensions between China and the US These countries footprint on the global economy is increasing Policy path Going forward policymakers should prioritize measures that help preserve or even enhance the resilience of the global economy The first such priority is to rebuild fiscal buffers Even as inflation recedes real interest rates remain high and sovereign debt dynamics have become less favorable Credible fiscal consolidations can help lower funding costs improve fiscal headroom and financial stability Unfortunately fiscal plans so far are insufficient and could be derailed further given the record number of elections this year Fiscal consolidations are never easy but it is best not to wait until markets dictate their conditions The right approach is to start now

a great achievement of the past few years has been the strengthening of monetary fiscal and financial policy frameworks especially for emerging market economies This has helped make the global financial system more resilient and avoid a permanent resurgence of inflation Going forward it is essential to preserve these improvements That includes protecting the hardwon independence of central banks Lastly the green transition requires major investments Cutting emissions is compatible with growth and activity has become much less emissionintensive in recent decades But emissions are still rising Much more needs to be done and done quickly Green investment has expanded at a healthy pace in advanced economies and China The greatest effort must now be made by other emerging market and developing economies which must massively increase their green investment growth and reduce their fossil fuel investment This will require technology transfer by other advanced economies and China as well as substantial private and public financing On these questions as well as on so many others multilateral frameworks and cooperation remain essential for progress This blog is based on Chapter of the April World Economic Outlook,Global Economy Remains Resilient Despite Uneven Growth Challenges Ahead International Monetary Fund Despite gloomy predictions the global economy remains remarkably resilient with steady growth and inflation slowing almost as quickly as it rose The journey has been eventful starting with supplychain disruptions in the aftermath of the pandemic an energy and food crisis triggered by Russias war on Ukraine a considerable surge in inflation followed by a globally synchronized monetary policy tightening Global growth bottomed out at the end of at percent shortly after median headline inflation peaked at percent According to our latest World Economic Outlook projections growth this year and next will hold steady at percent with median headline inflation declining from percent at the end of to percent at the end of Most indicators continue to point to a soft landing We also project less economic scarring from the crises of the past four years although estimates vary across countries The US economy has already surged past its prepandemic trend But we now estimate that there will be more scarring for lowincome developing countries many of which are still struggling to turn the page from the pandemic and costofliving crises Resilient growth and rapid disinflation point toward favorable supply developments including the fading of energy price shocks and a striking rebound in labor supply supported by strong immigration in many advanced economies Monetary policy actions have helped anchor inflation expectations even if its transmission may have been more muted as fixedrate mortgages became more prevalent Despite these welcome developments numerous challenges remain and decisive actions are needed Inflation risks remain Bringing inflation back to target should remain the priority While inflation trends are encouraging we are not there yet Somewhat worryingly progress toward inflation targets has somewhat stalled since the beginning of the year This could be a temporary setback but there are reasons to remain vigilant Most of the good news on inflation came from the decline in energy prices and in goods inflation The latter has been helped by easing supplychain frictions as well as by the decline in Chinese export prices But oil prices have been rising recently in part due to geopolitical tensions and services inflation remains stubbornly high Further trade restrictions on Chinese exports could also push up goods inflation Economic divergences widen The resilient global economy also masks stark divergence across countries The strong recent performance of the United States reflects robust productivity and employment growth but also strong demand in an economy that remains overheated This calls for a cautious and gradual approach to easing by the Federal Reserve The fiscal stance out of line with longterm fiscal sustainability is of particular concern It raises shortterm risks to the disinflation process as well as longerterm fiscal and financial stability risks for the global economy Something will have to give Growth in the euro area will rebound but from very low levels as past shocks and tight monetary policy weigh on activity Continued high wage growth and persistent services inflation could delay the return of inflation to target However unlike in the United States there is little evidence of overheating and the European Central Bank will need to carefully calibrate the pivot toward monetary easing to avoid an inflation undershoot While labor markets appear strong that strength could prove illusory if European firms have been hoarding labor in anticipation of a pickup in activity that does not materialize Chinas economy remains affected by the downturn in its property sector Credit booms and busts never resolve themselves quickly and this one is no exception Domestic demand will remain lackluster unless strong measures address the root cause With depressed domestic demand external surpluses could well rise The risk is that this will further exacerbate trade tensions in an already fraught geopolitical environment Many other large emerging market economies are performing strongly sometimes benefiting from a reconfiguration of global supply chains and rising trade tensions between China and the US These countries footprint on the global economy is increasing Policy path Going forward policymakers should prioritize measures that help preserve or even enhance the resilience of the global economy The first such priority is to rebuild fiscal buffers Even as inflation recedes real interest rates remain high and sovereign debt dynamics have become less favorable Credible fiscal consolidations can help lower funding costs improve fiscal headroom and financial stability Unfortunately fiscal plans so far are insufficient and could be derailed further given the record number of elections this year Fiscal consolidations are never easy but it is best not to wait until markets dictate their conditions The right approach is to start now gradually and credibly Once inflation is under control credible multiyear consolidations will help pave the way for further monetary policy easing The successful US fiscal consolidation and monetary accommodation episode comes to mind as an example to emulate The second priority is to reverse the decline in medium term growth prospects Some of that decline comes from increased misallocation of capital and labor within sectors and countries Facilitating faster and more efficient resource allocation will

rates on credit card debt or loans anytime soon I dont see how you can justify cutting rates with a job market that looks like this an economy that is growing at a pretty good clip and inflation is still running almost above their target said Gregory Heym chief economist at real estate service company Brown Harris Stevens Following its March Federal Open Market Committee meeting Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed still expects to make rate cuts at some point this year But Powell emphasized that the decision to cut interest rates depended on inflation and that the Fed remains committed to bringing inflation back to its target The Fed indicated at its final meeting in that it anticipated making multiple interest rate cuts in The Federal Open Market Committee voted at its first two meetings in to continue holding the benchmark interest rate steady at a target range of to The Fed will vote on rates at its upcoming meetings scheduled for April to May and June to Inflation isnt something that can be tackled overnight and its still taking a toll on US households and consumers Heres a quick primer on the state of inflation and steps you can take to prepare for whats ahead What the latest CPI data tells us At the inflation rate is still lower than rates we saw last year it was at in March However even though prices arent increasing by as much as they were a year ago theyre still higher than they were before the pandemic Since the beginning of the year the indexs inflation data has bucked expectations and continued inching upward with core index increasing in January February and March And overall inflation hasnt been this high since September The Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI is one of the most closely watched gauges of US inflation tracking data on products

Inflationary pressures happen over time and require historical context to understand For example in the average cost of a movie ticket was Today watching a film in the theater will easily cost you for the ticket alone never mind the popcorn candy or soda A bill years ago would buy someone more than double what it buys today And while wages have also risen over the past few decades they havent kept up with inflation Consumers have less purchasing power Are we still in a period of high inflation Inflation affects everyone differently and it isnt determined by observation Its backed by a consensus of experts who rely on market indexes and research Along with the CPI increase the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis also increased in March Core inflation excluding volatile energy and food was up year over year and from the previous month The PCE index includes all goods and services and is the Federal Reserves preferred inflation gauge The BLS also puts together a Producer Price Index which tracks inflation from the perspective of the producers of consumer goods measuring changes in seller prices in industries like manufacturing agriculture construction natural gas and electricity The current inflationary period started back in April when consumer prices jumped at the fastest pace in over a decade Inflation was originally thought to be temporary while economies bounced back from COVID But as months progressed supply chain bottlenecks persisted and prices skyrocketed The US was then hammered by unanticipated shocks to the economy including subsequent COVID variants lockdowns in China and Russias invasion of Ukraine leading to a choked supply chain and soaring energy and food prices How the Federal Reserves rate hikes relate to inflation The Fed moderates inflation and employment rates by managing the money supply and setting interest rates Part of its mission is to keep average inflation at a steady rate When the Fed increases the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing and lending it restricts how much money is available to borrow and spend which has an impact on economic growth Banks pass on rate hikes to consumers meaning everything from credit card APRs to interest rates on personal loans tick up Consequently this can drive consumers investors and businesses to pause their investments leading to a rebalance in the supplyanddemand scales In general when interest rates are low the economy and inflation grow And when interest rates are high the economy and inflation slow When the inflation rate hit in March the Fed set off an aggressive sequence of interest rate hikes in an attempt to slow the economy and curb prices by reducing consumer borrowing After rate hikes the Federal Reserve paused interest rates at a target range of to in July The Federal Reserves next meeting to vote on interest rates is slated for April May What does inflation mean for you Periods of high inflation make it harder to afford everyday essentials Interest rate hikes mean it costs more for businesses and consumers to take out loans so buying a car or home gets more expensive As interest rates increase liquidity in securities and cryptocurrency markets decreases causing those markets to dip Credit card debt and other forms of highinterest debt become more expensive Though inflation has been easing for the past few months its still unpredictable Fed officials stated after their December meeting that inflation had eased voting nearly unanimously that the policy rate will be lower by the end of but tempered expectations of rate cuts at its first meeting this year In the short term experts recommend avoiding taking on new debt unless absolutely necessary When interest rates are high the goal is to put off borrowing money as long as possible said Summer Red AFC and Education Manager for the Association for Financial Counseling Planning Education If you have to borrow money at high interest rates be sure to shop around for the best interest rate and make sure that your loans do not have a prepayment penalty so that you can pay off the loan early One option is applying for a debt consolidation loan that could combine any highinterest variable debt into a lowerinterest fixedrate loan and establishing a payoff plan Getting a balance transfer card can also help you avoid high interest for a period of time If the economy continues to be volatile its also important for households to build up a financial

according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics This is the first month of yearoveryear acceleration in US grocery prices since August breaking an month streak of deceleration per a note from JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman Since COVID began in March the cost of food at home has jumped But the cost of dining out continues to grow at a higher pace due to persistent labor inflation higher commodities costs and other reasons Since COVID the price of dining out has increased In March meals at restaurants and bars cost more than a year ago though its the smallest month change since June per BLS economist Steve Reed Prices are up compared to February Reed said that restaurant prices have been a little bit slower to decelerate but it has sort of finally been decelerating recently Consumers are still paying up Wells Fargo agricultural economist Michael Swanson told Yahoo Finance As consumers we havent said no yet When you go out and look at restaurants theyre still quite full so the restaurant industry is saying Okay if the demand is there Im going to price accordingly Swanson said Some grocery items are cheaper compared to the month prior including cereal and bakery products down ham down shelfstable fish and seafood down ice cream and related products down butter down and peanut butter down Cereal and bakery products saw their largest monthovermonth decrease since the BLS first started monitoring the index in per Reed Swanson said competition has caught up for producers within this category driving down prices Theyre really starting to focus on market share Theyre using those promotions whether its buy one get one coupons all those traditional ways of trying to get consumers to buy their brand and not somebody elses he said Butter saw its biggest monthovermonth drop since May while sugar and sweets had their largest decline since July The category has been under pressure as cocoa prices surpassed per metric ton for the first time last month Compared to a year ago though sweets are up as producers face higher costs when it comes to ingredients packing labor and transportation Story continues The consumer is thinking sweets companies are making outrageous profits but when we look at the industry statistics theyre well below where they were preCOVID even further below where they were maybe back five six years ago Swanson said For example Hersheys HSY operating profit declined year over year to million in Q A shopper takes a carton of eggs from the cooler in a grocery store in Washington DC on Saturday April Tom WilliamsCQRoll Call Inc via Getty Images Tom Williams via Getty Images Prices ticked higher in March in categories such as eggs up month over month lettuce pork poultry and beef and veal When it comes to eggs the

CALM reported another case of avian influenza or bird flu at its Texas facility The impact of the flu cannot be eliminated entirely said Swanson so now the industry has to focus on reducing the severity of the issue and mitigating the spread of the disease Lettuce saw the highest monthly jump since July up in March and up compared to last year as seasonality and trucking costs created volatility in pricing according to Swanson Beef and veal prices are up compared to last year as cattle supply remains lower The cost of ground beef saw an increase of last month to per pound Swanson

economic pessimism has been bafflingly persistent despite major indicators showing that the economy is actually strong Unemployment is low inflation is significantly down from its peak if sticky and ticking up in the last month wages are up the stock market is hitting new alltime highs and it looks like the Federal Reserve might be able to keep the US out of a recession Surveys are beginning to capture growing consumer confidence but for President Joe Biden the question is whether its rising quickly enough for him to avoid being penalized in the election He had no control over the pandemicrattled economy he inherited but voters may nevertheless blame him for it as they have rightly or wrongly blamed their presidents for the countrys economic troubles in the past Voters have mentioned economic issues think inflation jobs and more as their greatest concern since in a longrunning and ongoing Gallup survey Another February Morning ConsultBloomberg survey of voters in swing states also found that the economy is the most important issue and could therefore decide the outcome of the election Recent polls show Trump with an to point edge over Biden on which candidate would better handle the economy In some ways this isnt a surprise The economy was generally good under Trump except for the Covidinduced recession under Biden high inflation has been the biggest economic story If Biden is to turn his fortunes around hell have to convince the American public that the economy is in fact better than it feels and will continue to improve and that its better than they remember under Trump The fundamental problem for Biden and the Democrats is that while the rate of inflation is down its not going backwards GOP pollster Whit Ayres said Its hard to persuade people that things are better Americans think the economy is worse under Biden Americans have been stubbornly downbeat about the economy under Biden with Gallups Economic Confidence Index hovering between and for months on a scale of to That number is derived from monthly surveys of US adults in which they are asked to rate national economic conditions with signifying that all respondents say the economy is excellent or good and that it is getting better and signifying that they all say it is poor and getting worse according to Gallup The data suggests that the more economic confidence has plummeted the more the economy has become an issue in the presidential race About percent of Americans cited the economy as the most important problem facing the country in the most recent results from Gallups running survey although its worth noting that immigration is now climbing fast on this chart To be sure theres evidence the link between the economy and presidents approval might be weakening as partisan loyalties shift but it doesnt appear to be gone entirely It does seem like things might be finally turning a corner for Biden Surveys including Gallups have shown a marked uptick in economic confidence in recent months even if the figures are still overall well below what Biden would like to see There has been substantial empirical progress made Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi said I think if they continue making that case the public slowly and surely will come around by the time they start voting in October and November for president The Biden and Trump economies were both pretty good but only one president has gotten credit Theres no denying that the economy was good under Trump and the prepandemic economy is now seen as a baseline against which Bidens economy is being judged But Trump arrived in office when the economy was already pretty strong He was just riding on the coattails of a yearlong economic recovery said Al R Bustamante deputy director of worker power and economic security at Roosevelt Forward the progressive political arm of the Roosevelt Institute The economy continued to grow modestly on his watch until the pandemic hit in and after that his stimulus checks kept it buoyant for a while The stock market saw significant growth under Trump and at least for the last year under Biden too more on that later But some of Trumps signature economic policies have also been found to have had little to no measurable effect on the economy and a few might have even hurt Multiple studies have shown that the Trump tariffs at best had a neutral effect on the economy and at worst cost America hundreds of thousands of jobs and higher prices for consumers And his tax cuts which increased investment in the economy and contributed to modest wage growth in the short term fell far short of Republicans promise that they would pay for themselves and are projected to significantly raise federal debt and increase income inequality Biden on the other hand faced the immediate task upon assuming office of heading off a recession as the country started to bounce back from the pandemic The US did recover from that pandemic economic slump But there is evidence that his policies including the stimulus checks he issued contributed to an inflationary spiral The US did however manage to curb inflation faster than other economically developed countries while also maintaining much lower levels of unemployment and higher wage growth The Federal Reserve might deserve most of the credit for that given its carefully timed interest rate hikes But Biden also has a very successful legislative record including the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act laws that experts say can help bolster the economy And he took steps to reduce pandemicinduced pressure on supply chains making it easier for truck drivers to become licensed and allowing some major ports to operate nonstop The US economy is growing faster than projected driven largely by consumer spending and the Federal Reserves successful efforts to get inflation under control without triggering a recession While inflation has come down substantially from its percent peak in June it still remains above the Feds target rate and ongoing progress toward our percent inflation objective is not assured Fed chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in early March In February inflation was higher than economists projected at percent adding to the uncertainty But Americans wages are now growing faster than inflation which should relieve some of the pressure of higher prices The problem for Biden is that the memory of peak inflation is still fresh and not everyone has experienced wage growth equally Bustamante said that younger workers and low earners account for the lions share of wage growth in the current economy The president should speak to these challenges acknowledging that some people are suffering and things are not exactly where they want it to be without selling short whats working Amandi said What is working is Bidens strategy on jobs Unemployment reached its lowest level since under Biden and the US gained a record million new jobs in fueled by a recovery in the labor market as vaccines became available and the country opened up Job creation has remained strong in the years since but slowed to million jobs added in The stock market has also been setting new record highs after growing a whopping percent last year driven by optimism that the Fed will soon cut rates and that companies in the tech and energy sectors have outperformed expectations This means that Trump no longer has the only claim to a strong stock market during the last few years Instead hes had to resort to claiming credit unconvincingly for the current market For instance he recently posted on Truth Social that the US was experiencing a TRUMP STOCK MARKET in anticipation of him winning the election Bidens challenge is speaking to Americans who are still hurting The picture of the economy isnt entirely rosy After a brief spike in savings rates during the pandemic due to a series of stimulus checks Americans are now saving less than they were prepandemic There are a few reasons for this Of course everything costs more but interest rates are also higher meaning that its now more expensive to borrow And higher borrowing costs have eaten into Americans savings In spite of all of that Americans are still buying stuff in droves and not just necessities Restaurants airlines and hotels have been some of the biggest beneficiaries Theres a question however of how long this can last before the money dries up Americans are pulling from their nowdepleted savings and amassing recordhigh debt on credit cards and other revolving plans in which consumers can repeatedly borrow money up to a set limit and repay in installments Young adults in particular many of whom are also struggling with high student loan debt are increasingly falling behind on their credit card payments At some point something has to give This might be part of the reason many Americans still yearn for the economy of when they had more cash on hand and didnt have to resort to putting purchases on a credit card Still Bustamante isnt too worried about the longterm economic impacts given that the Fed is expected to cut interest rates this year which should provide relief to households carrying large balances and make it easier for them to pay off debt But if the Fed waits much longer Americans might not feel the effects before the November election So while most of the economic indicators spell good news for Biden and for America the question is whether he can persuade voters who feel otherwise and remain nostalgic for Trumps economy The general perception is that the economy was better before the pandemic than it is now said Ayres the GOP pollster And that perception is powerful politically Clarification This story has been updated with Al

dose of reality about inflation It started Monday with a New York Fed consumer survey showing expectations for rent increases over the next year rising dramatically to or percentage points higher than the February survey The outlook for food gas medical care and education costs all rose as well On Tuesday the National Federation of Independent Business showed that optimism among its members hit an year low with members citing inflation as their primary concern Wednesday brought a higherthanexpected consumer price reading that showed the month inflation rate at while the Labor Department on Thursday reported that wholesale prices showed their biggest oneyear gain since April Finally a report Friday indicated that import prices rose more than expected in March and notched the biggest

closely watched consumer sentiment survey came in lower than expected with respondents pushing up their inflation outlook as well Still ready to cut sometime Fed officials took notice of the higher readings but did not sound panic alarms as most said they still expect to cut later this year The economy has come a long way toward achieving better balance and reaching our percent inflation goal New York Fed President John Williams said But we have not seen the total alignment of our dual mandate quite yet Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she sees inflation durably if unevenly drifting back to as well but noted that it may take more time than I had previously thought for that to happen Minutes released Wednesday from the March Fed meeting showed officials were concerned about higher inflation and looking for more convincing evidence it is on a steady path lower watch now While consumer and producer price indexes captured the markets attention this week its worth remembering that the Feds attention is elsewhere when it comes to inflation Policymakers instead follow the personal consumption expenditures price index which has not been released yet for March There are two key differences between the CPI and the PCE indexes Primarily the Commerce Departments PCE adjusts for changes in consumer behavior so if people are substituting say chicken for beef because of price changes that would be reflected more in PCE than CPI Also PCE places less weighting on housing costs an important consideration with rental and other shelter prices holding higher In February the PCE readings were for all items and exfood and energy or the core reading that Fed officials watch more closely The next release wont come until April Citigroup economists said that current tracking data points to core edging lower to better but still a distance from the Feds goal Adding up the signals Moreover there are multiple other signals showing that the Fed has a long way to go Socalled sticky price CPI as calculated by the Atlanta Fed edged up to on a month basis in March while flexible CPI surged a full percentage point albeit to only Sticky price CPI entails items such as housing motor vehicle insurance and medical care services while flexible price is concentrated in food energy and vehicle prices Finally the Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE which throws out extreme readings on either side to in February again a ways from the central banks goal A bright spot for the Fed is that the economy has been able to tolerate high rates with little impact to the employment picture or growth

exclude wages of topcoded individuals because topcoded earnings will show up as having zero wage growth which is unlikely to be accurate Individuals with earnings information that has been imputed by the BLS because of missing earnings data See for example Hirsch and Schumacher and Bollinger and Hirsch for research showing that using imputed wage data can be problematic Individuals whose hourly pay is below the current federal minimum wage for tipbased workers Individuals employed in agricultural occupations such as farm workers These restrictions yield an average of earnings observations each month Constructing the wage growth tracker statistic Once we have constructed the individual hourly earnings data we match the hourly earnings of individuals observed in both the current month and months earlier The matching algorithm results in about individual wage growth observations per month We then compute the median of the distribution of individual month wage changes for each month Explore the data The final step is to smooth the data using a threemonth moving average That is we average the current month median wage growth with the medians for the prior two months The chart below shows the unsmoothed and threemonth average versions of the median wage growth series Note that our matched dataset has a slightly greater share of older more educated workers in professional jobs than does the sample of all wage and salary earners This is primarily due to the requirement that the individual has earnings in both the current and prior year Older more educated workers are

different workers in each period Chart plots the time series of the median along with the mean and the th and th percentiles of the individual wage growth distribution all shown as threemonth moving averages The mean wage growth measure displays more variability over time than does the median The mean wage growth uniformly lies above the median because the distribution of individual wage growth is asymmetric The asymmetry can be seen by noting that the gap between the th percentile wage growth and the median wage growth is about percentage points whereas the gap between the th percentile and the median is only about percentage points Also note that the th and th percentiles have generally moved in line with the median over time so that the interquartile range a measure of dispersion has

changes in our data specifically the percent of individual wage growth falling in the range of percent and percent For reference also plotted is the median individual wage growth Notice that the proportion of zero wage changes increased during both of the last two recessions During the Great Recession wage freezes became especially prevalent and have persisted at a high rate through much of

Social brianmuddradio iHeartRadio Use the Talkback feature the microphone button on our stations page in the iHeart app Todays Entry Good Morning Brian Forever grateful for all your information and analysis I see some in the media and certain organizations are saying many negative statements about this bill HB as signed by Governor DeSantis Whats your take on this Thank you and God bless Bottom Line Thank you and may God bless you as well The new law in question is Floridas new Employment Regulations law The bill was signed into law by Governor Desantis on Friday and takes effect July st To your point the news medias coverage and response has been commonly critical and often dire in the presentation Related headlines include USA Today Heat protections for outdoor workers banned in Florida with new law Heat protections for outdoor workers banned in Florida with new law Florida Politics Gov DeSantis strips worker wage heat protection powers from cities Gov DeSantis strips worker wage heat protection powers from cities Orlando Weekly Its Unjust Florida Gov DeSantis signs bill banning local heat safety and wage law So about now you likely are wondering why it is that Governor DeSantis and the state legislature would want workers to cook in the heat and make less money to do it Lets start with whats actually in the law The official summary analysis of the change in law is as follows The federal Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA provides workers with minimum wage overtime pay record keeping and child labor protections for full and parttime workers in both the public and private sectors The FLSA allows states to expand the rights of employers and employees Florida generally follows federal law on overtime pay and occupational health and safety The Occupational Safety and Health Act of is the federal labor law governing occupational health and safety in the private sector and federal government Currently there are no specific federal or state laws that provide heat exposure protections for outdoor workers Regarding heat exposure protections the bill prohibits political subdivisions from Requiring an employer including an employer contracting with the political subdivision to meet or provide heat exposure requirements not otherwise required under state or federal law Giving preference or considering or seeking information in a competitive solicitation to an employer based on the employers heat exposure requirements Regarding Floridas wage and employment benefits law effective September the bill prohibits political subdivisions from Seeking to control or affect the wages or employment benefits provided by its vendors contractors service providers or other parties doing business with it through its purchasing or contracting procedures Using evaluation factors qualification of bidders or otherwise awarding preferences on the basis of wages or employment benefits provided by its vendors contractors service providers or other parties doing business with the political subdivision The bill removes the ability of local governments to require a minimum wage for certain employees under the terms of a contract and provides that the bills revisions to Floridas wage and employment benefits law do not impair any contract entered into before September The bill prohibits local governments from adopting or enforcing any ordinance resolution order rule policy or contract requirement regulating scheduling including predictive scheduling by a private employer except as expressly authorized or required by state or federal law rule or regulation or pursuant to federal grant requirements The bill does not appear to have a fiscal impact on state or local government The new law passed along partisan lines and was a priority of the Florida Chamber of Commerce which is to say that business interests were behind its passage The reason for the timing of this new law is twofold addressing two matters impacted by it Lets start with the preemption of local heat ordinances on businesses Last July MiamiDade advanced a proposal to create a countywide ordinance creating heat standards for outdoor workers The ordinance sought to impose by my count new mandates on employers with outdoor employees Among the mandatory requirements of the proposed county ordinance are Mandatory Access to Shaded Recovery Periods anytime the heat index was to reach or higher Access to a sufficient quantity of drinking water at all times provided free of charge to the employee Employers must implement preshift meetings to discuss drinking plenty of water and to remind employers of the shaded recovery periods Employers must remind employees to drink water at least every two hours Theres obviously much more to it including a whole host of protocols that must go into effect if theres any indication of a potential medical issue with an employee Ill address this both as a former business owner with dozens of employees and as an analyst First and foremost it obviously doesnt serve the employer of an employee who is harmed by unsafe work conditions any more than it serves the employee Thats not to say that some employers arent more responsible than others in their care of employees however obviously no companys interest is served by a worker who cant work due to health issues associated with work conditions The idea is that there should be a balance in these matters where minimum safety standards are ensured for employees while potentially onerous restrictions on employers should be avoided Its clear within just the few proposed mandates I highlighted that what MiamiDade has been attempting to do is onerous For employers to have provide mandatory paid time for workers to have shaded recovery periods anytime the heat index reaches not even the temperature but the subjective heat index is an absurd requirement for employers to have to keep up with that would only add expense to projects and set companies up for liability which is a theme What for example is a sufficient amount of water thats supposed to always be available for free Preshift meeting to discuss drinking water and shade Thats all additional expense Likewise for supervisors to have to conduct twohour rotations to remind employees about drinking water This kind of stuff plays well in the news because it sounds like the local government is attempting to care for vulnerable employees In reality these are a series of mandates adding employer cost to perform work which would negatively impact the cost for Floridians to have work performed adding to inflation and mandatory but subjective standards that could easily setup employers to be sued even when acting in good faith There is no doubt that if the MiamiDade proposal were allowed to persist it would drive up costs and lead to fewer jobs being created Now one could still say that the potential health benefit would be worth it Thats where balance comes into play Floridas workplace health standard is the federal governments workplace health standard OSHA If what is proposed by MiamiDade is truly needed as a matter of balance it should be evidenced and enacted at the federal level so all Americans are protected under that standard and theres workplace consistency within industries Floridas new law prevents local governments from enacting their own subjective standards a la what

Conversation,employment wages,As they kick off their careers young people often have to navigate a maze of shortterm and casual jobs In Australia many of them also wish to work more hours than their current jobs allow leading to a situation called underemployment Casual employment and underemployment often go hand in hand But just how common are these experiences during Australians early careers and what effect do they have on their future wage prospects Read more Its getting even harder to find fulltime work So more people are taking second parttime jobs Setting the trajectory of young peoples careers Early underemployment casual employment and joblessness can greatly impact an individuals career prospects later in life Our study assessing data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia HILDA Survey explored this issue in depth A large number of young men and women were found to have experienced underemployment when they first started their careers But Australian women more so than men endured extended and repeated periods of underemployment This year we explored these trends in a further study analysing years of data from the HILDA Survey to find out the common career paths young Australians take as they start working We started by looking into how often young people encounter a combination of casual work underemployment periods of not working and unemployment in the early stages of their careers Read more HILDA data show womens job prospects improving relative to mens and the COVID changes might have helped Our research revealed a stark reality Only of young workers in our study had secured permanent jobs matching their working hours preferences within five years of graduating The more than half that remained were dealing with employment situations that fell short of their ideal Of this underemployed group the majority of whom were women or had lower levels of education were stuck in a cycle of shortterm and casual jobs and experienced careers marked by periods out of work and unemployment Finding a stable and satisfying job early on is a steep challenge for young Australians Underemployment creates a pay gap Is moving between jobs while young good or bad for future earnings One argument is that switching between different shortterm jobs during early careers can actually help young people gain work experience in different roles give them time to explore their preferences and skills and learn about better job opportunities Ultimately this can improve job matching and lead to higher wages later in life However another argument is that when young people move randomly between jobs companies or industries it can slow down the rate at which they learn and grow This is because they might not stick around at any one place long enough to really build up their experience We explored this issue in Australia and made three central findings Young Australians facing underemployment and casual employment at the start of their careers earn lower hourly wages on average Even those who end up in permanent positions but are underemployed earn about cents for every dollar earned by their peers in fulltime permanent jobs This wage gap between those with stable jobs early on and those who face early career challenges does diminish over a year period For young people who are primarily unemployed or inactive at the very start of their careers wage penalties not only continue but get worse over time Importantly among this group men experienced the most significant wage penalties These findings tell us that jobless underemployed youth face the heaviest career and wage penalties in later life Whats next A positive sign is the fact that the wage gap between young people in stable jobs and those facing instability closes over a year period However this result does not fully address concerns about the uncertain career paths young people face Our study ultimately revealed that young people who cycle through shortterm jobs and underemployment suffer wage penalties for a significant portion of their careers These penalties have implications for their lifetime earnings and cumulative wages Addressing such lifelong setbacks requires us to create a more inclusive labour market that accommodates underemployed workers and those with nonstandard employment experiences This could mean introducing policies that promote job security fair wages and benefits for workers in nontraditional jobs Think tank Per Capita suggests that better integrating underemployed workers into the workforce could significantly improve economic growth and national productivity So how do we help underemployed and jobless people find better jobs In many ways underemployed jobless youth face the biggest career and wage penalties later in life They often fall into precarious employment situations because their skills do not match what employers need or because they dont have the contacts networks and connections to find appropriate job opportunities To deal with youth unemployment we need better tools that enable us to show young people where the best jobs are and also guide them on the best pathways to stable and secure jobs Many advanced tools that match skills to jobs are either not currently accessible without a paid subscription or not effective enough at matching young people with the right job Governments industries and employment services should prioritise building new free tools that can facilitate better job searches and transitions between occupations to

that during the period from October to October total healthcare employment increased by while vacancies dropped by indicating a positive shift in the workforce landscape North Carolina hospitals have increased employment faster than the national average and all neighboring states in the Southeast during the last decade North Carolinas hospitals added more than jobs between and a compound annual growth rate of which was faster than the growth nationwide of North Carolina hospitals grew their staff roughly faster than Georgia double the pace in Virginia three times faster than Tennessee and four times faster than South Carolina Nursing and residential care facilities however have lost more than positions in the last few years a loss that is more than twice as severe as the national average or any neighboring state Ambulatory care services which means outpatient care has increased employment since but at a slower rate than neighboring states And employment in home healthcare services has declined each year since Operational constraints hinder wage increases and benefit enhancements in nursing and residential care facilities in general it has been harder for them to compete with wages and benefits that nonhealthcare employers offer To help attract and retain workers hospitals and health systems have not only increased their wages but they are also offering new benefits to help improve workers quality of life reduce feelings of burnout and more Healthcare providers have boosted pay for some frontline occupations to attract and retain talent Wage gains between and were faster than the state median for several key healthcare occupations including orderlies nursing assistants registered nurses healthcare support workers and physician assistants There

bottom of the income scale has been intense with food service occupations farming fishing and forestry occupations and personal care and service occupations all seeing stronger wage gains between and than healthcare support occupations It still takes a long time to hire several key frontline occupations like medical assistants and nursing assistants The average hiring process over the last six months took days or longer and was even more extended for some key frontline positions Also employee absenteeism reported due to childcare and transportation issues has increased The dramatic increase

shortages occurring in hospitals particularly intense shortages are anticipated in in the Wake Region and Northwestern parts of the state which may see a larger rise in the aging population Medicaid

the number of nursing bachelors degrees awarded in the last decade but the number of associate degrees has been essentially flat This is a particular indicator we can be working on Inadequate pay is causing some nursing instructors to leave the classroom Hospitals like UNC Health Wayne in Goldsboro are stepping up to help They are paying the salary and benefits of one clinical nursing instructor at Wayne Community College for five years to help ensure their community has the workforce pipeline they need There is growing recognition that we cannot simply educate our way out of this problem

health care providers follow through on potential cuts to hours and benefits This story also ran on LAist It can be republished for free A medical industry challenge to a new minimum wage ordinance in one Southern California city suggests layoffs and reductions in hours and benefits including cuts to premium pay and vacation time could be one result of a state law set to begin phasing in in June However some experts are skeptical of that possibility The California Hospital Association brought a partly successful legal challenge to Inglewoods minimum wage ordinance which barred employers from taking those sorts of steps to offset their higher costs Layoffs reductions in premium pay rates reductions in nonwage benefits reductions in hours and increased charges are consequences of an employer having less money to spendwhich will necessarily be the case given the significant increase in spending on wages due to the minimum wage the association said in its lawsuit Additional examples include reducing health coverage and charging for parking or workrelated equipment Inglewood voters approved the ordinance in November nearly a year before California legislators enacted a minimum wage for health workers Those statewide higher wages are to be phased in starting in June under Californias firstinthenation law but Gov Gavin Newsom has since said they are too expensive as the state faces a deficit estimated between billion and billion Its unclear if lawmakers will agree to a delay or take other steps to reduce the cost US District Judge Dale S Fischer agreed with the hospital industry in a March tentative ruling when he shot down the portion of Inglewoods ordinance banning layoffs and clawbacks by employers while allowing the rest of the ordinance to remain in effect He gave the sides time to object to his preliminary decision though none did EMAIL SIGNUp Subscribe to California Healthlines free Daily Edition Your Email Address Sign Up The California Hospital Association represents more than hospitals and was a key backer of the states carefully crafted compromise law which notably contains none of the employee safeguards included in the Inglewood

organization is figuring out how to pay for the higher wages said Joanne Spetz director of the Philip R Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco Since labor costs are the largest part of any health care organizations costs its hard to figure out how to reduce spending without looking at labor costs Providers can try to increase revenues by bargaining for higher reimbursements from commercial insurers she said Public hospitals nursing homes and community clinics get most of their money through MediCal the states Medicaid program Providers could reduce the services they offer pare back charity care and cut or delay capital investments Spetz said In the long term she expects some combination of spending cuts and revenue increases Both the state law and local ordinance cover far more than doctors and nurses with a definition of health worker that includes janitors housekeepers groundskeepers security guards food service workers laundry workers and clerical staff The most recent estimate by the Health Care Program at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley Labor Center is that as many as health workers would make an average of extra in the laws first year a average pay bump mainly benefiting lowerincome workers of color and women State finance officials project that well over workers will benefit Researchers didnt include layoffs and other potential staffing and benefit reductions when they projected the state laws costs and benefits said Laurel Lucia the programs director But she pointed to initial projections by hospitals doctors and business and taxpayer groups that the wage hike would cost billion annually thereby imperiling services and resulting in higher premiums and higher costs for state and local governments It seems like a contradiction to say this laws going to cost billions of dollars while at the same time saying its going to reduce workers total compensation said Lucia who projects a far lower price tag She added that state finance officials had anticipated that MediCal reimbursements would reflect the increased labor costs while Medicare would eventually at least partially compensate for the higher labor costs Michael Reich chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at UC Berkeleys Institute for Research on Labor and Employment and affiliated economist Justin Wiltshire recently argued that Californias new minimum wage law for fastfood workers wont result in mass layoffs and price increases as some have predicted Health care is much different than fast food Reich acknowledged but he argued for much the same positive result A higher minimum wage will make it easier and cheaper for hospitals to recruit and retain these workers The cost savings and the productivity benefits of more experienced workers could offset much of the labor cost increase Reich said The hospital association filed its lawsuit against Inglewoods ordinance in July while it was still opposing early versions of the statewide minimum wage legislation Among many other provisions the statewide law put on hold an initiative to cap hospital executives salaries in Los Angeles The hospital associations legal challenge referenced in part layoffs and reduced working hours imposed by Centinela Hospital Medical Center after Inglewoods ordinance took effect But Centinela said the reduction was entirely unrelated to the ordinance and that all staff were offered alternate positions which many accepted Centinela Hospital also has since added many more jobs in new clinical positions above minimum wage scale the hospital said in a statement Service Employees International UnionUnited Healthcare Workers West the prime backer of both the local ordinance and the statewide law sued the hospital in April alleging that it cut workers hours to offset the higher minimum wage The case is still pending The union did not respond to repeated requests for comment In a court filing however the union and city of Inglewood said similar employer restrictions in previous minimum wage laws have survived The ordinance merely sets the backdrop for collective bargaining negotiations and does not bar employers from locking out employees or hiring replacement workers during a strike Employers can still lay off workers or reduce their hours they said so long as they dont do so to fund the higher minimum wage But Fischer agreed with the hospital association that layoffs and reductions in employees total compensation packages are obvious responses by an employer to rising compensation costs Restricting employers options would violate federal labor relations rules he said The minimum wage an employer has to pay its employees will invariably affect the total amount of compensation it is able or willing to pay he wrote This will then invariably affect the number of employees it can retain and the number of hours those employees will be scheduled to work,California Health Workers May Face Rude Awakening With Minimum Wage Law California Healthline SACRAMENTO Nearly a halfmillion health workers who stand to benefit from Californias nationleading minimum wage law could be in for a rude awakening if hospitals and other health care providers follow through on potential cuts to hours and benefits This story also ran on LAist It can be republished for free A medical industry challenge to a new minimum wage ordinance in one Southern California city suggests layoffs and reductions in hours and benefits including cuts to premium pay and vacation time could be one result of a state law set to begin phasing in in June However some experts are skeptical of that possibility The California Hospital Association brought a partly successful legal challenge to Inglewoods minimum wage ordinance which barred employers from taking those sorts of steps to offset their higher costs Layoffs reductions in premium pay rates reductions in nonwage benefits reductions in hours and increased charges are consequences of an employer having less money to spendwhich will necessarily be the case given the significant increase in spending on wages due to the minimum wage the association said in its lawsuit Additional examples include reducing health coverage and charging for parking or workrelated equipment Inglewood voters approved the ordinance in November nearly a year before California legislators enacted a minimum wage for health workers Those statewide higher wages are to be phased in starting in June under Californias firstinthenation law but Gov Gavin Newsom has since said they are too expensive as the state faces a deficit estimated between billion and billion Its unclear if lawmakers will agree to a delay or take other steps to reduce the cost US District Judge Dale S Fischer agreed with the hospital industry in a March tentative ruling when he shot down the portion of Inglewoods ordinance banning layoffs and clawbacks by employers while allowing the rest of the ordinance to remain in effect He gave the sides time to object to his preliminary decision though none did EMAIL SIGNUp Subscribe to California Healthlines free Daily Edition Your Email Address Sign

wages,ADVERTISEMENT UPDATE The city posted this on wehoorg Tuesday The City Council voted to affirm the Citys Minimum Wage rate of per hour and current Leave Provisions through December The Council directed staff to return with an update to postpone the next annual CPI increase from July to January and increase every January thereafter West Hollywood City Council on Monday decided to delay the planned increase in the minimum wage scheduled to occur in July by six months a small concession to the citys business community which had rallied for changes to the citys divisive labor policies The decision falls far short of the requests made by the WeHo Chamber of Commerce which included a new model for tipped workers and rescinding paidtime off for parttime workers But the move is also likely to anger UNITE HERE Local and other labor organizations who helped coordinate the policys passage three years ago and have since been pushing for even higher increases in wages THE POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTS Laura Biery the Director of Economic Development summarized the progress and background of the minimum wage ordinance This ordinance approved on November initially set a minimum wage for hotel workers and included phased implementation for nonhotel businesses with additional leave provisions The council meeting addressed the financial challenges local businesses faced due to the new wage standards as evidenced by letters from businesses These businesses requested amendments to the ordinance and additional support which led to the council approving measures like fee waivers and marketing support totaling to drive business in West Hollywood ADVERTISEMENT Various updates were given including marketing efforts and surveys conducted among employees and employers to assess the ordinances impact The labor advocacy groups raised concerns about the complexity of implementing a twotiered system for compensated leave which might reduce worker protections The meeting also reviewed business tax certificates to provide data on new and closed businesses helping to illustrate the economic landscape in West Hollywood Updates on compensated leave provisions compared to other cities were discussed showing West Hollywoods unique approach to including paid vacation and personal necessity leave alongside sick leave West Hollywood has aligned its leave accrual rates with California state law requiring employers to provide an itemized breakdown of compensated leave hours on pay stubs for transparency Additionally the city encourages employers to follow West Hollywoods minimum wage rates even if they receive a waiver and mandates that waiver notices include specific dates Probolsky Research presented survey results from hourly workers in West Hollywood highlighting their demographic characteristics awareness of the minimum wage ordinance and overall sentiment about the citys direction The survey indicated that a significant majority were aware of the minimum wage law but fewer understood other benefits of the ordinance A substantial portion of hourly workers felt positively about the citys direction although there was room for improvement in compensation and benefits as highlighted by the workers The survey also revealed that most respondents live within miles of the city primarily drive alone to work and a significant number reported not receiving the mandated minimum wage Regarding additional earnings received tips and a small percentage earned commissions with these being crucial for their overall compensation The survey discussed the impact of the minimum wage ordinance with many reporting no significant change although the data suggests a nuanced effect on hourly workers financial and employment situations Questions from councilmembers focused on the details of the survey such as why the accrual rate for unpaid sick leave was adjusted and the extent to which respondents employment status parttime vs fulltime was considered in the survey The results prompted a broader discussion about the effectiveness of the ordinance potential improvements for future surveys and the specific needs of hourly workers in terms of policy adjustments FM provided a summary of survey results regarding the conditions for employers in West Hollywood focusing on their perceptions of the business climate and the impact of recent policy changes including the minimum wage ordinance Key findings from the survey included A diversity in the longevity of businesses operating in West Hollywood with some being newly established and others having been in business for over years About of businesses reported having employees paid only the minimum wage without additional compensation such as tips or bonuses Conversely stated their employees receive supplementary financial compensation Most businesses about twothirds operate only one location indicating a prevalence of nonchain local businesses in West Hollywood Employers general sentiment about the citys direction is mixed believe things are heading in the right direction feel they are on the wrong track and are unsure Regarding the business environment about expressed a favorable view of West Hollywood as a place to do business while a notable portion nearly rated it poorly Top concerns for businesses included managing homelessness slowing or stopping minimum wage increases and mandatory benefits and addressing public safety Awareness of the minimum wage was high at and were aware of the compensated and uncompensated leave policies The survey also explored the broader impacts on businesses from various issues with significant portions reporting negative effects particularly regarding recent policy changes PUBLIC COMMENTS Public comments during the meeting showed a deeply rooted concern among local business owners and community representatives regarding the minimum wage increases and associated benefits in West Hollywood Business owners particularly from the restaurant and bar sectors expressed significant distress over the financial implications of the minimum wage increases Carmen Bolas general manager of La Boheme highlighted the

industry These layoffs were not just a matter of reducing headcount but were seen as a last resort to sustain the business amidst rising labor costs The profitability of such establishments was noted to be under severe strain with margins as low as and instances where businesses operated at a loss Bolas emphasized the realworld consequences of wellintentioned wage policies which while designed to improve worker conditions have resulted in increased operational burdens on businesses already struggling to recover from the economic effects of the COVID pandemic Representatives from the West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and related entities voiced concerns over the broader impact on the communitys cultural and economic fabric They noted a significant decrease in customer visits and a general decline in the economic vibrancy that characterizes West Hollywood The area known for its dynamic nightlife and hospitality industry was described as becoming increasingly deserted a change attributed to the high cost of doing business which deters both new and existing establishments from flourishing or even maintaining stable operations Business representatives called for a more sustainable approach that balances the needs of workers with the realities of business operations They suggested that without such adjustments the local economy might face longerterm decline with fewer job opportunities and reduced community services as businesses close or move away Carlos Rubio representing Teamsters Local voiced strong opposition to amendments affecting the citys minimum wage and paid time off policies warning of negative repercussions for local standards particularly for parking attendants and potentially other sectors He linked the issue to broader social struggles exemplified by setbacks in LGBTQ rights in other regions Veronica Alvarado a hotel worker supported wage increases for hotel workers correlating her wage with her living conditions and the need for better pay to support her family including a child with autism Several other speakers including restaurant workers and hospitality organizers discussed the challenges faced by tipped and hourly workers in West Hollywood advocating for fair wages and working conditions to support the diverse community and prevent the city from losing its unique character due to economic pressures Kareem Amhurst and others expressed concern that diluting minimum wage and PTO policies could lead to greater economic inequality particularly harming backofhouse staff like kitchen and janitorial workers who rely heavily on these wages They suggested that rather than weakening worker protections efforts should focus on supporting businesses in ways that do not sacrifice worker compensation such as reducing commercial rents or other innovative measures COUNCILS DISCUSSION During discussion several councilmembers expressed views on the importance of educational outreach to ensure both employers and employees are wellinformed about their rights and obligations under these policies The councilmembers talked about potential adjustments to the PTO provisions to align more closely with other cities which generally offer less PTO than West Hollywood The citys leadership role in setting high standards for workers benefits was reaffirmed although the feasibility of a total compensation model that might include a tip credit was questioned due to legal uncertainties and potential noncompliance with state laws The council was advised that any major changes to wage policies would need thorough legal vetting and public notice before implementation Discussions also highlighted the need for continued advocacy at both the city and state levels to ensure that wage increases benefit the lowestpaid workers and did not lead to job losses or shifts in pay structures that could disadvantage them Councilmember Sepi Shyne addressed accusations of corruption specifically linked to campaign contributions made by UNITE HERE Local and the Chamber of Commerce Shyne aimed to clarify and refute claims suggesting that financial contributions from these organizations to councilmembers campaigns could influence council decisions in a corrupt manner UNITE HERE Local specifically had not given to any of the campaigns directly Shyne said OK the Chamber of Commerce also gives candidates funds so to say that certain votes are corrupt because they go one way or the other is misleading Every candidate is supported by people by unions by businesses by the chamber and just because a vote goes one way or the other doesnt necessarily mean theres corruption Thats how politics works thats how campaigns are funded Councilmember Lauren Meister excoriated City Halls approach to the research Im really concerned that with regard to the two surveys staff did not ask our researchers to draw conclusions and provide recommendations regarding the research Meister said Im just shocked that we have informationare you concerned that of employees said they were laid off from their previous job in West Hollywood That had their hours or shifts reduced and are making less money than before Are you concerned Im asking you this my question to you Do you know if thats a good number or a bad number It could be that being laid off is a great number or maybe its a horrible number we dont know and you are not telling us So for us to be sitting here trying to devise policies at at nightor even receive and fileand not having that information its just a waste of whatever you spent on that research Meister proposed hiring a consultant specialized in economic policy and employeremployee relations to address ongoing issues citing the divisiveness and operational challenges local businesses face due to frequent policy changes She recommended allowing new businesses a oneyear grace period to operate under state wage regulations to help them establish themselves before adhering to cityspecific regulations She called for her colleagues to reconsider the timing of planned Consumer Price Index CPI adjustments to give businesses more time to stabilize While previously expressing a willingness to revisit the policies Vice Mayor Chelsea Lee Byers had since had a change of heart In the ways I was interested in looking at that parttime provision change Im truly not anymore I really think we are doing something radical and transformational and necessary for the baseline of our workers Byers said The reasons arent just about the quality of life I do have fears that guardrails wont be insured for parttime workers We already know that people in West Hollywood choose West Hollywood because they get the hours they want here that may be less than hours and we cant accept that all fulltime employees are the only people who should get this sort of policy So thats a nogo for me I just want to say that clearly I dont believe in the total compensation package Byers continued I can go into my long list of reasons why after looking at this policy fuller but I dont believe its something that is going to be good for workers in the long run Mayor John M Erickson also defended the policies I was in this room in when the city council voted down the minimum wage Erickson recalled of his time prior to being elected I sat back there I couldnt believe what I saw And back then Im hearing the same exact thing Im hearing now too much too soon give us more time But back then minimum wage was an hour and now were talking at That was years ago and were still talking about this way that were keeping people to live in poverty Erickson said The idea that I think the policy conversation that were trying to have here is whats best forI think what we need to do to live in a city like West Hollywood and let me tell you its an hour and it probably needs to be higher than that THEIR DECISION Councilmember John Heilman summarized the key issues revolving around the conditions and rules for parttime employees consultation hiring and certain exemptions for new businesses with a focus on the scheduled Consumer Price Index CPI adjustment for minimum wage Heilman noted there was no majority support for changing the leave policies for parttime employees but said there was consensus that there needs to be more education regarding the existing ordinance on minimum wage and the associated benefits Meisters idea of querying the state labor department about the total compensation method allowed under the state labor code lacked support among the council A proposal for exempting new businesses from certain regulations for one year was discussed but the councils sentiment leaned towards not supporting this exemption The rationale was that new businesses should be aware of and able to comply with the existing wage laws upon entering the city In a vote Council agreed to delay the CPI increase used to adjust minimum wage from July to January st effectively postponing it for six months This would synchronize future adjustments to the start of the calendar year which could simplify administrative processes but requires revising the existing ordinance Shyne was the lone no vote This decision is to be formalized through an ordinance change to implement the CPI adjustment annually starting in January The council is set to vote on this motion and other items are to be received and filed indicating they will not proceed to further action at this time vote Article Rating,WeHo tosses businesses a bone month break from wage hikes WEHOonlinecom WEHOville ADVERTISEMENT UPDATE The city posted this on wehoorg Tuesday The City Council voted to affirm the Citys Minimum Wage rate of per hour and current Leave Provisions through December The Council directed staff to return with an update to postpone the next annual CPI increase from July to January and increase every January thereafter West Hollywood City Council on Monday decided to delay the planned increase in the minimum wage scheduled to occur in July by six months a small concession to the citys business community which had rallied for changes to the citys divisive labor policies The decision falls far short of the requests made by the WeHo Chamber of Commerce which included a new model for tipped workers and rescinding paidtime off for parttime workers But the move is also likely to anger UNITE HERE Local and other labor organizations who helped coordinate the policys passage three years ago and have since been pushing for even higher increases in wages THE POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTS Laura Biery the Director of Economic Development summarized the progress and background of the minimum wage ordinance This ordinance approved on November initially set a minimum wage for hotel workers and included phased implementation for nonhotel businesses with additional leave provisions The council meeting addressed the financial challenges local businesses faced due to the new wage standards as evidenced by letters from businesses These businesses requested amendments to the ordinance and additional support which led to the council approving measures like fee waivers and marketing support totaling to drive business in West Hollywood ADVERTISEMENT Various updates were given including marketing efforts and surveys conducted among employees and employers to assess the ordinances impact The labor advocacy groups raised concerns about the complexity of implementing a twotiered system for compensated leave which might reduce worker protections The meeting also reviewed business tax certificates to provide data on new and closed businesses helping to illustrate the economic landscape in West Hollywood Updates on compensated leave provisions compared to other cities were discussed showing West Hollywoods unique approach to including paid vacation and personal necessity leave alongside sick leave West Hollywood has aligned its leave accrual rates with California state law requiring employers to provide an itemized breakdown of compensated leave hours on pay stubs for transparency Additionally the city encourages employers to follow West Hollywoods minimum wage rates even if they receive a waiver and mandates that waiver notices include specific dates Probolsky Research presented survey results from hourly workers in West Hollywood highlighting their demographic characteristics awareness of the minimum wage ordinance and overall sentiment about the citys direction The survey indicated that a significant majority were aware of the minimum wage law but fewer understood other benefits of the ordinance A substantial portion of hourly workers felt positively about the citys direction although there was room for improvement in compensation and benefits as highlighted by the workers The survey also revealed that most respondents live within miles of the city primarily drive alone to work and a significant number reported not receiving the mandated minimum wage Regarding additional earnings received tips and a small percentage earned commissions with these being crucial for their overall compensation The survey discussed the impact of the minimum wage ordinance with many reporting no significant change although the data suggests a nuanced effect on hourly workers financial and employment situations Questions from councilmembers focused on the details of the survey such as why the accrual rate for unpaid sick leave was adjusted and the extent to which respondents employment status parttime vs fulltime was considered in the survey The results prompted a broader discussion about the effectiveness of the ordinance potential improvements for future surveys and the specific needs of hourly workers in terms of policy adjustments FM provided a summary of survey results regarding the conditions for employers in West Hollywood focusing on their perceptions of the business climate and the impact of recent policy changes including the minimum wage ordinance Key findings from the survey included A diversity in the longevity of businesses operating in West Hollywood with some being newly established and others having been in business for over years About of businesses reported having employees paid only the minimum wage without additional compensation such as tips or bonuses Conversely stated their employees receive supplementary financial compensation Most businesses about twothirds operate only one location indicating a prevalence of nonchain local businesses in West Hollywood Employers general sentiment about the citys direction is mixed believe things are heading in the right direction feel they are on the wrong track and are unsure Regarding the business environment about expressed a favorable view of West Hollywood as a place to do business while a notable portion nearly rated it poorly Top concerns for businesses included managing homelessness slowing or stopping minimum wage increases and mandatory benefits and addressing public safety Awareness of the minimum wage was high at and were aware of the compensated and uncompensated leave policies The survey also explored the broader impacts on businesses from various issues with significant portions reporting negative effects particularly regarding recent policy changes PUBLIC COMMENTS Public comments during the meeting showed a deeply rooted concern among local business owners and community representatives regarding the minimum wage increases and associated benefits in West Hollywood Business owners particularly from the restaurant and bar sectors expressed significant distress over the financial implications of the minimum wage increases Carmen Bolas general manager of La Boheme highlighted the detrimental impact on their operations including the necessity of laying off of their staffprimarily entrylevel workers and nonEnglish speakers who are often given opportunities to grow in the industry These layoffs were not just a matter of reducing headcount but were seen as a last resort to sustain the business amidst rising labor costs The profitability of such establishments was noted

Capital Chronicle,employment wages,Fridays jobs data showed a strong resilient US labor market with wages outpacing inflation welcome news for Americans hoping to have more purchasing power in The December jobs report unveiled another unemployment rate below as it has for two years at the same as it was for November The economy added jobs many of which were concentrated in health care local government construction and social assistance which includes child care social workers and home care aides according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data Democrats celebrated the news and took it as an opportunity to voice their frustrations with Republicans as policymakers grapple with another possible government shutdown over USMexico border policy and other issues Congress has deadlines of Jan for four government spending bills and Feb for eight government spending bills President Joe Biden stated on Friday morning that the jobs data confirms that was a great year for American workers The strong job creation continued even as inflation fell to the prepandemic level of percent over the last six months he added Rep Bobby Scott DVA ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce touted the strong jobs report and stated Now is not the time to reverse our progress on the economy I remain committed to opposing any effort that gambles with the lives of everyday Americans in order to engage in political grandstanding Economists and data analysts provided States Newsroom with their takeaways on key news in the report from wages to job growth in healthcare Wage growth and cooling inflation provide relief Wages are outpacing inflation with average hourly earnings increasing by cents and rising by over the past year well over inflation With inflation coming down fairly quickly wages are solidly above inflation economists said Moodys Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said wage growth is now firmly above the rate of inflation which means peoples real purchasing power is improving They got creamed back in and particularly in when inflation outpaced wages Zandi said And I think thats one reason why people are so uncomfortable with their financial position but thats improving now and improving very quickly as wage growth remains strong and firm and inflation is lower and continues to moderate Elise Gould senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute added that lower wage workers in particular have seen that increased purchasing power for longer For the last six months the average hourly earnings for private sector workers has been beating inflation so their purchasing power has increased and on average over the last few months we also know from other data that lower wage workers have been seeing stronger wage growth she said Theyve been beating inflation for a lot longer Overall the purchasing power has certainly been increasing as inflation has been coming down faster Health care and government continue to add jobs The government workforce grew by people with the majority of those jobs in local governments According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the average gains of jobs per month in was more than double the average for job growth in Gould said there still seems to be room for government employment to continue to grow We still have a lot of catching up to do there because when we think about government employment it has not kept up with population growth in any way she said You would think that the services that are being provided by the government would need to grow even more So I think theres a fair amount of room there that we are not back to normal in that sense Health care also continues to see job growth which Gould expects to continue partly because of the USs aging population Health care jobs rose by in December Ambulatory health care services and hospitals added jobs and jobs respectively Zandi sees these sectors as mostly playing catchup after the private sector crowded out some of these jobs during the recovery by offering higher pay Private businesses were willing to pay up big wage increases to hold on to workers and hire new ones he said And that was impossible for local governments or for hospitals to keep up with But now that the private sector is fully recovered were now starting to see these other sectors be able to hire again find workers and bring them on the payrolls Economists watch for signs of a slowdown Economists had mixed responses to the changes in the labor force participation rate and employmentpopulation ratio which both fell percentage point in December The labor force participation rate sheds light on the economy through the percentage of working age people in the labor force which includes both those actively seeking work and people who are currently employed The employmentpopulation ratio shows the number of people employed as part of the working age population Gould said shes watching this data closely to see whether these changes are a source for concern but she says its important to keep in mind that unemployment is still very low Is that just volatility in the series or is there something to watch for she said Its not indicative of some huge problem but its something we want to keep watching I didnt like the drop in employment particularly primeage employment and participation is soft Zandi said its hard to read too much into any monthtomonth change in this data yet but that the labor market is slowing down a bit I think the general pattern in the data shows that the job market is resilient continues to create lots of jobs and unemployment remains low But it is throttling back Job growth is definitively slowing and other measures of the strength of the labor market are are moderating Youre seeing fewer hours of work and temp employment is declining he said On the labor force participation rate Zandi said he suspects that participation is not going to continue to rise Boomers are retiring en masse and thats going to wash out any increase in participation by other groups Broadly speaking I think the report is consistent with an economy that remains strong but is slow and consistent with getting inflation back to something we all feel comfortable with he said Trends in state pay Data released by ADP a payroll processing firm on Thursday confirmed Zandis view on a cooling labor market as pay increases for people staying at their jobs were down in December from November ADPs median yearoveryear pay change was higher in states such as Montana where pay shot up and Idaho where pay rose New Mexico and Arizona also had higher increases in pay compared to many other states at and Washington Oregon Wyoming North Dakota and South Dakota also had pay growth over that time period Liv Wang lead data scientist at the ADP Research Institute told States Newsroom that ADP saw higher pay growth for lowerpaid workers during the recovery Wang added in an email some of the states with higher percentage increases in pay have lower median pay levels This is true for some states in both the Northwest and Southwest This same trend also applies to the Leisure and Hospitality industry which has been leading pay increases However more broadly pay gains have slowed down recently and the pay premium for changing jobs has been falling,December jobs report Wages up hiring steady as job

inflation which means peoples real purchasing power is improving They got creamed back in and particularly in when inflation outpaced wages Zandi said And I think thats one reason why people are so uncomfortable with their financial position but thats improving now and improving very quickly as wage growth remains strong and firm and inflation is lower and continues to moderate Elise Gould senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute added that lower wage workers in particular have seen that increased purchasing power for longer For the last six months the average hourly earnings for private sector workers has been beating inflation so their purchasing power has increased and on average over the last few months we also know from other data that lower wage workers have been seeing stronger wage growth she said Theyve been beating inflation for a lot longer Overall the purchasing power has certainly been increasing as inflation has been coming down faster Health care and government continue to add jobs The government workforce grew by people with the majority of those jobs in local governments According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the average gains of jobs per month in was more than double the average for job growth in Gould said there still seems to be room for government employment to continue to grow We still have a lot of catching up to do there because when we think about government employment it has not kept up with population growth in any way she said You would think that the services that are being provided by the government would need to grow even more So I think theres a fair amount of room there that we are not back to normal in that sense Health care also continues to see job growth which Gould expects to continue partly because of the USs aging population Health care jobs rose by in December Ambulatory health care services and hospitals added jobs and jobs respectively Zandi sees these sectors as mostly playing catchup after the private sector crowded out some of these jobs during the recovery by offering higher pay Private businesses were willing to pay up big wage increases to hold on to workers and hire new ones he said And that was impossible for local governments or for hospitals to keep up with But now that the private sector is fully recovered were now starting to see these other sectors be able to hire again find workers and bring them on the payrolls Economists watch for signs of a slowdown Economists had mixed responses to the changes in the labor force participation rate and employmentpopulation ratio which both fell percentage point in December The labor force participation rate sheds light on the economy through the percentage of working age people in the labor force which includes both those actively seeking work and people who are currently employed The employmentpopulation ratio shows the number of people employed as part of the working age population Gould said shes watching this data closely to see whether these changes are a source for concern but she says its important to keep in mind that unemployment is still very low Is that just volatility in the series or is there something to watch for she said Its not indicative of some huge problem but its something we want to keep watching I didnt like the drop in employment particularly primeage employment and participation is soft Zandi said its hard to read too much into any monthtomonth change in this data yet but that the labor market is slowing down a bit I think the general pattern in the data shows that the job market is resilient continues to create lots of jobs and unemployment remains low But it is throttling back Job growth is definitively slowing and other measures of the strength of the labor market are are moderating Youre seeing fewer hours of work and temp employment is declining he said On the labor force participation rate Zandi said he suspects that participation is not going to continue to rise Boomers are retiring en masse and thats going to wash out any increase in participation by other groups Broadly speaking I think the report is consistent with an economy that remains strong but is slow and consistent with getting inflation back to something we all feel comfortable with he said Trends in state pay Data released by ADP a payroll processing firm on Thursday confirmed Zandis view on a cooling labor market as pay increases for people staying at their jobs were down in December from November ADPs median yearoveryear pay change was higher in states such as Montana where pay shot up and Idaho where pay rose New Mexico and Arizona also had higher increases in pay compared to many other states at and Washington Oregon Wyoming North Dakota and South Dakota also had pay growth over that time period Liv Wang lead data scientist at the ADP Research Institute told States Newsroom that ADP saw higher pay growth for lowerpaid workers during the recovery Wang added in an email some of the states with higher percentage increases in pay have lower median pay levels This is true for some states in both the Northwest and Southwest This same trend also applies to the Leisure and Hospitality industry which has been leading pay increases However more broadly pay gains have slowed down recently and the pay premium for changing jobs has been falling

Credit is being brought in by the Department for Work and Pensions DWP next month affecting tens of thousands of people A big rise to the Administrative Earnings Threshold AET will start from May The minimum required wage levels for benefit claimants who have work requirements will go up to per calendar month for individuals and per calendar month for couples in Great Britain This is equivalent to an individual working hours per week at the National Living Wage or couples working a total of hours per week at the National Living Wage New regulations to raise the AET were laid following Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks speech on welfare reforms In the speech Mr Sunak said It used to be that if you worked just nine hours a week youd get full benefits without needing to look for additional work Thats not right Because if you can work more you should So were changing the rules Anyone working less than half a fulltime week will now have to try and find extra work in return for claiming benefits READ MORE Confirming the specifics of the new policy Minister for Employment Jo Churchill issued a statement that said This will raise the Administrative Earnings Threshold level delivering on a commitment made in the Spring Budget last year to per calendar month for individual customers and per calendar month for couples in Great Britain The new threshold levels would be equivalent to an individual working hours per week at the National Living Wage or couples working a total of hours per week at the National Living Wage This change will mean that the threshold will have doubled since September when it was first increased from the equivalent of nine hours for a single person Combined with previous increases this means more customers will have more intensive support from our Work Coaches to help them to progress in work and move off welfare This is why the Government has today laid regulations to amend Regulation of the Universal Credit Regulations to raise the Administrative Earnings Threshold level to for individual claimants and for couples in Great Britain from May This is all part of our welfare reforms to make work pay and is backed up by our billion Back to Work Plan which will help a million people find stay and succeed in employment The upcoming change will affect Universal Credit claimants Anyone earning below the AET is placed in an Intensive Work Search Group which means they must meet regularly with their work coach to find ways to boost their wages Theyll have to increase the hours in their current role find a second job or move to a betterpaid position elsewhere that meets the new requirements Otherwise they could be sanctioned and see their benefits cut or stopped until they comply with the rules From April the AET had gone up to for individuals and for couples so the new change will be the second increase in just over a month Anyone whose pay meets or exceeds the new levels wont have to take any action to boost their wages In his speech Mr Sunak had warned of the Government getting tougher on claimants He said One of my other big concerns about the system is that the longer you stay on welfare the harder it can be to go back to work More than people have been unemployed for months and well over a quarter of a million have been unemployed for months These are people with no medical conditions that prevent them from working and who will have benefited from intensive employment support and training programmes There is no reason those people should not be in work especially when we have almost million job vacancies So we will now look at options to strengthen our regime Anyone who doesnt comply with the conditions set by their Work Coach such as accepting an available job will after months have their claim

everything is awesome and Democratic voters say everything is terrible and vice versa even if they dont really change their spending The reason we think its puzzling why people are unhappy now is because the evidence that a full employment economy makes people happy is overwhelming said Justin Wolfers an economist at the University of Michigan Right now people are frustrated by inflation that while cooling is still higher than it has been in many peoples lifetimes and theyre still missing prices Consumers and businesses are dealing with higher interest rates that have come as a result of the Federal Reserves attempt to tame inflation meaning items such as mortgages and car loans are more expensive All of the noise coming from that can drown out the positive aspects of the economy including the labor market which not everyone experiences uniformly There is a recognition that a strong labor market is great for workers but not necessarily good for businesses Full employment is so good for the economy It raises wages it brings people into the labor force who have been traditionally left behind it is an extremely equalizing force said Bharat Ramamurti former deputy director of the National Economic Council But that equalizing force might be part of the perception problem I think a lot of people respond to that negatively because theyre on the other side of that equation Related The problem isnt inflation Its prices This type of labor market means that businesses big and small have to compete more for workers which they dont love and complain about loudly In turn it means consumers might have to wait more or have a worse time at a restaurant cafe or hotel because staffing just isnt what it used to be That latte isnt only pricier but it takes longer and customers

its so hard to find good help these days that means better pay for their employees though it also sometimes means shorter staffing The public hears the former voice more often and louder than it does latter There is a recognition that a strong labor market is great for workers but not necessarily good for businesses said Joanne Hsu who runs consumer surveys for the University of Michigans

hearing more negative news about employment than they did in the mid to late s A surprising share of consumers are mentioning labor markets as a topic of negative news about the economy Hsu said Why do people feel like this A lot of it is perception It may be the case that people should say they feel better about the economy than they do but nobody can tell anybody how to feel about things or say the reality theyre living isnt well real As to why full employment isnt breaking through sentimentwise there are likely a number of factors in play Partisanship and negative media bias play a role Republicans arent going to say things are good when Joe Biden is in office and apparently Democrats have their own qualms too Whether Democrats are actually mad about the economy or just nonplussed by Biden is an open question The media tells stories through the lens of business owners CEOs and investors all of whom are less likely to love how hard it is to find workers stories about the workers who are benefiting tend to be less plentiful Layoffs make headlines especially when theyre at big names in media and tech and even when theyre a teeny tiny sliver of the labor market Social media often thrives on negative content Making it in America today doesnt feel very made Inflation is of course painful and an enormous mood dampener Its not clear how much higher wages have played into higher prices the answer appears to be likely not very much Still consumers worry that higher pay for workers and organized labor making more demands could lead to higher prices on items ranging from their cars to their ChickfilA sandwiches Inflation also feels like a thing happening to people outside of their control When things go well for people at work when they get promotions and raises they often attribute it to their unique circumstances and talents not macroeconomic conditions In a robust labor market like this one many people feel secure about their jobs and confident about their prospects At the same time theyre seeing businesses scrounging around for employees They cant get a plumber to come fix their sink their favorite restaurant has shorter hours or their local vet clinic has completely shut down When you run into that then you see the downside of the tight labor market and I think this is particularly acute because people with jobs which is most people who want jobs right now have money to spend and they cant always spend it in the ways that they want Hsu said Even good news can be spun into bad news Given the strength of the current labor market its fair to think things should feel better Many people though not everyone are making quite a bit more than they were four years ago It can feel almost more frustrating that your job is finally paying you well youre in the spot you wanted to be in and you still cant afford things easily Gas and groceries remain a pain You finally got to take that vacation but it was more than you expected to pay and the

Labor Market Models Paint an Incomplete Picture by Suresh Naidu - International Monetary Fund,Labor Market Models Paint an Incomplete Picture by Suresh Naidu  International Monetary Fund,"Mon, 04 Mar

Monetary Fund,employment wages,min words Read Download PDF The traditional economic model of how wages are set fails to reflect the real world In the standard model of the labor market taught in introductory economics classes around the world there is nothing special about the relationship between employer and employee Instead the model simply relabels the canonical supplyanddemand diagram magically transforming price floors into minimum wages and unions into monopolists The labor market is governed by the same forces of supply and demand as are refrigerators or carrots according to the model Because labor market institutions and norms impede these forces the model considers them merely obstacles to efficiency This perfectly competitive view of the labor market is not entirely wrong But it is incompleteand has pushed economicpolicy thinking to focus on demand and supply as the only things that matter for labor market outcomes It presumes that the law of one pricewhich postulates that identical commodities have the same price everywhereincludes workers and their wages As a result the model considers the supply of human capital and technologyinduced demand as the sole levers that move labor markets with little role for firms norms or interventionist institutions such as labor unions and governments The perfect competition model generally portrays efforts to shape the terms of voluntary contracts between workers and firms like union negotiations or minimum wages as either of secondary importance at best or counterproductive at worst As the late Milton Friedman wrote The employee is protected from being coerced by his employer by the existence of other employers for whom he can work But the empirical implications of the theory do not much match up with the real world For example in the hypothetical case of a company reducing wages by percent the perfect competition model predicts that all workers eventually will quit and go to competitors Firms have no scope for wage setting and the market determines a workers value at every firm A dose of reality But experimental and quasiexperimental estimates in relatively unregulated scenarios all suggest that is not what happens The number of workers who leave in response to a wage cut is much smaller perhaps to percentand in developing economies lower still This suggests that employers have wide latitude to set wages A higher wage does help recruit and retain workers but the market does not seriously constrain companies wage decisions and different employers can make different choices That is employers exercise monopsony powerthe labor market analog of demandside monopoly power that gives sellers a degree of control over pricing Dissatisfaction with the traditional depiction of the labor market is not new The oldest criticisms of this modelfor example that it does not predict involuntary unemploymentremain true And new ones have emergedsuch as the importance of firms market power and cultural norms Nevertheless despite a large collection of theories and evidence from the s that poked holes in the model the traditional framework remains the default model for pedagogy and economic policymaking Prior to CORE Econ Curriculum Openaccess Resources in Economicsan opensource economics textbook project I am involved inthe model of the labor market in introductory textbooks was some version of supply and demand Various other economic forces are acknowledged as possible deviations from the basic model but the model has not changed As a result for example there is pervasive bias in US employment law that both firms and workers can readily terminate an employment relationship at low cost Cracks in the edifice Much of the current criticism of the traditional labor market model stems from increasingly wide empirical cracks in the economic paradigm Although the basic model postulates that firms do not matter much because all workers doing the same kind of job should get the same market wage it is clear that employer behavior is responsible for a significant share of wages Early th century labor economists had marshaled some evidence on this point but the advent of highquality matched employeremployee data combined with transparent quasiexperiments has moved the research frontier considerably There is a large body of evidence showing some firmspecific wages that reflect in part the productivity and profitability of their employers which conflicts with the law of one price It is remarkably difficult to find negative effects of a minimum wage on employment although the perfectly competitive model predicts that a minimum wage increase would make the least productive workers expendable with no countervailing effects on turnover or effort There is robust evidence to suggest that labor market concentration is negatively correlated with wages and that mergers of large employers lower wages Moreover there is more recent evidence that unions and minimum wages mitigate the negative effect of concentration on wages Most directly quasiexperimental changes in wages across workers all else equal lead to only moderate changes in quits and recruits All this evidence points toward pervasive monopsony as a force in the labor market where firms set wages for groups of workers losing those who have better outside options but making profits off those who do not While monopsony is but one thread in a web of forces that make the labor market messier than the supplyanddemand model it is readily seized on to explain aberrations in the labor market because it is both empirically quantifiable from readily available data and conceptually not too far away from the safe space of Economics Simply relaxing the assumption that firms take market wages as given already yields a much more plausible view of the labor market Job searches are difficult Large firms set wages for a whole set of jobs without having to compete with themselves which creates a bubble of noncompetitive behavior within a workplace Employees find searching for jobs costly and many vacancies and possible matches are communicated only informally through social networks Evidence shows that workers have relatively little credible information on jobs outside their firms Jger and others A major reason that labor market monopsony exists is that jobs are more than sources of income and employees factor in more than compensation when making job choices Among other things jobs also offer social experiences and status and sometimes confer identity Many aspects of a job matterincluding relationships with coworkers and supervisors commute times tastes and abilities for particular tasks scheduling and hours People value work they think others think is valuable Subjective experiences of worksuch as meaning and sense of purpose managerial respect and the experience of dignityare important to workers The taste for the same job and knowledge about outside jobs vary among workers which gives employers some scope to reduce wages losing some workers who would rather work elsewhere but keeping those for whom the job is the best they could hope to find Collective and sectoral wage bargaining between employers and democratic unions has the potential to improve efficiency fairness and the balance of power in the labor market Antitrust policy is one area that has focused on monopsony in labor markets Although traditional antitrust analysis is concerned mainly with consumer welfare recent legal and economic research highlights the role of employer market power There are cases under active investigation by antitrust authorities in the United States and recent horizontal merger guidelines for combinations of companies in the same industry suggest that mergers should be screened for harm to workers Further antitrust authorities have pursued restrictions on noncompete clauses which limit an employees ability to work for a competitor and nopoaching agreements in which companies agree not to solicit each others employees Both are horizontal same industry restraints that putatively dampen labor market competition Wagesetting power But Naidu and Posner argue that antitrust is only part of the solution to monopsony because much of a firms monopsony power is intrinsic to labor as a commodity and not the product of artificial constraints or undue concentration By any measure labor supply does not exhaust the constraints on firms wagesetting decisions And monopsony is only part of the wagesetting calculation for firms For example just because employers have market power doesnt mean they use it all There are many countervailing constraintsinternal ones such as the need to motivate workers to exert effort and care management interests in empire building rather than simple cost minimization norms of fairness and reciprocityand those that are external such as patterned wage setting when firms emulate each others wages minimum wages and unions Although monopsony alone emphasizes getting bodies into the workplace older literature on efficiency wages those set higher than minimum to keep a desirable workforce stressed the behavior of people once they are at work A monopsonist that also wants effort must restrain its wagesetting power Much research in personnel economics has examined the design of jobs teams and incentives inside a firm But little of this literature has considered how these interact with the diversity of outside options for workers who have identical productivitya scenario that is stressed by monopsony analysis For example Dube Giuliano and Leonard find that large quit rates in response to discontinuity in wage policy are driven by aversion to unfair and arbitrary changes in wages It is not even clear that firms are perfectly optimizing their profits The textbook model suggests that firms set wages to maximize profits But if optimizing is difficult for managers to accomplish monopsony gives firms some slack to make mistakes Dube Manning and Naidu document pervasive roundnumber bunching in administrative data in which the most commonly occurring nominal hourly wage is a remarkable over a long period of time They also show that bunching is not the result of workers being fooled into thinking round numbers are artificially high it occurs because employers fail to set wages with an eye to precise maximization of profits This finding is consistent with recent research documenting widespread uniform wage settingnational employers setting countrywide minimum wages regardless of local labor market conditions or multinationals propagating homecountry minimum wages to their locations around the world When employers have labor market power they do not need to engage in a costly search for a perfectly profitmaximizing wage employers can afford to over or underpay workers because they do not lose a lot of profit But when managersfor example those with MBAsdo in fact focus on profit maximization wages are lower and turnover higher Acemoglu He and le Maire One thing employer wage setting makes clear is that power is exercised in the labor market either through monopsony power over wages or through the threat of unemployment A laissezfaire labor market implicitly allocates wagesetting power to employers The history of government regulation of the labor market is marked by an understanding that in the interest of workers there should be some countervailing force against this power But some efforts to regulate labor markets wind up allocating more power to an unaccountable regulator or to a possibly undemocratic union than to workers And even wellintentioned but mistargeted reforms can create conditions in which unemployed workers line up for jobs and remain vulnerable to being excluded from employment Blunt instrument For example while the minimum wage is a popular antidote to monopsony power it is a blunt instrument able to target only wages at the bottom of the distribution When minimum wages are imposed or raised the number of lowproductivity jobs may shrink but labor market monopsony implies that highproductivity jobs will expand and the overall effect on employment will theoretically be indeterminate But labor market standards set from afar by a regulator that does not consider the interests of affected workers are more likely to be too high or too low fail to account for specific nonwage amenities employees value and be unable to target the monopsony of higherproductivity firms in the same labor market Recent evidence suggests that in the United States on balance minimum wages have not been set too high There is renewed interest in the labor movement Collective and sectoral wage bargaining between employers and democratic unions has the potential to improve efficiency fairness and the balance of power in the labor market Workplace unions and worker representatives have private information about both the constraints facing their employers and the nonwage amenities valued by their workers When backed by the bargaining power of a larger union federation or a government mandate effective worker representation could offset employer power in ways attuned to local labor market and workplace conditions Recent research suggests that at least in Europe increased worker representation has few observable adverse consequences Perhaps to the frustration of many managers worker representation also imposes governance structures on the workplacesuch as regulating childcare parental leave remote work scheduling promotions and health and safety conditions But this is a consequence of unionized labor markets that alter the allocation of power between employers and workers How this plays out in practice will depend on the inclusiveness and accountability of union governance Increased worker representation does however open the way for more democratic and efficient workplaces than the laissezfaire employerdominated

The traditional economic model of how wages are set fails to reflect the real world In the standard model of the labor market taught in introductory economics classes around the world there is nothing special about the relationship between employer and employee Instead the model simply relabels the canonical supplyanddemand diagram magically transforming price floors into minimum wages and unions into monopolists The labor market is governed by the same forces of supply and demand as are refrigerators or carrots according to the model Because labor market institutions and norms impede these forces the model considers them merely obstacles to efficiency This perfectly competitive view of the labor market is not entirely wrong But it is incompleteand has pushed economicpolicy thinking to focus on demand and supply as the only things that matter for labor market outcomes It presumes that the law of one pricewhich postulates that identical commodities have the same price everywhereincludes workers and their wages As a result the model considers the supply of human capital and technologyinduced demand as the sole levers that move labor markets with little role for firms norms or interventionist institutions such as labor unions and governments The perfect competition model generally portrays efforts to shape the terms of voluntary contracts between workers and firms like union negotiations or minimum wages as either of secondary importance at best or counterproductive at worst As the late Milton Friedman wrote The employee is protected from being coerced by his employer by the existence of other employers for whom he can work But the empirical implications of the theory do not much match up with the real world For example in the hypothetical case of a company reducing wages by percent the perfect competition model predicts that all workers eventually will quit and go to competitors Firms have no scope for wage setting and the market determines a workers value at every firm A dose of reality But experimental and quasiexperimental estimates in relatively unregulated scenarios all suggest that is not what happens The number of workers who leave in response to a wage cut is much smaller perhaps to percentand in developing economies lower still This suggests that employers have wide latitude to set wages A higher wage does help recruit and retain workers but the market does not seriously constrain companies wage decisions and different employers can make different choices That is employers exercise monopsony powerthe labor market analog of demandside monopoly power that gives sellers a degree of control over pricing Dissatisfaction with the traditional depiction of the labor market is not new The oldest criticisms of this modelfor example that it does not predict involuntary unemploymentremain true And new ones have emergedsuch as the importance of firms market power and cultural norms Nevertheless despite a large collection of theories and evidence from the s that poked holes in the model the traditional framework remains the default model for pedagogy and economic policymaking Prior to CORE Econ Curriculum Openaccess Resources in Economicsan opensource economics textbook project I am involved inthe model of the labor market in introductory textbooks was some version of supply and demand Various other economic forces are acknowledged as possible deviations from the basic model but the model has not changed As a result for example there is pervasive bias in US employment law that both firms and workers can readily terminate an employment relationship at low cost Cracks in the edifice Much of the current criticism of the traditional labor market model stems from increasingly wide empirical cracks in the economic paradigm Although the basic model postulates that firms do not matter much because all workers doing the same kind of job should get the same market wage it is clear that employer behavior is

in the clip Watters claims that an hour is the average salary for fastfood workers In reality the average salary for a fastfood worker in the US can be anywhere from to per hour The wage depends on what state youre in what kind of experience you have and what position youre working ADVERTISEMENT Fastfood industry workers have been fighting for an industrywide pay floor for a long time In in the campaign Fight for fastfood workers advocated for a minimum wage of per hour And it was somewhat successful six states and many cities among which were San Francisco New York City and Seattle implemented laws that secured the minimum wage for fastfood workers On April st this year a minimum wage law took effect in California From then on the minimum salary for fastfood workers in the state is an hour The cochair of the Labor Center at the University of California Berkeley Ken Jacobs told ABC News that this is now the new benchmark We went through the Fight for and now is out there as a new target wage In contrast the minimum wage for all other workers in California is an hour Experts worry that this win for fastfood workers might have a spillover effect Wanting to retain their workers other employers might have to raise their wages as well Anyone in California making less than the new minimum wage in fast food will say Hey I can get a job at Wendys McDonalds or Taco Bell and make more money Jacobs explained However the law is only good news for some Nonfastfood franchise owners fear they wont be able to keep up and will face workforce shortages An owner of Auntie

customers can drive you crazy and the constant standing can be pretty taxing on your feet After all working at a fastfood restaurant comes with many physical demands as its a highpaced environment Customers come and go and queues form pretty quickly so employees have to be quick and on their feet Indeed warns those who are looking to start working in fastfood restaurants that theyll need to

In in the campaign Fight for fastfood workers advocated for a minimum wage of per hour And it was somewhat successful six states and many cities among which were San Francisco New York City and Seattle implemented laws that secured the minimum wage for fastfood workers On April st this year a minimum wage law took effect in California From then on the minimum salary for fastfood workers in the state is an hour The cochair of the Labor Center at the University of California Berkeley Ken Jacobs told ABC News that this is now the new benchmark We went through the Fight for and now is out there as a new target wage In contrast the minimum wage for all other workers in California is an hour Experts worry that this win for fastfood workers might have a spillover effect Wanting to retain their workers other employers might have to raise their wages as well Anyone in California making less than the new minimum wage in fast food will say Hey I can get a job at Wendys McDonalds or Taco Bell and make more money Jacobs explained However the law is only good news for some Nonfastfood franchise owners fear they wont be able to keep up and will face workforce shortages An owner of Auntie Annes Pretzels and Cinnabon restaurants Alex Johnson told AP News how he already had to lay off some staff from his office I try to do right by my employees I pay them as much as I can But this law is really hitting our operations hard he said ADVERTISEMENT Share icon Image credits Visual Karsa not the actual photo There is still a lot of stigma around fastfood work Another remark from Watters that people called out was when he implied that fastfood workers make too much money That job really doesnt require much he said Thats crazy referring to the fact that a fastfood worker might be making a year According to Watters Its inflating the labor sector Why is it that we look down on fastfood workers this much The work is certainly less than glamorous The pay is low dealing with difficult customers can drive you crazy and the constant standing can be pretty taxing on your feet After all working at a fastfood restaurant comes with many physical demands as its a highpaced environment Customers come and go and queues form pretty quickly so employees have to be quick and on their feet Indeed warns those who are looking to start working in fastfood restaurants that theyll need to make sure to eat and hydrate throughout the day and use their breaks to rest their feet and stretch Not to mention entitled and rude customers who always think they know better Social media is full of instances where fastfood workers get disrespected In one man got called a Slow a and a picture of a tired Popeyes worker was deemed funny and sparked countless memes In another video a person took advantage of the situation when a worker passed out in the kitchen ADVERTISEMENT One McDonalds employee wrote about her experience explaining how sometimes shes ashamed to admit that working in a fastfood restaurant is her anchor job Our country supposedly values hard work but somehow making an honest living even if in service work has become ridiculed the worker Adriana GomezWeston observed During the pandemic fastfood restaurant workers were among other essential employees who had to keep going to work amid the coronavirus outbreak Millions of people everyday use their services because its an affordable and speedy way to eat Doesnt that warrant at least some respect ADVERTISEMENT Share icon Image credits Vanna Phon not the actual photo People in the comments didnt hold back the

mechanization contributed to rising agricultural productivity reducing the need for labor Since employment levels have stabilized The reduction in selfemployed and family labor through was more rapid than the decline in hired labor According to data from the Farm Labor Survey FLS of USDAs National Agricultural Statistical Service NASS the number of selfemployed and family farmworkers declined from million in to million in a percent reduction Over this same period average annual employment of hired farmworkersincluding onfarm support personnel and those who work for farm labor contractorsdeclined from million to million a percent reduction As a result the proportion of hired workers has increased over time The rest of this page describes the employment earnings demographic characteristics and other information for the hired farm labor force only Information on the wellbeing of the selfemployed farmers and their families may be found on the ERS topic page on Farm Household Wellbeing Hired farmworkers make up less than percent of all US wage and salary workers but they play an essential role in US agriculture According to data from the Census of Agriculture wages and salaries plus contract labor costs represented just percent of production expenses for all farms but percent for greenhouse and nursery operations and percent for fruit and tree nut operations Hired farmworkers are found in a variety of occupations including field crop workers nursery workers livestock workers graders and sorters agricultural inspectors supervisors and hired farm managers The majority are wage and salary workers hired directly by farmers but some are employees of agricultural service companies including farm labor contractors custom harvest providers and management service providers Many industrywide employment estimates also include support personnel on farms such as human resource managers sales agents and truck drivers Many hired farmworkers are foreignborn people from Mexico and countries in Central America with many lacking authorization to work legally in the United States In recent years farmworkers have become more settled fewer migrating long distances from home to work and fewer pursuing seasonal followthecrop migration The number of young recent immigrants working in agriculture has also fallen and as a result the farm workforce is aging Over the past years wages for hired farmworkers have gradually risen both in real terms and in relation to wages for the average nonsupervisory worker in a nonfarm occupation Hired farmworkers are employed in both metro urban and nonmetro rural counties The statistics presented here refer to farmworkers nationwide unless otherwise indicated Recent Trends in the Employment of Hired Farmworkers According to data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages QCEW wage and salary employment in agriculture measured as the annual average number of full and parttime jobsincluding support industries such as farm labor contractingstabilized in the s and has been on a gradual upward trend since rising from million in to million in a gain of percent From employment increases were highest in crop support services which added jobs a percent increase and the livestock sector which added jobs a percent increase It should be noted that the QCEW is based on unemployment insurance records not on surveys of farms or households As a result it does not cover smaller farm employers in those States that exempt such employers from participation in the unemployment insurance system However survey data sources such as the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey also find rising farm employment since the turn of the century Demographic Characteristics of Hired Farmworkers Demographic information on farmworkers can be found in the American Community Survey ACS from the US Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census These data also allow us to distinguish among manual laborers managerssupervisors and other occupations in the industry Farm laborers have lower levels of educational attainment are slightly younger than US private wage and salary workers are more likely to be Hispanic of Mexican origin and are less likely to be citizens than both workers in other occupations in agriculture and the US wage and salary workforce as a whole Demographic characteristics of US hired farmworkers and all wage and salary workers Item Farm laborers graders and sorters Farm managers inspectors and supervisors All other occupations in agriculture Agriculture All occupations All US private wage and salary workers Percent female Average age in years Percent under age Percent over age Percent married RaceEthnicityAncestry Percent White not Hispanic Percent Black not Hispanic Percent other not Hispanic Percent Hispanic Mexican origin Percent Hispanic Other Percent born in US includes Puerto Rico Percent US citizens Education Percent lacking high school diploma Percent with high school diploma includes equivalency Percent with at least some college Note Counts all private sector wage and salary workers employed in the crop livestock and agricultural support industries Source USDA Economic Research Service analysis of data from US Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census American Community Survey Differences in demographics are also evident between crop and livestock workers not shown in table A larger share of laborers in crops and related support industries are female percent versus percent in livestock Crop laborers are also less likely to be nonHispanic White percent versus percent for livestock and less likely to have been born in the United States percent for crop workers in manual labor occupations versus percent for manual livestock workers Finally crop laborers have lower levels of educational attainment percent lack a high school degree compared with percent in livestock Notably the US Department of Labors National Agricultural Workers Survey NAWS discussed below finds larger shares of foreignborn Hispanic and lesseducated employees among crop and support workers than does the ACS livestock workers are not surveyed in NAWS For example according to NAWS estimates from data spanning fiscal years just percent of crop farm workers in manual labor occupations were US born compared with percent in the ACS The Hired Farm Workforce Is Aging As fewer young immigrants are entering agriculture the average age of foreignborn farmworkers has risen pulling up the average for the farm workforce as a whole The average age of immigrant farmworkers rose by years between and In contrast the average age for USborn farmworkers has remained roughly constant over this period Women Are an Increasing Share of the Hired Farm Workforce The share of farmworkers who are women declined in from percent to percent but has since climbed to percent in The fact that the female share fell during the Great Recession and has risen during the recovery is consistent with men moving into agriculture as employment in the nonfarm economy declines and out of agriculture as nonfarm job prospects improve The rising female share is also consistent with the fact that as labor costs rise some growers are adopting mechanical aids such as hydraulic platforms that replace ladders in treefruit harvesting and mobile conveyor belts that reduce the distance heavy loads must be carried which facilitate more women and older workers in performing tasks that traditionally have been performed by younger men Geographic Distribution of Hired Farmworkers By Place of Residence According to the American Community Survey percent of hired farmworkers reside in counties that are defined as metro urban This largely reflects the fact that most of the main farming areas in California Arizona and other Western States lie in large counties that also include major cities and thus are defined as metropolitan Wages of Hired Farmworkers According to data from the FLS real inflationadjusted wages for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers excluding contract labor rose at an average annual rate of percent per year between and In the past years however real farm wages grew at percent per year consistent with growers reports that workers were harder than usual to find In the average real farm wage for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers was just over half the average real wage in the nonfarm economy for privatesector nonsupervisory occupations versus in dollars By the farm wage was equal to percent of the nonfarm wage In other words the gap between farm and nonfarm wages is slowly shrinking but still substantial Wages for nonsupervisory occupations varied little across occupations ranging from for graders and sorters and for farmworkers in the livestock sector to for equipment operators For five out the six nonsupervisory occupations however wages were more than percent higher in than in not adjusted for inflation Average hourly wages for hired agricultural managers stood at in up percent from the year before Supervisors averaged per hour up percent Average wages by occupation Occupation SOC code Employment share percent Average hourly wage Nominal wage growth percent change Graders and sorters agricultural products

farmworkers Farmers ranchers and agricultural managers Firstline supervisors Subtotal supervisory and nonsupervisory occupations All other farm occupations All farm occupations Note SOC Standard Occupational Classification SOC Components may not sum to percent because of independent rounding Source USDA Economic Research Service using data from USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Farm Labor Survey As of the survey no longer counts contracted agricultural service workers Labor Cost Share of Total Gross Revenues Although farm wages are rising in nominal and real terms the impact of these rising costs on farmers incomes has been offset by rising productivity andor output prices As a result labor costs as a share of gross cash income do not show an upward trend for the industry as a whole over the past years For all farms labor costs including contract labor and cash fringe benefit costs averaged percent of gross cash income during compared with percent during However these trends in labor cost shares differ by commodity Labor cost shares have fallen slightly over the past years for the more laborintensive fruit and vegetable sectors although they appear to have been trending upwards again in the past few years On dairies and in nursery operations both of which also rely heavily on immigrant labor labor costs as a share of income are at or near their year highs HA Temporary Agricultural Program The HA Temporary Agricultural Programoften called the HA visa programprovides a legal means to bring foreignborn workers to the United States to perform seasonal farm labor on a temporary basis for a period of up to months Crop farmers can use this program to meet their seasonal labor needs but most livestock producers such as ranches dairies and hog and poultry operations are not legally allowed to use the program to meet yearround labor needs An exception to this restriction is made for producers of livestock on the range such as sheep and goat operations who can use HA workers yearround Employers in the HA program must demonstrate and the US Department of Labor must certify that efforts to recruit US workers were not successful Employers must also pay a Statespecific minimum wage which may not be lower than the average wage for crop and livestock workers surveyed in the FLS in that region in the prior year known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate AEWR See the next section for details on the AEWR In addition employers must provide housing for their HA workers and pay for their domestic and international transportation One of the clearest indicators of the scarcity of farm labor is the fact that the number of HA positions requested and approved has increased more than sevenfold in the past years from just over positions certified in fiscal to around in fiscal year The average duration of an HA certification in fiscal was months implying that the positions certified represented around fullyear equivalents A certified job does not necessarily result in the issuance of a visa in fact in recent years only about percent of jobs certified as HA have resulted in visas Around visas were issued in fiscal by the Department of State Adverse Effect Wage Rate HA employers must provide transportation and housing and pay the higher of the applicable State or federal minimum wage the prevailing wage in that region and occupation as determined by the US Department of Labor or the regional average farm wage observed in the NASS FLS The latter is known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate AEWR reflecting the legal requirement that HA employment should not negatively affect domestic farmworkers by lowering the average wage For fiscal this minimum hourly wage ranged from in Alabama Arkansas Georgia Louisiana Mississippi and South Carolina to in California and in the District of Columbia Legal Status and Migration Practices of Hired Crop Farmworkers Legal immigration status is difficult to measure not many surveys ask the question and unauthorized respondents may be reluctant to answer truthfully if asked The US Department of Labors National Agricultural Workers Survey NAWS provides data on farmworkers legal immigration status NAWS data believed to be of high quality is gathered by trained and trusted enumerators who conduct facetoface interviews with workers at their job sites and with their employers permission NAWS also queries workers on their inter and intranational migration patterns One limitation of the NAWS however is that it excludes the growing number of HA workers as well as all hired livestock workers Roughly Half of Hired Crop Farmworkers Lack Legal Immigration Status The share of hired crop farmworkers who were not legally authorized to work in the United States grew from roughly percent in to almost percent in in recent years it has declined to about percent In percent of crop farmworkers were US born percent were immigrants who had obtained US citizenship percent were other authorized immigrants primarily permanent residents or greencard holders and the remaining percent held no work authorization The share of workers who are US born is highest in the Midwest while the share who are unauthorized is highest in California More Farmworkers Are Settled Fewer Are Migrants Around percent of hired crop farmworkers are not migrant workers but are considered settled meaning that they work at a single location within miles of their home This share is up from percent in reflecting a profound change in the nature of the crop farm workforce Among the small share of remaining migrant workers the largest group is shuttlers who work at a single farm location more than miles from home and may cross an international border to get to their worksite Shuttlers made up about percent of hired crop farmworkers in down from about percent in More common in the past the follow the crop migrant farmworker who moves from State to State working on different crops as the seasons advance is now a relative rarity These workers made up just percent of those surveyed by the NAWS in down from a high of percent in The final category of hired crop farmworkers is newcomers to farming whose migration patterns have not yet been established The fact that they now represent just percent of the crop farm workforce down from as much as percent in in part reflecting the slowdown in net migration from Mexico to the United States since Links to Key Data Sources From the US Department of Agriculture Farm Labor Survey The Farm Labor Survey FLS conducted by USDAs National Agricultural Statistics Service NASS is based on semiannual phone interviews with a random sample of farm employers crops and livestock who are asked to provide quarterly data on their wage

private wage and salary workers are more likely to be Hispanic of Mexican origin and are less likely to be citizens than both workers in other occupations in agriculture and the US wage and salary workforce as a whole Demographic characteristics of US hired farmworkers and all wage and salary workers Item Farm laborers graders and sorters Farm managers inspectors and supervisors All other occupations in agriculture Agriculture All occupations All US private wage and salary workers Percent female Average age in years Percent under age Percent over age Percent married RaceEthnicityAncestry Percent White not Hispanic Percent Black not Hispanic Percent other not Hispanic Percent Hispanic Mexican origin Percent Hispanic Other Percent born in US includes Puerto Rico Percent US citizens Education Percent lacking high school diploma Percent with high school diploma includes equivalency Percent with at least some college Note Counts all private sector wage and salary workers employed in the crop livestock and agricultural support industries Source USDA Economic Research Service analysis of data from US Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census American Community Survey Differences in demographics are also evident between crop and livestock workers not shown in table A larger share of laborers in crops and related support industries are female percent versus percent in livestock Crop laborers are also less likely to be nonHispanic White percent versus percent for livestock and less likely to have been born in the United States percent for crop workers in manual labor occupations versus percent for manual livestock workers Finally crop laborers have lower levels of educational attainment percent lack a high school degree compared with percent in livestock Notably the US Department of Labors National Agricultural Workers Survey NAWS discussed below finds larger shares of foreignborn Hispanic and lesseducated employees among crop and support workers than does the ACS livestock workers are not surveyed in NAWS For example according to NAWS estimates from data spanning fiscal years just percent of crop farm workers in manual labor occupations were US born compared with percent in the ACS The Hired Farm Workforce Is Aging As fewer young immigrants are entering agriculture the average age of foreignborn farmworkers has risen pulling up the average for the farm workforce as a whole The average age of immigrant farmworkers rose by years between and In contrast the average age for USborn farmworkers has remained roughly constant over this period Women Are an Increasing Share of the Hired Farm Workforce The share of farmworkers who are women declined in from percent to percent but has since climbed to percent in The fact that the female share fell during the Great Recession and has risen during the recovery is consistent with men moving into agriculture as employment in the nonfarm economy declines and out of agriculture as nonfarm job prospects improve The rising female share is also consistent with the fact that as labor costs rise some growers are adopting mechanical aids such as hydraulic platforms that replace ladders in treefruit harvesting and mobile conveyor belts that reduce the distance heavy loads must be carried which facilitate more women and older workers in performing tasks that traditionally have been performed by younger men Geographic Distribution of Hired Farmworkers By Place of Residence According to the American Community Survey percent of hired farmworkers reside in counties that are defined as metro urban This largely reflects the fact that most of the main farming areas in California Arizona and other Western States lie in large counties that also include major cities and thus are defined as metropolitan Wages of Hired Farmworkers According to data from the FLS real inflationadjusted wages for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers excluding contract labor rose at an average annual rate of percent per year between and In the past years however real farm wages grew at percent per year consistent with growers reports that workers were harder than usual to find In the average real farm wage for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers was just over half the average real wage in the nonfarm economy for privatesector nonsupervisory occupations versus in dollars By the farm wage was equal to percent of the nonfarm wage In other words the gap between farm and nonfarm wages is slowly shrinking but still substantial Wages for nonsupervisory occupations varied little across occupations ranging from for graders and sorters and for farmworkers in the livestock sector to for equipment operators For five out the six nonsupervisory occupations however wages were more than percent higher in than in not adjusted for inflation Average hourly wages for hired agricultural managers stood at in up percent from the year before Supervisors averaged per hour up percent Average wages by occupation Occupation SOC code Employment share percent Average hourly wage Nominal wage growth percent change Graders and sorters agricultural products

farmworkers Farmers ranchers and agricultural managers Firstline supervisors Subtotal supervisory and nonsupervisory occupations All other farm occupations All farm occupations Note SOC Standard Occupational Classification SOC Components may not sum to percent because of independent rounding Source USDA Economic Research Service using data from USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Farm Labor Survey As of the survey no longer counts contracted agricultural service workers Labor Cost Share of Total Gross Revenues Although farm wages are rising in nominal and real terms the impact of these rising costs on farmers incomes has been offset by rising productivity andor output prices As a result labor costs as a share of gross cash income do not show an upward trend for the industry as a whole over the past years For all farms labor costs including contract labor and cash fringe benefit costs averaged percent of gross cash income during compared with percent during However these trends in labor cost shares differ by commodity Labor cost shares have fallen slightly over the past years for the more laborintensive fruit and vegetable sectors although they appear to have been trending upwards again in the past few years On dairies and in nursery operations both of which also rely heavily on immigrant labor labor costs as a share of income are at or near their year highs HA Temporary Agricultural Program The HA Temporary Agricultural Programoften called the HA visa programprovides a legal means to bring foreignborn workers to the United States to perform seasonal farm labor on a temporary basis for a period of up to months Crop farmers can use this program to meet their seasonal labor needs but most livestock producers such as ranches dairies and hog and poultry operations are not legally allowed to use the program to meet yearround labor needs An exception to this restriction is made for producers of livestock on the range such as sheep and goat operations who can use HA workers yearround Employers in the HA program must demonstrate and the US Department of Labor must certify that efforts to recruit US workers were not successful Employers must also pay a Statespecific minimum wage which may not be lower than the average wage for crop and livestock workers surveyed in the FLS in that region in the prior year known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate AEWR See the next section for details on the AEWR In addition employers must provide housing for their HA workers and pay for their domestic and international transportation One of the clearest indicators of the scarcity of farm labor is the fact that the number of HA positions requested and approved has increased more than sevenfold in the past years from just over positions certified in fiscal to around in fiscal year The average duration of an HA certification in fiscal was months implying that the positions certified represented around fullyear equivalents A certified job does not necessarily result in the issuance of a visa in fact in recent years only about percent of jobs certified as HA have resulted in visas Around visas were issued in fiscal by the Department of State Adverse Effect Wage Rate HA employers must provide transportation and housing and pay the higher of the applicable State or federal minimum wage the prevailing wage in that region and occupation as determined by the US Department of Labor or the regional average farm wage observed in the NASS FLS The latter is known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate AEWR reflecting the legal requirement that HA employment should not negatively affect domestic farmworkers by lowering the average wage For fiscal this minimum hourly wage ranged from in Alabama Arkansas Georgia Louisiana Mississippi and South Carolina to in California and in the District of Columbia Legal Status and Migration Practices of Hired Crop Farmworkers Legal immigration status is difficult to measure not many surveys ask the question and unauthorized respondents may be reluctant to answer truthfully if asked The US Department of Labors National Agricultural Workers Survey NAWS provides data on farmworkers legal immigration status NAWS data believed to be of high quality is gathered by trained and trusted enumerators who conduct facetoface interviews with workers at their job sites and with their employers permission NAWS also queries workers on their inter and intranational migration patterns One limitation of the NAWS however is that it excludes the growing number of HA workers as well as all hired livestock workers Roughly Half of Hired Crop Farmworkers Lack Legal Immigration Status The share of hired crop farmworkers who were not legally authorized to work in the United States grew from roughly percent in to almost percent in in recent years it has declined to about percent In percent of crop farmworkers were US born percent were immigrants who had obtained US citizenship percent were other authorized immigrants primarily permanent residents or greencard holders and the remaining percent held no work authorization The share of workers who are US born is highest in the Midwest while the share who are unauthorized is highest in California More Farmworkers Are Settled Fewer Are Migrants Around percent of hired crop farmworkers are not migrant workers but are considered settled meaning that they work at a single location within miles of their home This share is up from percent in reflecting a profound change in the nature of the crop farm workforce Among the small share of remaining migrant workers the largest group is shuttlers who work at a single farm location more than miles from home and may cross an international border to get to their worksite Shuttlers made up about percent of hired crop farmworkers in down from about percent in More common in the past the follow the crop migrant farmworker who moves from State to State working on different crops as the seasons advance is now a relative rarity These workers made up just percent of those surveyed by the NAWS in down from a high of percent in The final category of hired crop farmworkers is newcomers to farming whose migration patterns have not yet been established The fact that they now represent just percent of the crop farm workforce down from as much as percent in in part reflecting the slowdown in net migration from Mexico to the United States since Links to Key Data Sources From the US Department of Agriculture Farm Labor Survey The Farm Labor Survey FLS conducted by USDAs National Agricultural Statistics Service NASS is based on semiannual phone interviews with a random sample of farm employers crops and livestock who are asked to provide quarterly data on their wage bill employment counts and average weekly hours for all hired workers by occupation Contract labor is excluded and no demographic information on the workforce is collected Each year the FLSs estimate of the annual average wage for nonsupervisory field and livestock workers in each of regions is used as the basis for the Adverse Effect Wage Rate AEWR which sets a minimum wage for HA workers in the following year The survey is described here and its quarterly reports are archived here Data and statistics can also be obtained via NASS Quick Stats Census of Agriculture Every years years ending in and NASS conducts a full census of every farm in the country Published statistics include national State and countylevel tables on many topics including land use and ownership operator characteristics production practices income and expenditures Information on total employment a simple head count not adjusted for fullyear or fulltime equivalency and labor expenditures including contract labor is also available Again almost no demographic information on the hired farm work force is collected The Census is described here Published tables from the Census are here Data can also be obtained via

what happened to the skyhigh job openings the massive number of people quitting during the Great Resignation and hot wage growth Well the labor market is looking more like the healthy but boring era of or Nick Bunker economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab told Business Insider Thats opposed to the wild swings we saw during the COVID pandemic This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers Become an Insider and start reading now Bunker said were seeing less drama in jobs data Thats a good thing in my view Bunker said given an incredibly dramatic few years Advertisement Job growth is still doing great though the US just added jobs in March although thats a slower pace than during the height of the pandemic recovery Wage growth has slowed The share of Americans working or looking for work has held mostly steady since spring Job openings have also dropped and have been at a rate of for three straight months The number of layoffs and discharges have been low And that more boring but steady labor market could be great news for workers and job seekers Julia Pollak ZipRecruiters chief economist told Business Insider the minimal changes are great amid a labor market thats resilient stable and robust Everything is holding on better than most people had predicted Pollak said Advertisement Pollak pointed to employment strength in construction and manufacturing Construction employment for March was higher than the prepandemic level in February Manufacturing employment was higher and its employment was unchanged from this past February to this past March The longfeared recession following the wild swings of the early pandemic years has yet to emerge and may not even be on the horizon I think stability at a time of high interest rates and restrictive monetary policy expected to lead to losses and declines is something to be celebrated Pollak said And most of the small changes lately have been in the right direction The US could be in a Goldilocks job market The four charts below show what that looks like Job quitting People looking for a new job have bargaining power but workers are more likely to stick around their current gigs Advertisement Job seekers still have some bargaining power but are less willing to demonstrate that power by leaving their jobs Bunker said With fewer new job opportunities and less of a pay bump for switching roles more employees are staying put However layoff rates are still low so workers have robust job security compared to prepandemic levels Related stories Newly released data for February showed the US quits rate had been for four straight months This rate has cooled down from in April There were million quits in February which the BLS news release noted this metric was little changed Wage growth Average hourly earnings increased from March to this past March lower than the yearoveryear increase of around in March Despite that slowdown wages have recently been growing faster than prices meaning workers have more buying power Advertisement That means real money in the pockets of working families Julie Su acting secretary of labor told Business Insider Its exactly what wed want to see Inflation in March as measured by the yearoveryear percent change in the Consumer Price Index ticked up a little last month but remains less of a problem than last year It climbed from March to March compared to a increase from February to February Given moderating wage growth the Fed could be more inclined to lower interest rates later this year Pollak said the cooler wage growth is good news for a Fed thats still battling inflation Job switchers are seeing higher wage growth than people staying according to the month moving average of median wage growth from the Atlanta Feds Wage Growth Tracker Wage growth has slowed though for both job switchers and stayers Advertisement Nominal wage growth may have slowed but real wage growth which is what really matters for workers purchasing power remains positive and high Pollak told BI Job switchers and current workers are still experiencing solid real wage growth and have clearly retained much of the leverage gained during the pandemic They are getting recruited negotiating their job offers and are receiving counteroffers from old employers intent on retaining them at historically high rates Unemployment insurance claims Initial claims for unemployment insurance can be a helpful layoff metric spiking when lots of people lose their jobs Right now the boringly low rate of those initial applications for benefits suggests that any kind of largescale layoffs still have yet to emerge Initial claims decreased from the week ending March to the week ending April In general initial claims have been low so far this year compared to the high level of weekly claims during the pandemic Although there is plenty of speculation that employment has slowed down recent numbers including job openings as well as initial jobless claims continue to indicate that the US labor market has remained stable Eugenio Alemn Raymond James chief economist said in a note earlier this month Advertisement Unemployment Back in January the unemployment rate was after spiking into the double digits during the pandemic shutdowns in spring It has cooled down to this past March just above the historically low rates seen through most of the last two years Additionally the number of people who went from being employed to unemployed has not seen too dramatic of a change this number was around million for each of the past few months So what will happen to the Goldilocks job market It would be nice to live in a world where we have low unemployment and theres steady consistent gains in wage growth and more people coming into the labor market Bunker said So hopefully fingers crossed dramatic days are behind us and we can see some strong gains for workers for job seekers But not in the way that feels discombobulated While openings wage growth and the hires rate have cooled the overall labor market can be described as more Goldilockslike or not too hot and not too cold Advertisement Its a labor market that has strength and theres a path ahead of it where it can continue to grow in a sustainable manner Bunker said Juliana Kaplan contributed reporting,Changing jobs What less drama in the job

slowdown wages have recently been growing faster than prices meaning workers have more buying power Advertisement That means real money in the pockets of working families Julie Su acting secretary of labor told Business Insider Its exactly what wed want to see Inflation in March as measured by the yearoveryear percent change in the Consumer Price Index ticked up a little last month but remains less of a problem than last year It climbed from March to March compared to a increase from February to February Given moderating wage growth the Fed could be more inclined to lower interest rates later this year Pollak said the cooler wage growth is good news for a Fed thats still battling inflation Job switchers are seeing higher wage growth than people staying according to the month moving average of median wage growth from the Atlanta Feds Wage Growth Tracker Wage growth has slowed though for both job switchers and stayers Advertisement Nominal wage growth may have slowed but real wage growth which is what really matters for workers purchasing power remains positive and high Pollak told BI Job switchers and current workers are still experiencing solid real wage growth and have clearly retained much of the leverage gained during the pandemic They are getting recruited negotiating their job offers and are receiving counteroffers from old employers intent on retaining them at historically high rates Unemployment insurance claims Initial claims for unemployment insurance can be a helpful layoff metric spiking when lots of people lose their jobs Right now the boringly low rate of those initial applications for benefits suggests that any kind of largescale layoffs still have yet to emerge Initial claims decreased from the week ending March to the week ending April In general initial claims have been low so far this year compared to the high level of weekly claims during the pandemic Although there is plenty of speculation that employment has slowed down recent numbers including job openings as well as initial jobless claims continue to indicate that the US labor market has remained stable Eugenio Alemn Raymond James chief economist said in a note earlier this month Advertisement Unemployment Back in January the unemployment rate was after spiking into the double digits during the pandemic shutdowns in spring It has cooled down to this past March just above the historically low rates seen through most of the last two years Additionally the number of people who went from being employed to unemployed has not seen too dramatic of a change this number was around million for each of the past few months So what will happen to the Goldilocks job market It would be nice to live in a world where we have low unemployment and theres steady consistent gains in wage growth and more people coming into the labor market Bunker said So hopefully fingers crossed dramatic days are behind us and we can see some strong gains for workers for job seekers But not in the way that feels discombobulated While openings wage growth and the hires rate have cooled the overall labor market can be described as more Goldilockslike or not too hot and not too cold Advertisement Its a labor market that has strength and theres a path ahead of it where it can continue to grow in a sustainable manner Bunker said Juliana Kaplan contributed reporting

Minimum Wages in China Last Updated on February Minimum wages in China continue to rise in We offer a guide to minimum wages in the Chinese Mainland and discuss how labor costs are affected by changes to the minimum wage levels Minimum wages in China continue to rise As of February Shanghai has the highest monthly minimum wage among provinces RMB US per month and Beijing has the highest hourly minimum wage RMB US per hour regions Anhui Beijing Chongqing Fujian Gansu Guangdong including Shenzhen Hainan Hebei Henan Hubei Jiangsu Jiangxi Liaoning Ningxia Shaanxi Shandong Shanghai Sichuan Tianjin and Zhejiang have surpassed the RMB US mark in their monthly minimum wage standards At the lower end of the wage spectrum Jilin and Xinjiangs minimum wage level RMB per month is slightly higher than that in Heilongjiang RMB per month In provinces including Anhui Beijing Guangxi Guizhou Gansu Hainan Hebei Qinghai Shaanxi Shandong Shanghai Shanxi Tianjin and Yunnan have raised their minimum wage standards Coming into the new minimum wage standards of Hennan Jiangsu and Zhejiang took effect from January Hubeis new minimum wage standards will be effective from February Ningxias new minimum wage standard will take effect from March Jiangxis new minimum wage standard will take effect from April Liaonings new minimum wage standards will come into effect on May What is the minimum wage in China According to Chinas Provisions on Minimum Wage the legal minimum wage refers to the minimum labor remunerations that shall be paid by the employers to the employees under the precondition that the employee has provided normal labor within the promissory working hours or within the working hours that is prescribed in the labor contracts The minimum wage standards are determined by provincial governments by taking into consideration factors such as the minimum living costs of local employees and their dependents the urban residents consumption price index the social insurance premiums and the housing funds paid by the employees themselves the average salary of the employees the level of local economic development the local employment status etc Find Business Support Salary Benchmarking in China In general the minimum wage standards appear in two forms namely the monthly minimum wage standard and the hourly minimum wage standard The monthly minimum wage standard applies to fulltime employees while the hourly minimum wage standard applies to nonfulltime employees such as parttime and temporary employees To be noted the minimum wage is just the basic wage that employers must pay their employees which excludes overtime pay night shift allowance summer hightemperature allowance the special working environment allowance and subsidies for meals transportation and housing Nevertheless Chinas minimum wage standards do include the social insurance premiums and housing fund contributions paid by employees in most regions In fact it is possible that the employees takehome pay is lower than the corresponding minimum wage standard in these regions Only a few regions such as Shanghai clearly stipulate in their local rules that their local minimum wage standards exclude social insurance premiums and housing fund contributions Local governments in China are generally required to update their minimum wages every few years but have the flexibility to adjust wages according to local conditions Most provinces set different classes of minimum wage levels for different areas depending on the given regions level of development and cost of living For example a higher minimum wage class is established for the provincial capital and the most developed cities in the province whereas smaller cities and rural areas fall under a lower

while the hourly minimum wage is for parttime employment Hunan Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces allow each city to decide which minimum wage level to apply The cities given as examples are therefore subject to change What is affected by the minimum wage increase As the minimum wage rises minimum standards for other employee benefits such as overtime pay other allowances and subsidies increase in kind Housing fund The minimum contribution base of the housing fund in many cities is the same as the local minimum wage standards The change of the minimum wage means the adjustment of the housing fund contribution base in the following months The ceiling of the housing fund contribution base is usually three times the local average monthly salary of employees in the previous year and the floor of the housing fund contribution base is usually the same as the local minimum wage standard To be noted however the adjustment of the housing fund contribution base is not always in sync with the change in the minimum wage standard For example to reduce labor costs and help struggling businesses survive in the wake of the COVID pandemic the Shanghai government decided that its minimum contribution base of the housing fund in will follow the minimum wage standard rather than the one Companies are suggested to pay attention to announcements from the local government Wages during the probation period Article of the Labor Contract Law stipulates that the wage amount of a worker during their probation period shall not be less than the lowest wage amount for the same job position in the employers organization or percent of the wage amount agreed in the labor contract and shall not be less than the minimum wage standard of the locality of the employer Therefore the wages paid by the enterprise to the probationary employees who are on regular attendance should not be lower than the corresponding standard amount Wages during sick leave Different cities have different standards regarding sick leave payments But one universal rule is that the sick leave wage shall not be lower than percent of the local minimum wage according to the Opinions on Several Issues concerning the Implementation of the Labor Law of the Peoples Republic of China Lao Bu Fa No Correspondingly the minimum sick leave wage standard shall be adjusted with the increase of the local minimum wage standard Severance payment Article of the Implementation Regulations for the Labor Contract Law of the Peoples Republic of China stipulates that the monthly salary used for calculating the severance payment to an employee shall be no less than the local minimum wage standard If the average pay of the employee in the months before the termination of the labor contract is less than the local minimum wage standard the local minimum wage standard shall be used to calculate the severance payment Wages during the suspension of work or production Companies may decide to suspend their businesses or production in the wake of internal or external difficulties such as during lockdowns caused by the pandemic According to relevant provisions on wage payment during the period of suspension of production If the suspension period is within one wage payment cycle salaries shall be paid according to the standards stipulated in the labor contract and If the suspension period goes beyond one wage payment cycle the living allowance shall be paid by the enterprise and the living allowance shall be implemented in accordance with the relevant local regulations Referring to the regulations of Zhejiang Province Hubei Province and Shaanxi Province the employer is required to pay a living allowance of percent of the local minimum wage Wages of dispatched employees According to Article of the Labor Contract Law during the period in which a dispatched worker is not assigned any work duties the labor dispatch agency shall pay the worker remuneration on a monthly basis pursuant to the local minimum wage standard Wages of injured workers Article and Article of the Regulations on WorkRelated Injury Insurance stipulates that where a worker who sustained a work injury is

the injury Where the amount of disability allowance calculated is less than the local minimum wage standard the shortfall shall be covered by the workrelated injury insurance fund Unemployment insurance benefits The Guiding Opinions of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Finance on Adjusting the Criteria for Unemployment Insurance Benefits Ren She Bu Fa No stipulates that With the development of the society and economy all provinces shall on the premise of ensuring a sustainable fund appropriately improve the level of unemployment security step by step to improve the unemployment insurance benefit criteria to percent of the local minimum wage standard In practice unemployment insurance benefits are usually paid at percent of the local minimum wage standard Impact on Chinas labor costs Minimum wages only tell part of the story of labor costs in China As Chinas economy moves up the value chain and makes the transition to innovation and services most workers employed by foreigninvested enterprises earn above the minimum wage For example workers in Shanghai made an average of RMB US per month through nearly four times the local minimum wage Moreover employer social insurance and housing fund obligations add around an additional percent to employers labor costs on top of the employees gross salary For foreign investors rising wages are an unavoidable feature of doing business in China Yet when other factors like productivity infrastructure transportation costs and access to a massive domestic market are considered China may still emerge as the more costefficient option compared to countries with lower statutory labor costs When comparing locations for foreign investment in China minimum wages are a helpful barometer to gauge labor costs across different regions From there identifying industryspecific wage levels availability of talent and access to regional incentives offers a more nuanced view of ultimate labor costs within a given region The article was first published on January and was last updated on January,Minimum Wages in China A Complete Guide China Briefing A Guide to Minimum Wages in China Last

to Chinas Provisions on Minimum Wage the legal minimum wage refers to the minimum labor remunerations that shall be paid by the employers to the employees under the precondition that the employee has provided normal labor within the promissory working hours or within the working hours that is prescribed in the labor contracts The minimum wage standards are determined by provincial governments by taking into consideration factors such as the minimum living costs of local employees and their dependents the urban residents consumption price index the social insurance premiums and the housing funds paid by the employees themselves the average salary of the employees the level of local economic development the local employment status etc Find Business Support Salary Benchmarking in China In general the minimum wage standards appear in two forms namely the monthly minimum wage standard and the hourly minimum wage standard The monthly minimum wage standard applies to fulltime employees while the hourly minimum wage standard applies to nonfulltime employees such as parttime and temporary employees To be noted the minimum wage is just the basic wage that employers must pay their employees which excludes overtime pay night shift allowance summer hightemperature allowance the special working environment allowance and subsidies for meals transportation and housing Nevertheless Chinas minimum wage standards do include the social insurance premiums and housing fund contributions paid by employees in most regions In fact it is possible that the employees takehome pay is lower than the corresponding minimum wage standard in these regions Only a few regions such as Shanghai clearly stipulate in their local rules that their local minimum wage standards exclude social insurance premiums and housing fund contributions Local governments in China are generally required to update their minimum wages every few years but have the flexibility to adjust wages according to local conditions Most provinces set different classes of minimum wage levels for different areas depending on the given regions level of development and cost of living For example a higher minimum wage class is established for the provincial capital and the most developed cities in the province whereas smaller cities and rural areas fall under a lower wage class The minimum wage in China guide

usual rate for any hours worked over in a given week Employees who receive regular salaries regardless of the hours they work are exempt from overtime requirements so long as they pass a duties test

federal regulators announced this week The suit by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission targeted BaronHR LLC and Radiant Services Corp a Baron client that operates a commercial laundry facility in the Harbor Gateway near Carson and allegedly exercised the same discriminatory practices Protecting individuals seeking entrylevel or temporary jobs from discrimination in recruitment and hiring is a key enforcement priority for the commission as set forth in the EEOCs most recent strategic enforcement plan EEOC General Counsel Karla Gilbride said in announcing the settlement Individuals seeking work through staffing agencies fall squarely within the category of vulnerable workers Baron closed in January The lawsuit alleged that since at least Baron failed to recruit and refer workers for lowskill positions based on their race including those who are Black Asian White and nonHispanic The company which operated branch offices in California Nevada Colorado and Illinois also allegedly screened out job seekers with disabilities and perceived disabilities by only hiring and referring supposedly physically fit candidates with no history of injury Officials with Radiant

Baron in May and regularly inquired about employment opportunities The woman visited Barons Carson office on March to inquire about available positions and saw a group of workers training for assignment at Radiant When she asked if she was eligible a receptionist told her that the client does not hire Black workers the suit says Two other Black women applied for jobs at Barons Carson

to linking these two issues in a legislative package Congress however only has days to act before leaving for recess and so far theyve been unable to make a deal Congressional Republicans want for example to restrict the asylum process and the Biden administrations parole program that lets migrants live and work in the US temporarily This is an opportunity to consult the research and data that show us what immigration actually does to an economy Zeke Hernandez is a professor at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School He has a forthcoming book on this subject that will be published in June called The Truth About Immigration Why Successful Societies Welcome Newcomers Hernandez spoke with Marketplace Morning Report host Sabri BenAchour and the following is an edited transcript of their conversation Sabri BenAchour When it comes to the economics of immigration there is the big one immigration and its effect on wages and jobs So lets start there Does immigration reduce wages Zeke Hernandez The short answer is no I understand that thats a big question but we have enough evidence to know that the answer is no Immigration doesnt cause job losses either for native workers BenAchour I have a feeling many people are asking Why not How does it not Hernandez Yeah and thats exactly the right question Because it seems surprising Lets start with the big picture What goes into job creation Or you could even think economic growth more broadly right And thats going to be a function of yes the number of workers in the economy but also a lot of other things like the amount of investment in the economy the number and the quality of new ideas that people have the number of new businesses that people start because of the ideas the new technologies that are introduced into the economy the amount of demand the variety of goods and services that are demanded So all of those are the ingredients that go into creating jobs and growing an economy And the short of it is that the evidence tells us that immigrants contribute positively to all of those ingredients That is immigrants when they settle in a community that community receives a lot more investment When immigrants arrive there are not just more workers that are competing with native workers but there are more people who demand housing entertainment food education And so you need to hire more people to satisfy that bigger demand Immigrants disproportionately start businesses and those businesses create jobs The remaining question for someone whos listening to me might be But wait a minute If there are more immigrants in my neighborhood or my state or my country doesnt that mean more immigrants competing for the same jobs which will either take my jobs or lower my wages And surprisingly the evidence shows us that thats not the case And we have evidence from lots of different studies on that And some of them show what happens when theres these big unexpected influxes of say refugees or a lot of workers that show up in a place And some of them look at more regular migration And they all agree that immigration that doesnt take away jobs from natives And it tends not to lower wages There are sometimes some exceptional drops in wages for a little bit but those recover very fast So why would that be the case One is like I said when you have these newcomers theyre also growing the economy So its not just the supply of workers that increases but the demand for other things also increases which means the economic pie is bigger which is why theres not zerosum competition The other reason is that someone whos worried about immigrants taking jobs or lowering wages is often assuming that an immigrant worker is identical to a native worker But theyre not For example we know that immigrants take and want different jobs for example in farms in factories and construction that natives simply wont do The other thing is that even for cases where an immigrant and a native might be working in the same sector say like construction immigrants bring different skills and natives have different skills And so the immigrant might allocate into say the manual part of the construction job that doesnt require language skills because maybe the immigrant doesnt speak English well And that means that the native will kind of allocate into say becoming the foreman where he can use his language skills And so then you dont get that direct competition for those two reasons BenAchour Some people will say Its not that natives wont do jobs Its just that you know we have to pay them more to get them to do those jobs So we dont actually need immigrants to do them Hernandez Yeah I understand Again we have no evidence to support that And in many sectors we do have very clear evidence that natives simply will not do the jobs Ill give you an a pretty extreme example that makes the point So Michael Clemens has a study looking at North Carolina farm jobs in In that year because of the aftermath of the financial crisis that North Carolina was still suffering there were half a million unemployed North Carolinians And there were job openings in North Carolina farms Out of those jobs there were applications from native workers Of those all were hired of them showed up to work and only seven finished the harvest So thats pretty stark right I mean thats not a matter of like you know payment or competition Thats just a matter of like theres a job that nobody wants Ive also spent a lot of time talking with factory managers in the Midwest in Milwaukee and in other states around there And consistently the story they tell me is they actually would prefer to hire native workers who speak English they tell me its much easier But they cant They just cant get them to work If they work they cant get them to stay in the job And so they end up resorting to the immigrant labor market And so part of the assumption is that again a worker is the same whether theyre a native or not but even employers would prefer native workers because its less hassle but they just cant find them BenAchour Last year Jerome Powell head of the Federal Reserve he said that some of the abnormally high growth in wages could be due to a temporary drop in immigration that we saw for a time Doesnt that imply that he thinks theres some effect Connection Hernandez Well there is a connection between labor shortages and inflation But I think that it doesnt mean that the influx of immigrants therefore would lower the wages of native workers Jerome Powell was talking about the drop in immigration from the COVID pandemic which was kind of made stronger because of Trumps sort of restrictions on immigration during that time By most estimates the US lost over million immigrants as a result of those policies during the COVID years What Powell was referring to is not that immigrant workers were competing with native workers But what he is talking about is just that overall because there was a shortage of workers businesses just had to restrict output They couldnt produce as many goods and services And they couldnt find enough people to work And so they had to raise wages for everyone But I want to emphasize everyone not just native workers And so I think the link Powell was making is a little more complex Its about supply shortages and the fact that without workers companies cant produce as much which then ends up leading to inflation both in wages and in the prices of the goods and services companies produce BenAchour You mentioned there are some jobs that native workers just will not do That raises the question Is there an economic need for immigrants Or more specifically where is there an economic need for immigrants Hernandez Yeah and I think in some ways thats the right question So here are some facts Immigrants are of the labor force OK But they are of workers and household services in clothing manufacturing in agriculture in hospitality in food production in electronics manufacturing and just about a quarter in construction laundry services and other kinds of manufacturing So the point there is that where you see sectors that immigrants are disproportionately represented in the workforce those are the kinds of jobs where we really need immigrants But there are also on the highskill side so notice that the jobs I just listed tend to be jobs that require whats often called unskilled work or workers without college degrees But for example on the highly skilled educated workforce immigrants are again just about to of the workforce but they account for of all patents produced in the US Immigrants are of the population but they are founders of of all startups and over half of all hightech highgrowth startups that achieve a valuation of a billion dollars or more And so whether you look at the unskilled or the highly skilled sector the economy needs these immigrants and not just needs them but benefits from them in a disproportionate sense BenAchour What is the connection between immigration and investment Hernandez So the connection is that when there are more immigrants in your community companies from the immigrants home country invest more in your community So one example would be theres a reasonably fastgrowing restaurant chain called Pollo Campero in the US Its its a fried chicken chain kind of like KFC or ChickfilA Theyre a company from Guatemala and theyre very very popular in Central America And so they followed this strategy of finding opportunities in the US market by opening restaurants in communities that have a lot of Central American immigrants and from their growing into serving the rest of the population including natives born in the United States And thats just an illustration that the movement of Central Americans into different communities in the US attracted investment from this company Pollo Campero which then creates jobs in those communities and contributes in other ways And so thats just an anecdote but a lot of the research Ive done over the years shows that that applies in general That is that where immigrants move investment from their countries follow and that investment creates jobs And thats really critical because if you want jobs you need investment first and immigration is a precursor of investment That would be the chain BenAchour New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently said New York would have to cut its budget to accommodate the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on housing an influx of migrants He was exaggerating because the budget was going to be cut anyway But it raises the question about people seeking asylum on the Southern border as weve seen Presumably many of these people do end up working generating economic activity paying taxes even But they also use social services like the mayor was complaining about So what about that situation How does that net out Hernandez In the long run it nets out positively for the US economy But you know Mayor Adams and others who are complaining about the shortterm costs of welcoming immigrants and helping them get on their feet they do have a point Theyre not wrong that in the short run meaning over months and in perhaps the first year or so there are a lot of localities and states that do have to spend disproportionately on public services for immigrants whether thats temporary housing or a receiving center providing education for the children of those immigrants that is actually correct There are shortterm costs of welcoming immigrants in the same way that there are shortterm costs of any new person Like a baby thats born in New York City is going to cost New York City something And so its a very legitimate conversation as to whether the federal government is providing say enough help to New York City and other localities In my opinion the federal government is not providing enough support because the federal government in the long run will collect the income taxes that those immigrants and their children will pay without incurring the shortterm costs of welcoming them So I think that is a legitimate concern But it is important to think about how it nets out in the long run And so there is evidence showing that every first generation immigrant on average cost the state per year for the state primarily because immigrants have more children And so the cost of education is higher for immigrants than for natives But when you go to the second and third generation that is the children and grandchildren of those immigrants states collect a lot more than that They collect across the two generations And thats by the way netpresent value terms meaning holding equal the timing of the inflows So fair point But the wrong conclusion would be to say therefore dont allow immigrants in because in the long run the economies of the states would be worse off BenAchour As we can see in Congress right now views on how much immigration the US should permit and what that looks like hotly debated Can economics provide some kind of semiobjective guide of knowing how many workers how many immigrants we ought to bring Hernandez I dont think that anyone can give you an exact number and tell you that it came from any sensible analysis I think it would be a lie to say that theres an exact number I think we can say some things with quite a bit of confidence For example we know that the US doesnt admit enough immigrants through work visas or green cards to meet the needs of the economy For reference the last time the US updated its visa system was in Back then the economy was trillion in size Today its over trillion So weve more than doubled the size of the economy but we havent budged on the number of workers that we let in or foreigners of any kind Were not even replacing the number of people that die in primeworking age through our immigration system So we would at least want to do that But our numbers are already too low given the number of jobs that startups are creating that firms are creating So the answer is we can handle a lot more The Penn Wharton Budget Model recently estimated that if we double the number of immigrants we let in legally GDP would continue to grow And then the last answer Id give you to that is that there are many periods throughout history and across countries where there have been no restrictions on the number of immigrants We havent found any systematic evidence that there was economic harm to natives or to the economy But we have found a lot of evidence that there were benefits And so I dont have a number for you But I can say we can handle a lot more and not only that that we need it given the size of the economy relative to the supply of foreigners that our system allows,How immigration

just needs them but benefits from them in a disproportionate sense BenAchour What is the connection between immigration and investment Hernandez So the connection is that when there are more immigrants in your community companies from the immigrants home country invest more in your community So one example would be theres a reasonably fastgrowing restaurant chain called Pollo Campero in the US Its its a fried chicken chain kind of like KFC or ChickfilA Theyre a company from Guatemala and theyre very very popular in Central America And so they followed this strategy of finding opportunities in the US market by opening restaurants in communities that have a lot of Central American immigrants and from their growing into serving the rest of the population including natives born in the United States And thats just an illustration that the movement of Central Americans into different communities in the US attracted investment from this company Pollo Campero which then creates jobs in those communities and contributes in other ways And so thats just an anecdote but a lot of the research Ive done over the years shows that that applies in general That is that where immigrants move investment from their countries follow and that investment creates jobs And thats really critical because if you want jobs you need investment first and immigration is a precursor of investment That would be the chain BenAchour New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently said New York would have to cut its budget to accommodate the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on housing an influx of migrants He was exaggerating because the budget was going to be cut anyway But it raises the question about people seeking asylum on the Southern border as weve seen Presumably many of these people do end up working generating economic activity paying taxes even But they also use social services like the mayor was complaining about So what about that situation How does that net out Hernandez In the long run it nets out positively for the US economy But you know Mayor Adams and others who are complaining about the shortterm costs of welcoming immigrants and helping them get on their feet they do have a point Theyre not wrong that in the short run meaning over months and in perhaps the first year or so there are a lot of localities and states that do have to spend disproportionately on public services for immigrants whether thats temporary housing or a receiving center providing education for the children of those immigrants that is actually correct There are shortterm costs of welcoming immigrants in the same way that there are shortterm costs of any new person Like a baby thats born in New York City is going to cost New York City something And so its a very legitimate conversation as to whether the federal government is providing say enough help to New York City and other localities In my opinion the federal government is not providing enough support because the federal government in the long run will collect the income taxes that those immigrants and their children will pay without incurring the shortterm costs of welcoming them So I think that is a legitimate concern But it is important to think about how it nets out in the long run And so there is evidence showing that every first generation immigrant on average cost the state per year for the state primarily because immigrants have more children And so the cost of education is higher for immigrants than for natives But when you go to the second and third generation that is the children and grandchildren of those immigrants states collect a lot more than that They collect across the two generations And thats by the way netpresent value terms meaning holding equal the timing of the inflows So fair point But the wrong conclusion would be to say therefore dont allow immigrants in because in the long run the economies of the states would be worse off BenAchour As we can see in Congress right now views on how much immigration the US should permit and what that looks like hotly debated Can economics provide some kind of semiobjective guide of knowing how many workers how many immigrants we ought to bring Hernandez I dont think that anyone can give you an exact number and tell you that it came from any sensible analysis I think it would be a lie to say that theres an exact number I think we can say some things with quite a bit of confidence For example we know that the US doesnt admit enough immigrants through work visas or green cards to meet the needs of the economy For reference the last time the US updated its visa system was in Back then the economy was trillion in size Today its over trillion So weve more than doubled the size of the economy but we havent budged on the number of workers that we let in or foreigners of any kind Were not even replacing the number of people that die in primeworking age through our immigration system So we would at least want to do that But our numbers are already too low given the number of jobs that startups are creating that firms are creating So the answer is we can handle a lot more The Penn Wharton Budget Model recently estimated that if we double the number of immigrants we let in legally GDP would continue to grow And then the last answer Id give you to that is that there are many periods throughout history and across countries where there have been no restrictions on the number of immigrants We havent found any systematic evidence that there was economic harm to natives or to the economy But we have found a lot of evidence that there were benefits And so I dont have a number for you But I can say we can handle a lot more and not only that that we need it given the size of the economy relative to the supply of foreigners that our system allows

when minimum wages rise Nonetheless we find positive earnings and positive employment effects for both groups of workers in both states Our study uses data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Census Bureau to study large and midsized counties from these two states Average wages in these counties span the distribution of average wages in counties across the United States Our findings

if they faced such competition in the labor market Lower wages in turn cause employees to quit their jobs more often and make the jobs less attractive to other workers As a result lowwage employers

Some costs are intrinsic and unavoidable such as land acquisition and building materials But some are artificial and could be lowered especially those imposed by state and local governments They include dictating the use of highcost unionized construction labor timeconsuming environmental clearances arbitrary design criteria and socalled impact fees Collectively these costs have the effect of minimizing the number of housing units that can be constructed for a given amount of investment less bang for the buck Four years ago the Los Angeles Times illustrated the syndrome by delving into a decadelong effort to construct a small apartment project for lowincome residents of Solana Beach an affluent coastal community in San Diego County What was proposed in as an apartment project that would cost per unit became after years of political and legal wrangling a apartment project costing more than million a unit It simply would not pencil out and was ultimately suspended Solana Beach was not an isolated example Other projects costing plus million per unit have surfaced including one approved last week in Santa Monica another upscale coastal community The unit project aimed at providing shelter for homeless people and built on cityowned land will cost an estimated million It could become even costlier because of an extended development timeline Its not expected to be built until Development costs are particularly high in coastal communities but even in interior areas building modest apartments for lowincome residents easily tops per unit which is often costlier than singlefamily homes in those communities It defies logic but thats the reality of housing in California As mentioned earlier the many cost factors affecting housing in California also include impact fees While local governments had imposed some fees for decades they began escalating sharply after voters in passed Proposition the iconic property tax limit to offset the loss of tax revenue A study found that Californias fees averaging a unit were the highest in the nation and four times the national average Housing advocates have argued that reducing fees would increase production but local governments have zealously defended them Last week as Santa Monica was approving the lowincome housing project costing more than million a unit the US Supreme Court was putting the brakes on Californias impact fees The court ruled unanimously that fees constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property without compensation unless based on actual costs The case came out of El Dorado County which had imposed a traffic impact fee on retiree George Sheetz who wanted to place a manufactured home on his lot Sheetz lost in state courts which ruled that since the traffic fee was imposed by the county Board of Supervisors rather than an administrative agency it was a valid exercise of authority The Supreme Court however declared The Constitution provides no textual justification for saying that the existence or the scope of a states power to expropriate private property without just compensation varies according to the branch of government effecting the expropriation Oddly even

circumstances are even more extreme she added Theyre having to juggle being able to afford rent andor utilities versus being able to actually buy groceries so its getting to a level where its becoming very very difficult to not only recruit agents into these high cost of living areas but also retain them in those areas said Bara who is a secondgeneration FBI agent A survey last year found more than

rent or mortgages because they live in New York Newark Honolulu San Diego San Francisco Los Angeles Boston Miami Seattle and Washington DC Theyre asking for million to be included in the Justice

costs,The housing affordability crisis has no easy solutions but research has shown a tight correlation between tougher landuse regulations and higher costs Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said on Friday Speaking at Tulane University in New Orleans he began his remarks by saying Housing is so foundational to family wellbeing and security that one could argue that it transcends economics noting that good housing contributes to better outcomes in other areas such as education and employment He added that racial disparities in the ability to tap housing equity are also critical for any policies meant to advance economic mobility and resilience Unfortunately today housingboth as shelter and an investmentis not working as well as it could for too many of our neighbors Bostic said according to his prepared speech In the generally thriving metropolitan centers of the Sunbelt in the major cities of the coasts and the Midwest and even in smaller towns and rural communities housing is unaffordable for far too many He pointed out that the nationwide median income for a household is about a year and Americans must spend of that amount to own a medianprice home which costs about Thats far above the standard threshold for affordability And in some communities the percentage is even higher In the MiamiFort LauderdaleWest Palm Beach region for example Bostic said the medianprice home sucks up of household income Renters also face similar burdens he added Ive talked mainly about metropolitan areas he said But rest assured that affordability is a concern in rural places as well The issue takes on a different cast in rural areas Median incomes are lower and in many cases housing quality even access to infrastructure such as sewage are pressing concerns Despite the gloomy statistics Bostic expressed some optimism when discussing housing policy experiments pointing to efforts to relax zoning rules in Florida and Minnesota Other hopeful signs include the promotion of manufactured and prefabricated homes to boost supply while market forces are also boosting production he said Still Bostic highlighted data that show landuse regulation overall has been getting stricter And that could offer a clue to the housing crisis A quick exercise by Atlanta Fed researchers revealed a tight correlation between the restrictiveness of land use regulation at the county and metro area levels and the unaffordability of housing based on our banks affordability monitor he noted Not surprisingly perhaps it appears that the tighter the regulatory environment the costlier the housing market broadly speaking To be sure the affordability crisis is a vexing incredibly complex puzzle that defies easy solutions Bostic said acknowledging that he raised more questions than answers His remarks come as earlier hopes that lower mortgage rates would improve affordability have been tempered Signs of sticky inflation have pushed out timelines for when the Federal Reserve might lower benchmark interest rates That has sent Treasury bond yields and mortgages rates back up in recent months after they tumbled last fall Now homeowners who took advantage of low rates during the depths of the pandemic are reluctant to buy a new home and finance at higher rates resulting in a lockin effect that has limited the supply of homes on the market Meanwhile the salary Americans need to buy a starter home has nearly doubled since the pandemic according to Redfin data and the down payment on the average home has jumped in the past year alone a separate Redfin report said To keep up with higher housing costs homeowners are making more sacrifices like skipping meals and selling their belongings Housing has become so financially burdensome in America that some families can no longer afford other essentials including food and medical care and have been forced to make major sacrifices work overtime and ask others for money so they can cover their monthly costs Redfins economics research lead Chen Zhao said,Housing is unaffordable for too many Americans and tighter landuse regulations mean higher costs Atlanta Fed Fortune The housing affordability crisis has no easy solutions but research has shown a tight correlation between tougher landuse regulations and higher costs Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said on Friday Speaking at Tulane University in New Orleans he began his remarks by saying Housing is so foundational to family wellbeing and security that one could argue that it transcends economics noting that good housing contributes to better outcomes in other areas such as education and employment He added that racial disparities in the ability to tap housing equity are also critical for any policies meant to advance economic mobility and resilience Unfortunately today housingboth as shelter and an investmentis not working as well as it could for too many of our neighbors Bostic said according to his prepared speech In the generally thriving metropolitan centers of the Sunbelt in the major cities of the coasts and the Midwest and even in smaller towns and rural communities housing is unaffordable for far too many He pointed out that the nationwide median income for a household is about a year and Americans must spend of that amount to own a medianprice home which costs about Thats far above the standard threshold for affordability And in some communities the percentage is even higher In the MiamiFort LauderdaleWest Palm Beach region for example Bostic said the medianprice home sucks up of household income Renters also face similar burdens he added Ive talked mainly about metropolitan areas he said But rest assured that affordability is a concern in rural places as well The issue takes on a different cast in rural areas Median incomes are lower and in many cases housing quality even access to infrastructure such as sewage are pressing concerns Despite the gloomy statistics Bostic expressed some optimism when discussing housing policy experiments pointing to efforts to relax zoning rules in Florida and Minnesota Other hopeful signs include the promotion of manufactured and prefabricated homes to boost supply while market forces are also boosting production he said Still Bostic highlighted data that show landuse regulation overall has been getting stricter And that could offer a clue to the housing crisis A quick exercise by Atlanta Fed researchers revealed a tight correlation between the restrictiveness of land use regulation at the county and metro area levels and the unaffordability of housing based on our banks affordability monitor he noted Not surprisingly perhaps it appears that the tighter the regulatory environment the costlier the housing market broadly speaking To be sure the affordability crisis is a vexing incredibly complex puzzle that defies easy solutions Bostic said acknowledging that he raised more questions than answers His remarks come as earlier hopes that lower mortgage rates would improve affordability have been tempered Signs of sticky inflation have pushed out timelines for when the Federal Reserve might lower benchmark interest rates That has sent Treasury bond yields and mortgages rates back up in recent months after they tumbled last fall Now homeowners who took advantage of low rates during the depths of the pandemic are reluctant to buy a new home and finance at higher rates resulting in a lockin effect that has limited the supply of homes on the market Meanwhile the salary Americans need to buy a starter home has nearly doubled since the pandemic according to Redfin data and the down payment on the average home has jumped in the past year alone a separate Redfin report said To keep up with higher housing costs homeowners are

Herald-Tribune,housing costs,Backers of a new idea for funding the building of affordable and workforce housing say the method could steadily produce large numbers of units by letting growth pay for itself without hiking taxes The idea didnt start with any of the areas many longtime vocal housing advocates Instead its the work of Drayton Saunders president of Sarasotabased Michael Saunders Co the largest real estate brokerage in the region Though he unveiled it several years ago it is now gaining momentum as employers increasingly struggle to retain and recruit workers due to high housing costs which have priced out everyone from nurses and teachers to law enforcement and restaurant staff Support for the method includes the recent unanimous backing by the board of the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce Meanwhile Saunders part of Sarasota Countys Affordable Housing Advisory Committee or AHAC has watched his proposal shoot to the top of the committees recommendations to area elected officials His idea is this Use a percentage of the property tax from new development as a recurring revenue stream to fund a local affordable housing trust fund We are in the catbird seat Saunders said about the areas robust growth But now he added community leaders need to use that growth to the areas advantage and find ways to keep the region affordable for people who live and work here Sometimes your greatest strength is your greatest challenge he said Funding affordable housing in Sarasota County without increasing taxes In Saunders proposal adopted by AHAC and now backed by the Chamber the Sarasota County Commission in consultation with City of Sarasota officials and other local policymakers would decide on a percentage to carve out of property tax revenue from new development That money would be diverted to the countys Affordable Housing Trust Fund and used to help build new workforce and affordable housing Though the county has already set up the trust fund it often sits empty because theres currently no dedicated revenue source to fill it on a consistent basis Saunders suggested funding method would not entail any change in tax rates at all he stressed Nor would property owners see an increase in their tax bills Your bill will look the same whether we do this or not Saunders said The benefits of this funding method Saunders said include local control and oversight and a steady and nearguaranteed revenue source as long as there is growth Money is the secret sauce for affordable housing in Sarasota Saunders said he had several light bulb moments on the way to conceiving this idea As a former board member of the Community Foundation of Sarasota County he witnessed the deal for Sarasotas Lofts on Lemon a publicprivate partnership with the Sarasota Housing Authority that included grants and lowinterest loans from the city and local nonprofits However he also gleaned from his time on philanthropic boards that nonprofits cannot be a longterm solution or strategy on a housing crisis of this scale given how donors dollars are often tied to an array of other specific missions and responsibilities I admire the nonprofit sector for stepping in but that is not going to be something that is going to happen on every project he said When Saunders was appointed to AHAC he became an eager student of the affordable housing landscape It didnt take very long for him and his fellow members to realize that many of the standard recommendations put through things like waiving parking requirements speeding up permits developer incentives and more werent accomplishing nearly enough A mix of tools was essential to be sure But Saunders and his fellow AHAC members found that communities around the country that make headway on this problem treat affordable housing as a strategic asset like schools and hospitals and create or identify a dedicated funding source to get it built Money is the secret sauce he said Imagine he thought if just a small portion of the tax revenue from Sarasotas amazing growth could be set aside for affordable housing the way other taxincrement districts do for things like the arts The idea bubbled up after that he said but leaders needed to be shown what might be accomplished with a dedicated infusion of cash We had to wait for a pandemic and a hurricane to prove it Disaster relief is not a reliable affordable housing funding source for Sarasota County The million that the county commission agreed to carve out of its federal pandemic relief funds for affordable housing will lead to new units of affordable and workforce housing when leveraged with the initiatives of private and public partners Currently the county is accepting applications from developers for a share of an even bigger pot of affordable housing money million granted by HUD in the wake of Hurricane Ian While advocates greatly welcomed this influx of money and the affordable housing it will produce they say that more is needed to meet the demand not just for hundreds but for tens of thousands of additional units Do we want to wait for the next pandemic and hurricane to have an affordable housing strategy Saunders said I dont think so Instead of the county and its residents waiting on the next round of catastrophe funds or for developers to act on incentives a reliable funding method for Sarasotas Affordable Housing Trust would put the county in the drivers seat With cash in hand builders of affordable housing will start lining up to do business with the county Saunders predicted The real decision is the general intent to do it he said Its going to take an entire community to say to our elected officials This is so critical you cannot punt on this You need to step forward and be bold A game changer for affordable housing in Sarasota County Already sold the Greater Sarasota Chamber announced that it is planning to meet with local elected officials in the hopes of getting them on board with this funding method as part of the dozen AHAC recommendations it recently voted to support The funding idea together with the Chambers backing is a game changer for affordable housing said Jon Thaxton current AHAC chair and senior vice president for community leadership at the Gulf Coast Community Foundation A former county commissioner Thaxton for years had been calling for some sort of recurring revenue source for affordable housing before Saunders approached him Drayton had to explain it to me before I could grasp it Thaxton said When it clicked Thaxton found Saunders idea to be simplistically brilliant Elaborating on the funding methods possibilities Thaxton noted that the money could be used and leveraged with partners to greatly ramp up the building of affordable and workforce projects in many ways from building roads or extending utilities to lowering rent thresholds on partners projects or even the county buying land and building projects on its own Of the numerous positive facets of this funding method Thaxton says he is most excited about the dynamic options it will spur for the county and its residents When we are able to hold up that cash you are going to get competition from developers to build affordable housing and that is what makes it work he said There is nothing better than competition that comes with a marketdriven approach And that is

Saundra Amrhein covers the Season of Sharing campaign along with issues surrounding housing utilities child care and transportation in the area She can be reached at samrheingannettcom,Workforce housing in Sarasota County would be built using existing tax Sarasota HeraldTribune Backers of a new idea for funding the building of affordable and workforce housing say the method could steadily produce large numbers of units by letting growth pay for itself without hiking taxes The idea didnt start with any of the areas many longtime vocal housing advocates Instead its the work of Drayton Saunders president of Sarasotabased Michael Saunders Co the largest real estate brokerage in the region Though he unveiled it several years ago it is now gaining momentum as employers increasingly struggle to retain and recruit workers due to high housing costs which have priced out everyone from nurses and teachers to law enforcement and restaurant staff Support for the method includes the recent unanimous backing by the board of the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce Meanwhile Saunders part of Sarasota Countys Affordable Housing Advisory Committee or AHAC has watched his proposal shoot to the top of the committees recommendations to area elected officials His idea is this Use a percentage of the property tax from new development as a recurring revenue stream to fund a local affordable housing trust fund We are in the catbird seat Saunders said about the areas robust growth But now he added community leaders need to use that growth to the areas advantage and find ways to keep the region affordable for people who live and work here Sometimes your greatest strength is your greatest challenge he said Funding affordable housing in Sarasota County without increasing taxes In Saunders proposal adopted by AHAC and now backed by the Chamber the Sarasota County Commission in consultation with City of Sarasota officials and other local policymakers would decide on a percentage to carve out of property tax revenue from new development That money would be diverted to the countys Affordable Housing Trust Fund and used to help build new workforce and affordable housing Though the county has already set up the trust fund it often sits empty because theres currently no dedicated revenue source to fill it on a consistent basis Saunders suggested funding method would not entail any change in tax rates at all he stressed Nor would property owners see an increase in their tax bills Your bill will look the same whether we do this or not Saunders said The benefits of this funding method Saunders said include local control and oversight and a steady and nearguaranteed revenue source as long as there is growth Money is the secret sauce for affordable housing in Sarasota Saunders said he had several light bulb moments on the way to conceiving this idea As a former board member of the Community Foundation of Sarasota County he witnessed the deal for Sarasotas Lofts on Lemon a publicprivate partnership with the Sarasota Housing Authority that included grants and lowinterest loans from the city and local nonprofits However he also gleaned from his time on philanthropic boards that nonprofits cannot be a longterm solution or strategy on a housing crisis of this scale given how donors dollars are often tied to an array of other specific missions and responsibilities I admire the nonprofit sector for stepping in but that is not going to be something that is going to happen on every project he said When Saunders was appointed to AHAC he became an eager student of the affordable housing landscape It didnt take very long for him and his fellow members to realize that many of the standard recommendations put through things like waiving parking requirements speeding up permits developer incentives and more werent accomplishing nearly enough A mix of tools was essential to be sure But Saunders and his fellow AHAC members found that communities around the country that make headway on this problem treat affordable housing as a strategic asset like schools and hospitals and create or identify a dedicated funding source to get it built Money is the secret sauce he said Imagine he thought if just a small portion of the tax revenue from Sarasotas amazing growth could be set aside for affordable housing the way other taxincrement districts do for things like the arts The idea bubbled up after that he said but leaders needed to be shown what might be accomplished with a dedicated infusion of cash We had to wait for a pandemic and a hurricane to prove it Disaster relief is not a reliable affordable housing funding source for Sarasota County The million that the county commission agreed to carve out of its federal pandemic relief funds for affordable housing will lead to new units of affordable and workforce housing when leveraged with the initiatives of private and public partners Currently the county is accepting applications from developers for a share of an even bigger pot of affordable housing money million granted by HUD in the wake of Hurricane Ian While advocates greatly welcomed this influx of money and the affordable housing it will produce they say that more is needed to meet the demand not just for hundreds but for tens of thousands of additional units Do we want to wait for the next pandemic and hurricane to have an affordable housing strategy Saunders said I dont think so Instead of the county and its residents waiting on the next round of catastrophe funds or for developers to act on incentives a reliable funding method for Sarasotas Affordable Housing Trust would put the county in the drivers seat With cash in hand builders of affordable housing will start lining up to do business with the county Saunders predicted The real decision is the general intent to do it he said Its going to take an entire community to say to our elected officials This is so critical you cannot punt on this You need to step forward and be bold A game changer for affordable housing in Sarasota County Already sold the Greater Sarasota Chamber announced that it is planning to meet with local elected officials in the hopes of getting them on board with this funding method as part of the dozen AHAC recommendations it recently voted to support The funding idea together with the Chambers backing is a game changer for affordable housing said Jon Thaxton current AHAC chair and senior vice president for community leadership at the Gulf Coast Community Foundation A former county commissioner Thaxton for years had been calling for some sort of recurring revenue source for affordable housing before Saunders approached him Drayton had to explain it to me before I could grasp it Thaxton said When it clicked Thaxton found Saunders idea to be simplistically brilliant Elaborating on the funding methods possibilities Thaxton noted that the money could be used and leveraged with partners to greatly ramp up the building of affordable and workforce projects in many ways from building roads or extending utilities to lowering rent thresholds on partners projects or even the county buying land and building projects on its own Of the numerous positive facets of this funding method Thaxton says he is most excited about the dynamic options it will spur for the county and its residents When we are able to hold up that cash you are going to get competition from developers to build affordable housing and that is what makes it work he said There is nothing better than competition that comes with a marketdriven approach And that is what this is doing We dont want a good deal Thaxton added We want the best deal This story comes from a partnership between the Sarasota

Reviewed Updated Apr pm As we head into peak homebuying season signs of life have begun to spring up in the housing market Even so stillhigh mortgage rates and home prices amid historically low housing stock continue to put homeownership out of reach for many Moreover the National Association of Realtors agreed to a monumental million settlement on March following a verdict favoring home sellers in a class action lawsuit Still subject to court approval the settlement requires changes to broker commissions that will upend the buying and selling model that has been in place for years Elevated mortgage rates outofreach home prices and recordlow housing stock are the perennial weeds that experts say hopeful home buyers can expect to contend with this springand beyond The housing market is likely to continue to face the dual affordability constraints of high home prices and elevated interest rates in said Doug Duncan senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae in an emailed statement Hotterthanexpected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than wed previously forecast Despite ongoing affordability hurdles Fannie Mae forecasts an increase in home sales transactions compared to last year Experts also anticipate a slower rise in home prices this year compared to recent years but price fluctuations will continue to vary regionally and depend strongly on local market supply US home prices declined in January for the third consecutive month due to high borrowing costs according to the latest SP CoreLogic CaseShiller Home Price Index But prices yearoveryear jumped the fastest annual rate since Chief economist at First American Financial Corporation Mark Fleming predicts a flat stretch ahead If the housing market was too hot then the market was probably too cold but wont yet be just right Fleming said in his forecast For a housing recovery to occur several conditions must unfold For the best possible outcome wed first need to see inventories of homes for sale turn considerably higher says Keith Gumbinger vice president at online mortgage company HSHcom This additional inventory in turn would ease the upward pressure on home prices leveling them off or perhaps helping them to settle back somewhat from peak or nearpeak levels And of course mortgage rates would need to cool offwhich experts say is imminent despite rates edging back up toward For the week ending April the year fixed mortgage rate stood at according to Freddie Mac However when mortgage rates finally go on the descent Gumbinger says dont hope they cool too quickly Rapidly falling rates could create a surge of demand that wipes away any inventory gains causing home prices to rebound Better that rate reductions happen at a metered pace incrementally improving buyer opportunities over a stretch of time rather than all at once Gumbinger says He adds that mortgage rates returning to a more normal upper to lower range would also help the housing market over time return to levels Yet Gumbinger predicts it could be a while before we return to those rates Nonetheless Kuba Jewgieniew CEO of Realty ONE Group a real estate brokerage company is optimistic about a recovery this year Were definitely looking forward to a better housing market in as interest rates start to settle around or even lower says Jewgieniew Following years of litigation the National Association of Realtors NAR has agreed to pay million to settle a series of antitrust lawsuits filed in on behalf of home sellers The plaintiffs claimed that the leading national trade association for real estate brokers and agents conspired to require home sellers to pay the broker representing the buyer of their homes in violation of federal antitrust law Though the landmark settlement is subject to court approval most consider it a done deal The settlement requires NAR to enact new rules including prohibiting offers of broker compensation on multiple listing services MLS the private databases that allow local real estate brokers to publish and share information about residential property listings The rule is set to take effect in midJuly once the settlement receives judge approval Moreover sellers will no longer be required to pay buyer broker commissions and real estate agents participating in the MLS must establish written representation agreements with their buyer clients NAR denies any wrongdoing and maintains that its current policies benefit buyers and sellers The organization believes its not liable for seller claims related to broker commissions stating that it has never set commissions and that commissions have always been negotiable Per the settlements terms the costs associated with buying and selling a home are set to change dramatically The primary things that will change are the decoupling of the seller commission and the buyer commission in the MLS says Rita Gibbs a Realtor at Realty One Group Integrity in Tucson Its gonna cause some chaos While sellers will no longer be able to offer broker compensation in the MLS theres no rule prohibiting offMLS negotiations Because of this Gibbs suspects buyers and sellers will continue offering broker compensation off the MLS The Department of Justice confirmed it will permit listing brokers to display compensation details on their websites However buyer agents will need to undergo the tedious task of visiting countless broker websites to find whos offering what Michael Gorkowski a Virginiabased real estate agent with Compass is also trying to figure out how to manage the potential ruling We often work with buyers for many months and sometimes years before they find exactly what theyre looking for Gorkowski says So in a case where a seller isnt offering a cobroker commission we will have to negotiate that the buyer pays an agreedupon commission prior to starting their search In the short term it is absolutely going to injure buyers especially FHA and VA buyers Gibbs says With rare exception these buyers are not in a position to pay for their own agent Gibbs says that if sellers dont offer compensation many buyers who cant otherwise afford to pay a broker will choose to go unrepresented Gorkowski notes that veterans taking out VA loans face a unique challenge under the new rules Per the VA requirements buyers cannot pay so it must be negotiated with the seller for now As a result NAR is calling on the US Department of Veterans Affairs to revise its policies prohibiting VA buyers from paying broker commissions Even so theres skepticism that the federal government will be able to implement changes in time for the July deadline Gibbs and Gorkowski are among the many agents especially concerned about firsttime home buyers After July firsttime and VA buyers will be required to sign a buyerbroker agreement stating that they will compensate their brokerbut Gibbs says many wont have the means to do so In this situation agents would likely only show buyers homes where sellers are offering compensation This is a very troubling situation Gorkowski says With many homeowners locked in at ultralow interest rates or unwilling to sell due to high home prices demand continues to outpace housing supplyand likely will for a whileeven as some homeowners may finally be forced to sell due to major life events such as divorce job changes or a growing family I dont expect to see a meaningful increase in the supply of existing homes for sale until mortgage rates are back down in the low range so

homebuying season persistently high mortgage rates may hinder activity from fully flourishing Heres what the latest home sales data has to say Existinghome sales came to life in February shooting up from the month before according to the latest data from the NAR Sales dipped from a year ago Experts attribute the monthly jump to a bump in inventory Additional housing supply is helping to satisfy market demand said Lawrence Yun chief economist at NAR in the report Existing inventory rose logging million unsold homes at the end of February However there are still only months of inventory at the current sales pace Most experts consider a balanced market falling between four and six months Meanwhile existing home prices continue to soar to unprecedented heights reaching which marks the eighth consecutive month of yearly price increases and a February median home price record Sales of newly constructed singlefamily houses ticked down by a nominal compared to January but outpaced February sales by according to the latest US Census Bureau and HUD data Amid a high percentage of homeowners still locked in to low mortgage rates home builders have been picking up the slack New construction continues to be an outsized share of the housing inventory said Dr Lisa Sturtevant chief economist at Bright MLS in an emailed statement Sturtevant notes that declining new home prices are coming amid

late last year said Yun in the report Though down from its high of the average year fixed mortgage rate in remains well over amid rising home values As a result home buyers continue to face affordability challenges According to data from its firstquarter US Home Affordability Report property data provider Attom found that medianpriced singlefamily homes remain less affordable than the historical average in over of US counties For one the data uncovered that expenses are eating up more than of the average national wage Common lending guidelines require monthly mortgage payments property taxes and homeowners insurance to comprise or less of your gross income At the same time home prices and homeownership expenses continue to outpace wage growth Consequently the latest expensetowage ratio is hovering at one of the highest points over the past decade according to the Attom report despite some slight affordability improvements over the last two quarters Affording a home remains a financial stretch or a pipe dream for so many households said Rob Barber CEO at Attom Here are some expert tips to increase your chances for an optimal outcome in this tight housing market Hannah Jones a senior economic research analyst at Realtorcom offers this expert advice to aspiring buyers Gary Ashton founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of REMAX Advantage has this expert advice for sellers Despite some areas of the country experiencing monthly price declines the likelihood of a housing market crasha rapid drop in unsustainably high home prices due to waning demandremains low for The record low supply of houses on the market protects against a market crash says Tom Hutchens executive vice president of production at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions a nonQM lender Moreover experts point out that todays homeowners stand on much more secure footing than those coming out of the financial crisis with many borrowers having substantial home equity In I expect well see home appreciation take a step back but not plummet says Orphe Divounguy senior macroeconomist at Zillow Home Loans This outlook aligns with what other housing market watchers expect Comerica forecasts that national house prices will rise in said Bill Adams chief economist at Comerica Bank in an emailed statement Divounguy also notes that several factors including Millennials entering their prime homebuying years wage growth and financial wealth are tailwinds that will sustain housing demand in Even so with fewer homes selling Dan Hnatkovskyy cofounder and CEO of NewHomesMate a marketplace for new construction homes sees a price collapse within the realm of possibility especially in markets where real estate investors scooped up numerous properties If something pushes that over the edge the consequences could be severe said Hnatkovskyy in an emailed statement In February total foreclosure filings were down from the previous month but up from a year ago according to Attom These trends could signify evolving financial landscapes for homeowners prompting adjustments in market strategies and lending practices said Barber in a report Lenders began foreclosure on properties in February up from the previous month and from a year ago Meanwhile real estateowned properties or REOs which are homes unsold at foreclosure auctions and taken over by lenders spiked yearoveryear in three states South Carolina up Missouri up and Pennsylvania up Despite foreclosure activity trending up nationally and certain areas of the country seeing notable annual increases in REOs experts generally dont expect to see a wave of foreclosures in Foreclosure activity is still only at about of prepandemic levels and isnt likely to be back to numbers until sometime in midtolate says Sharga The biggest reasons for this Sharga explains are the strength of the economywere still seeing low unemployment and steady wage growthalong with excellent loan quality Massive home price growth in homeowner equity over the past few years has also helped reduce foreclosures Sharga says that some of todays homeowners have more than equity in their property So while there may be more foreclosure starts in due in part to Covidera mortgage relief programs phasing outforeclosure auctions and lender repossessions should remain below levels Buying a housein any marketis a highly personal decision Because homes represent the largest single purchase most people will make in their lifetime its crucial to be in a solid financial position before diving in Use a mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly housing costs based on your down But if youre trying to predict what might happen next year experts say this is probably not the best homebuying strategy The housing marketlike so many other marketsis almost impossible to time Divounguy says The best time for prospective buyers is when they find a home that they like that meets their familys current and foreseeable needs and that they can afford Gumbinger agrees its hard to tell wouldbe homeowners to wait for better conditions More often it seems the case that home prices generally keep rising so the goalposts for amassing a down payment keep moving and theres no guarantee that tomorrows conditions will be all that much better in the aggregate than todays Divounguy says getting on the housing ladder is worthwhile to begin building equity and net worth Declining mortgage rates will likely incentivize wouldbe buyers anxious to own a home to jump into the market Expect this increased demand amid todays tight housing supply to put upward pressure on home prices Most experts do not expect a housing market crash in since many homeowners have built up significant equity in their homes The issue is primarily an affordability crisis High interest rates and inflated home values have made purchasing a home challenging for firsttime homebuyers If youre in a financial position to buy a home you plan to live in for the long term it wont matter when you buy it because you will live in it through economic highs and lows However if you are looking to buy real estate as a shortterm investment

tracks builder sentiment saw a fourth consecutive monthly rise surpassing a crucial threshold with an increase from to in March A reading of or above means more builders see good conditions ahead for new construction At the same time new singlefamily building permits ticked up in Februarythe th consecutive monthly increaseaccording to the latest data from the US Census Bureau and US Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD Though some housing market data indicates signs of growth are in store this spring homebuying season persistently high mortgage rates may hinder activity from fully flourishing Heres what the latest home sales data has to say Existinghome sales came to life in February shooting up from the month before according to the latest data from the NAR Sales dipped from a year ago Experts attribute the monthly jump to a bump in inventory Additional housing supply is helping to satisfy market demand said Lawrence Yun chief economist at NAR in the report Existing inventory rose logging million unsold homes at the end of February However there are still only months of inventory at the current sales pace Most experts consider a balanced market falling between four and six months Meanwhile existing home prices continue to soar to unprecedented heights reaching which marks the eighth consecutive month of yearly price increases and a February median home price record Sales of newly constructed singlefamily houses ticked down by a nominal compared to January but outpaced February sales by according to the latest US Census Bureau and HUD data Amid a high percentage of homeowners still locked in to low mortgage rates home builders have been picking up the slack New construction continues to be an outsized share of the housing inventory said Dr Lisa Sturtevant chief economist at Bright MLS in an emailed statement Sturtevant notes that declining new home prices are coming amid a recent trend of builders introducing smaller and more affordable homes to the market The median price for a new home in February was down from a year ago See MoreSee Less NARs Pending Homes Sales Index rose in February from the month prior even as mortgage rates approached by the end of the month Pending transactions declined yearoveryear A pending home sale marks the point in the home sales transaction when the buyer and seller agree on price and terms Pending home sales are considered a leading indicator of future closed sales The Midwest and South saw monthly transaction gains while the Northeast and West saw declines due to affordability challenges in those highercost regions While modest sales growth might not stir excitement it shows slow and steady progress from the lows of late last year said Yun in the report Though down from its high of the average year fixed mortgage rate in remains well over amid rising home values As a result home buyers continue to face affordability challenges According to data from its firstquarter US Home Affordability Report property data provider Attom found that medianpriced singlefamily homes remain less affordable than the historical average in over of US counties For one the data uncovered that expenses are eating up more than of the average national wage Common lending guidelines require monthly mortgage payments property taxes and homeowners insurance to comprise or less of your gross income At the same time home prices and homeownership expenses continue to outpace wage growth Consequently the latest expensetowage ratio is hovering at one of the highest points over the past decade according to the Attom report despite some slight affordability improvements over the last two quarters Affording a home remains a financial stretch or a pipe dream for so many households said Rob Barber CEO at Attom Here are some expert tips to increase your chances for an optimal outcome in this tight housing market Hannah Jones a senior economic research analyst at Realtorcom offers this expert advice to aspiring buyers Gary Ashton founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of REMAX Advantage has this expert advice for sellers Despite some areas of the country experiencing monthly price declines the likelihood of a housing market crasha rapid drop in unsustainably high home prices due to waning demandremains low for The record low supply of houses on the market protects against a market crash says Tom Hutchens executive vice president of production at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions a nonQM lender Moreover experts point out that todays homeowners stand on much more secure footing than those coming out of the financial crisis with many borrowers having substantial home equity In I expect well see home appreciation take a step back but not plummet says Orphe Divounguy senior macroeconomist at Zillow Home Loans This outlook aligns with what other housing market watchers expect Comerica forecasts that national house prices will rise in said Bill Adams chief economist at Comerica Bank in an emailed statement Divounguy also notes that several factors including Millennials entering their prime homebuying years wage growth and financial wealth are tailwinds that will sustain housing demand in Even so with fewer homes selling Dan Hnatkovskyy cofounder and CEO of NewHomesMate a marketplace for new construction homes sees a price collapse within the realm of possibility especially in markets where real estate investors scooped up numerous properties If something pushes that over the edge the consequences could be severe said Hnatkovskyy in an emailed statement In February total foreclosure filings were down from the previous month but up from a year ago according to Attom These trends could signify evolving financial landscapes for homeowners prompting adjustments in market strategies and lending practices said Barber in a report Lenders began foreclosure on properties in February up from the previous month and from a year ago Meanwhile real estateowned properties or REOs which are homes unsold at foreclosure auctions and taken over by lenders spiked yearoveryear in three states South Carolina up Missouri up and Pennsylvania up Despite foreclosure activity trending up nationally and certain areas of the country seeing notable annual increases in REOs experts generally dont expect to see a wave of foreclosures in Foreclosure activity is still only at about of prepandemic levels and isnt likely to be back to numbers until sometime in midtolate says Sharga The biggest reasons for this Sharga explains are the strength of the economywere still seeing low unemployment and steady wage growthalong with excellent loan quality Massive home price growth in homeowner equity over the past few years has also helped reduce foreclosures Sharga says that some of todays homeowners have more than equity in their property So while there may be more foreclosure starts in due in part to Covidera mortgage relief programs phasing outforeclosure auctions and lender repossessions should remain below levels Buying a housein any marketis a highly personal decision Because homes represent the largest single purchase most people will make in their lifetime its crucial to be in a solid financial position before diving in Use a mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly housing costs based on your down But if youre trying to predict what might happen next year experts say this is probably not the best homebuying strategy The housing marketlike so many other marketsis almost impossible to time Divounguy says The best time for prospective buyers is when they find a home that they like that meets their familys current and foreseeable needs and that they can afford Gumbinger agrees its hard to tell wouldbe homeowners to wait for better conditions More often it seems the case that home prices generally keep rising so the goalposts for amassing a down payment keep moving and theres no guarantee that tomorrows conditions will be all that much better in the aggregate than todays Divounguy says getting on the housing ladder is worthwhile to begin building equity and net worth Declining mortgage rates will likely incentivize wouldbe buyers anxious to own a home to jump into the market Expect this increased demand amid todays tight housing supply to put upward pressure on home prices Most experts do not expect a housing market crash in since many homeowners have built up significant equity in their homes The issue is primarily an affordability crisis High interest rates and inflated home values have made purchasing a home challenging for firsttime homebuyers If youre in a financial position to buy a home you plan to live in for the long term it wont matter when you buy it because you will live in it through economic highs and lows However if you are looking to buy real estate as a shortterm investment it will come with more risk if you buy at the height before a recession With

house Websites like Zillow and Redfin can show you how much homes have sold for and how much sellers are listing them for in the neighborhoods youd like to live in The national median may be around

save anywhere from to of a homes price for your down payment depending on your financial circumstances and the loans youre eligible for If you dont know yet is a good target To account for closing costs double that amount If its an unrealistic savings goal thats okay You may be able to finance your closing costs Work toward a monthly budget that can accommodate a slightly higher mortgage payment Mortgage rates will vary by loan type and termfor example a year fixedrate FHA loan will have a different rate than a year conventional loan If youre not sure what type of mortgage you might qualify for focus on rates for the most popular type of mortgage the year fixedrate conventional loan Enter different home prices down payments and interest rates into a mortgage calculator to see how each variable affects your monthly payment These calculations will help you determine what price range you may be able to shop in and how much you may need to save for a down payment Include some lessthanideal scenarios in your calculations to see what might happen if home prices go up interest rates go up or you dont qualify for the best rates Targeting those goals gives you more breathing room than assuming everything will go perfectly If your mortgage calculator results make homeownership seem unrealistic dont give up Look into down payment assistance and firsttime homebuyer programs from state agencies and lenders that cater to firsttime homebuyers Conventional wisdom says to make a down payment on a home but you dont need to follow that advice Just keep in mind that if you

Conversation,housing costs,Local governments often try to combat housing costs and create affordable housing by passing legislation that changes current zoning and landuse regulations But the changes are not without controversy SciLine interviewed Jessica Trounstine the centennial chair and professor of political science at Vanderbilt University who discussed why rising housing prices and shortages are happening at the same time how some zoning policies still lead to segregation and why many zoning changes that are environmentally friendly are unpopular with the public The Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion which have been edited for brevity and clarity Whats causing the current housing shortages and high housing costs in the US Jessica Trounstine Most metropolitan areas have seen housing shortages and skyrocketing prices over the last decade both for rentals and for mortgages And as those prices have gone up tax assessments have also gone up leading to higher property tax bills So the total amount of money that residents are paying for their housing is higher than it used to be When households pay more than of their income toward housing the census calls those households cost burdened And according to some recent data more than a third of households in the US are cost burdened and the figures are even higher for renters than for owners In some metropolitan areas greater than of renters are cost burdened How do local governments influence housing availability Jessica Trounstine Local governments can make it difficult to build housing which contributes in a fundamental way to housing shortages and skyrocketing prices They do things like charge high fees for development or put in place cumbersome review processes They can implement historical overlays or create openspace requirements But the most important way local governments affect housing shortages is by prohibiting density and allowing only singlefamily detached units to be built Many cities explicitly prohibit multifamily housing Anything from duplexes to highrises might be prohibited by a citys zoning or regulatory code They can also do things like have requirements for large setbacks from the street They can enact minimum lot sizes for every unit Because higher density and smaller housing units are less expensive these regulations that limit density are correlated with higher housing costs Many local landuse regulations have been in effect for a long time Why are they causing such problems now Jessica Trounstine Its true that these regulations were first used years ago but the current pattern of restrictive zoning did not really take off across the US until the s Landuse regulations tend to get layered over time Once a local government enacts landuse regulations they dont tend to roll them back So over time landuse regulations frequently get more and more exclusionary At the same time population has increased in major metropolitan areas for a variety of different reasons But housing development has slowed The market gets squeezed over time It is only in recent decades that weve really seen the confluence of all of these events so that even the price of housing for middleincome families can be very high How have zoning and landuse policies contributed to racial segregation Jessica Trounstine Segregation for many decades was driven predominantly by private market decisions racial steering blockbusting restrictive covenants and violence even to defend the color line But those tactics became at least technically illegal in the middle of the th century through court cases state laws and the federal Fair Housing Act of Restrictive zoning essentially arose to take the place of these kinds of tactics The US is much more segregated today than it would be if it werent for restrictive zoning On top of that restrictive zoning freezes in place segregation patterns that were created by overt racist actions decades ago We are about twice as segregated as we would otherwise be if we didnt have these kinds of regulations in place What strategies can municipalities use to address housing shortages and segregation Jessica Trounstine They can think about having all kinds of housing in every neighborhood all forms of housing to appeal to different kinds of people at different income levels They can do things like eliminate parking minimums and expand height restrictions Even more dramatically they can create public funds for lowincome developments What strategies make zoning and landuse reforms more effective Jessica Trounstine No single reform can work on its own Simply allowing duplexes to be built is frequently not enough But we do know that packages of reforms can work together You can permit duplexes but also be attentive to floorarea ratios and minimum lot sizes at the same time And addressing all of these different regulatory restrictions in some way can expand opportunity in the housing market There is also evidence that something happening in California called the builders remedy is working to increase development It allows developers to overrule essentially local regulations because of statelevel policy Some of my work also shows that lawsuits can be effective at addressing segregation patterns and longstanding regulatory constriction in the housing market How do zoning and landuse decisions affect the environment Jessica Trounstine Sprawl or expanding development farther and farther away from population density is in itself harmful to the environment It causes long commutes and changes the built environment in ways that can be costly for the environment Increasing density pulling people back toward the center is an environmentally friendly kind of policy What is the connection between zoning reforms and gentrification Jessica Trounstine It is true historically that when neighborhoods witness economic and racial transition marginalized communities are harmed in the process So one response to the concerns about gentrification is to ensure that marginalized communities are at the table and participating in the conversations about the built environment and about development Whats not clear in the gentrification research more generally is whether new development causes gentrification And so before we limit

Sometimes sellers pay closing costs but increase the sale price on the home Often closing costs are simply rolled into the total loan amount racking up interest for the life of the loan Borrowers who

allitems index increased percent over the past year before seasonal adjustment compared with Februarys month jump of percent Despite the uptick though inflation is still substantially lower than its high point of percent in the summer of Progress has been made on inflation down significantly from the peak says Mark Hamrick Bankrates senior economic analyst But it is happening at too slow of a pace to satisfy With the hotterthanexpected CPI notions of a nearterm rate cut by the Federal Reserve are going up in smoke Mark Hamrick Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst The Fed has indicated that rate cuts would be coming at some point this year though when has not been specified and cuts happening anytime soon seems less likely now With the hotterthanexpected CPI notions of a nearterm rate cut by the Federal Reserve are going up in smoke Hamrick says The battle against inflation has not yet been won and the Federal Reserve cannot yet declare mission accomplished Heres a peek into how inflation affects the housing market The housing market and inflation The shelter category which includes housing costs continues to be a major contributor to the CPIs monthly allitems increase It rose percent from last month and percent yearoveryear combined the shelter and gasoline indexes accounted for more than half of the monthly allitems increase in March Nationally CoreLogics most recent homeprice analysis reports that home prices rose percent from January to January o It forecasts that price growth will continue through the spring real estate season and beyond though perhaps not at quite as fast a pace US annual home price growth strengthened to percent in January said Selma Hepp CoreLogics chief economist in a statement And while the acceleration continues to reflect the residual impact of strong appreciation in early the annual rate of growth is expected to taper off in coming months Meanwhile Fannie Maes latest Home Purchase Sentiment Index HPSI decreased by points in March to with more than threequarters of respondents percent saying they believe its a bad time to buy a home That negative attitude is likely tied to todays mortgage rates which have eased a bit since hitting the percent mark in October but remain stubbornly elevated despite lower inflation The current average year fixed mortgage rate is percent according to Bankrates most recent data Lawrence Yun chief economist of the National Association of Realtors NAR foresees things calming down by endofyear Mortgage rates will be bouncy weektoweek but will most likely settle toward percent by the year end he said in a statement A big wildcard this year involves the questions associated with what happens with mortgage rates and the supply of homes for sale says Hamrick If we see a continued and more substantial drop in mortgage rates that could in turn compel more current owners to move putting their homes on the market Ultimately that could ease some of the upward pressure on home prices which would undo some of the damage inflicted on housing affordability over the past several years What it means for buyers and sellers Among these decidedly mixed signals should you buy a home now or wait What about selling your home now For homebuyers Low inventory remains a problem for potential buyers across the country According to the most recent existing home sales data from NAR the country had a month supply of housing inventory in February still significantly below the to months that would be needed for a balanced market Its OK to wait things out instead of buying now to beat further increases especially if youre a firsttime homebuyer While youd be putting off building equity you might find youre in a better position to buy in the future as the market cools and your income can potentially grow Even when inflation does come down on a consistent basis it doesnt mean prices falling it just means prices not rising as fast Greg McBride Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Even when inflation does come down on a consistent basis it doesnt mean prices falling it just means prices not rising as fast says Greg McBride CFA Bankrates chief financial analyst For homebuyers a more modest pace of appreciation or even a period of stagnant home prices can allow for incomes to grow further Rather than stretching too much now you may be able to buy a bit more comfortably in a couple of years if your income growth outpaces home price growth But there are no guarantees That said life circumstances might require you to buy a home now regardless of market trends and thats as good a reason as any Just make sure you plan to stay in the home for long enough to come out ahead when you eventually sell For home sellers The ongoing housing shortage may provide an opportunity for sellers to get a better price for their homes This is good news but keep in mind that if you then need to buy a new home the tables will turn and youll be subject to the same circumstances and high mortgage rates as other buyers And remember location matters The nationwide median homesale price was in February according to NAR but prices vary greatly from one area to the next So depending on where you live you could find fewer takers or need to come down on price Homebuying tips when prices are high If youre set on buying soon here are a few ways you can stretch your housing budget,The

Labor Statistics released April The allitems index increased percent over the past year before seasonal adjustment compared with Februarys month jump of percent Despite the uptick though inflation is still substantially lower than its high point of percent in the summer of Progress has been made on inflation down significantly from the peak says Mark Hamrick Bankrates senior economic analyst But it is happening at too slow of a pace to satisfy With the hotterthanexpected CPI notions of a nearterm rate cut by the Federal Reserve are going up in smoke Mark Hamrick Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst The Fed has indicated that rate cuts would be coming at some point this year though when has not been specified and cuts happening anytime soon seems less likely now With the hotterthanexpected CPI notions of a nearterm rate cut by the Federal Reserve are going up in smoke Hamrick says The battle against inflation has not yet been won and the Federal Reserve cannot yet declare mission accomplished Heres a peek into how inflation affects the housing market The housing market and inflation The shelter category which includes housing costs continues to be a major contributor to the CPIs monthly allitems increase It rose percent from last month and percent yearoveryear combined the shelter and gasoline indexes accounted for more than half of the monthly allitems increase in March Nationally CoreLogics most recent homeprice analysis reports that home prices rose percent from January to January o It forecasts that price growth will continue through the spring real estate season and beyond though perhaps not at quite as fast a pace US annual home price growth strengthened to percent in January said Selma Hepp CoreLogics chief economist in a statement And while the acceleration continues to reflect the residual impact of strong appreciation in early the annual rate of growth is expected to taper off in coming months Meanwhile Fannie Maes latest Home Purchase Sentiment Index HPSI decreased by points in March to with more than threequarters of respondents percent saying they believe its a bad time to buy a home That negative attitude is likely tied to todays mortgage rates which have eased a bit since hitting the percent mark in October but remain stubbornly elevated despite lower inflation The current average year fixed mortgage rate is percent according to Bankrates most recent data Lawrence Yun chief economist of the National Association of Realtors NAR foresees things calming down by endofyear Mortgage rates will be bouncy weektoweek but will most likely settle toward percent by the year end he said in a statement A big wildcard this year involves the questions associated with what happens with mortgage rates and the supply of homes for sale says Hamrick If we see a continued and more substantial drop in mortgage rates that could in turn compel more current owners to move putting their homes on the market Ultimately that could ease some of the upward pressure on home prices which would undo some of the damage inflicted on housing affordability over the past several years What it means for buyers and sellers Among these decidedly mixed signals should you buy a home now or wait What about selling your home now For homebuyers Low inventory remains a problem for potential buyers across the country According to the most recent existing home sales data from NAR the country had a month supply of housing inventory in February still significantly below the to months that would be needed for a balanced market Its OK to wait things out instead of buying now to beat further increases especially if youre a firsttime homebuyer While youd be putting off building equity you might find youre in a better position to buy in the future as the market cools and your income can potentially grow Even when inflation does come down on a consistent basis it doesnt mean prices falling it just means prices not rising as fast Greg McBride Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Even when inflation does come down on a consistent basis it doesnt mean prices falling it just means prices not rising as fast says Greg McBride CFA Bankrates chief financial analyst For homebuyers a more modest pace of appreciation or even a period of stagnant home prices can allow for incomes to grow further Rather than stretching too much now you may be able to buy a bit more comfortably in a couple of years if your income growth outpaces home price growth But there are no guarantees That said life circumstances might require you to buy a home now regardless of market trends and thats as good a reason as any Just make sure you plan to stay in the home for long enough to come out ahead when you eventually sell For home sellers The ongoing housing shortage may provide an opportunity for sellers to get a better price for their homes This is good news but keep in mind that if you then need to buy a new home the tables will turn and youll be subject to the same circumstances and high mortgage rates as other buyers And remember location matters The nationwide median homesale price was in February according to NAR but prices vary greatly from one area to the next So depending on where you live you could find fewer takers or need to come down on price Homebuying tips when prices are high If youre set on buying soon here are a few ways you can stretch your housing budget

their own version of this calculus It can be cheaper and more appealing to stay in their current large house than to sell it and move to something smaller This doesnt only affect younger buyers Youve got a pure housing mismatch for older homeowners They are mismatched physically or functionally with the house that theyre in says Gary Engelhardt an economist at Syracuse University who studies aging and housing markets Thats because its multifloor living Its stairs Its also other upkeep Engelhardt says thats a serious concern because it can can lead to things like falls And falls can be very devastating could have very devastating health consequences especially for the oldest old he says In general we would like to have older homeowners matched with their housing in a much better way than we currently have So what could be done Engelhardt says there are basically two policy approaches to deal with whats happening First he says is to provide subsidies or tax credits for home modifications that allow older adults to age in the homes they have While that could make seniors current housing safer it doesnt put those houses back into the market Second encourage building housing thats well suited to older Americans Engelhardt says You promote the construction of new residential units that are going to be ADA compliant that are going to have universal design and all the types of features that lend themselves to a better match of functionality at older ages For instance the government could create a tax credit to encourage developers to build accessible housing akin to the Low Income Housing Tax Credit that incentivizes building affordable housing Jenny Schuetz a housing policy expert at the Brookings Institution says in trying to incentivize older adults to move out of homes that are now too large for them different tools are needed depending on their geography and financial resources For instance a lowerincome homeowner of a deteriorating row house might be willing to a swap for a newer smaller apartment in an elevator building if there was a program for that But longtime California homeowners whove seen their property values skyrocket would likely require a different approach Schuetz says There Proposition strictly limits increases in property taxes so that many longtime homeowners pay taxes on a small fraction of their homes value That created its own lockin effect though a recent rule change allows those over age to keep their lower tax rate if they buy and move into a home of equal or lesser value Building more housing thats attractive to seniors There are other policy changes that could make it easier to build housing for different life stages and thereby entice boomers to downsize I think one of the things that we know to be true is that older adults want to be able to age in their communities says Danielle Arigoni managing director for Policy and Solutions at National Housing Trust Thats where they already have friends and neighbors doctors and bus routes they know familiarity that makes aging in their community possible Enlarge this image toggle caption Jordan VonderhaarBloomberg via Getty Images Jordan VonderhaarBloomberg via Getty Images But many areas including neighborhoods where a lot of baby boomers live have zoning that only allows singlefamily homes That means when older adults decide their current homes are too big they basically have to move out of their neighborhoods People want to be able to age in their communities but there are very few options available for people who do want to do that but want to downsize Arigoni says So if cities and states want to encourage more rightsizing they could change their zoning rules to allow more types of housing in all neighborhoods Cities across the country are already working to change their zoning rules for reasons including boosting supply and lowering housing costs Municipalities can also allow and encourage accessory dwelling units ADUs secondary dwellings like backyard cottages or basement apartments Arigoni says these offer lots of advantages for older adults For instance ADUs can be built all one level with no steps at all The homeowners can move into the new smaller ADU on their property and make money renting the larger house allowing them to stay in the neighborhood they love while adding a home to the rental market The extra space can also provide housing for caregivers or family members Another way to unlock supply in lowerdensity neighborhoods is to allow homeowners with large lots to split them

a countybycounty examination of Kentuckys current housing supply This summer KHC and Bowen will release a fiveyear projection of the housing supply gap based on population trends jobs growth housing starts and other data An analysis like this is essential said Winston Miller KHCs executive director and chief executive officer By identifying the gaps now we can take corrective action as an organization and as a state to provide better affordable housing solutions for our residents The Housing Supply Gap Analysis uncovered housing shortages in Kentuckys counties and Area Development Districts as of Detailed data available at kyhousingsupplygaporg shows Kentucky has a gap of rental units forsale units The gap is manifesting in a variety of ways There are fewer rental and forsale properties on the market Home and rent prices are increasing causing middleincome and lowincome Kentuckians to compete for the same units A January Urban Institute study backs this theory It showed that throughout the United States a lack of housing supply has caused home prices and rents to increase The housing supply shortage is Kentuckys most urgent housing issue said Wendy Smith KHCs deputy executive director of housing programs Its impacting middleincome Kentuckians and poor Kentuckians alike Increasing our housing supply is key to increasing homeownership rates lowering housing costs and reducing housing instability and homelessness The housing shortage impacts every county and every income level All counties experienced a gap in and some rural counties had a larger disparity in proportion to their population While those in the lower income brackets had more difficulty finding housing there were gaps along the continuum impacting people at all income levels The webinar was the first step in a communal effort KHC along with the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and Kentucky League of Cities have been studying the need for additional housing in the state Armed with this data

population grew from to but its housing stock increased by only Various sources have estimated an existing shortage of approximately homes Furthermore in Arizona recorded an alltime low average household size of individuals with having just one or two people With smaller households more homes would be needed even if Arizona hadnt gained nearly residents since There is evidence that strict

construction of the most expensive housing singleunit detached homes often with large lots and substantial parking requirements Conversely housing options such as duplexes townhomes apartment buildings and those with less parking typically offer more affordable rental rates and sales prices than singleunit detached homes However local zoning codes that limit where multifamily housing can be built or the number of homes per acre have made it difficult to develop lowercost housing For example the Morrison Institute at Arizona State University has noted that in Tucson multifamily housing can be built only on of the land Similarly Phoenixs general plan allows only lowdensity housing of no more than five homes per acre in many areas Certain US jurisdictions have revised their zoning codes to tackle housing shortages curb cost escalation and make homeownership more accessible Notable examples include Minneapolis New Rochelle New York Portland Oregon and Tysons Virginia A Pew analysis found that zoning reforms in these jurisdictions which are also growing have enabled far more housing than the national average while mitigating the growth of rental prices By contrast in Arizonas cities and towns rents have surged over the past six years See Figure,Restrictive Zoning Is Raising Housing Costs and Homelessness in Arizona The Pew Charitable Trusts Arizona policymakers like their peers in other states are considering how to respond to a nationwide housing shortage that is pushing rents and housing costs to record levels From August to August rental prices across Arizona surged by with even higher percentages in Tucson Mesa Glendale and Phoenix Although Arizona has long been known for its affordability of Phoenixarea renters in multifamily housing are now costburdened spending or more of income on rent Spiking costs hurt homebuyers too The monthly cost of homeownership excluding the increase in interest rates for the average home in Arizona increased by from in August to in August And for firsttime homebuyers in Arizona a family earning would have been able to afford the monthly mortgage payment on an average entrylevel home in but a family would have to earn to afford the monthly payment for the same home this year Whats driving Arizonas steep increase in housing costs Studies show that rental prices rise faster when there is a scarcity of available homes as low vacancy rates intensify competition for available units Its the same in the forsale market where shortages cause prices to climb swiftly The monthly inventory of homes for sale

Sherrod Brown,housing costs,WASHINGTON DC Today US Senator Sherrod Brown DOH Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs urged Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell ahead of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting to lower interest rates early this year in order to lower housing costs and support workers and families who are feeling the burden of high prices In a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Brown outlined how higher interest rates are burdening consumers through higher housing costs and stalled small business growth Brown also emphasized the underlying cause of higher pricescorporate pricegouging For working Americans and small businesses who already feel the crush of inflation higher housing costs and reduced access to credit will only make it worse Keeping interest rates high will be detrimental to American workers and their families and do little to bring down prices or promote moderate economic growth said Senator Brown While more must be done to address the fact that costs remain too high it is becoming increasingly evident that restrictive monetary policy is no longer the right tool for combatting inflation and I urge the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy early this year Brown has long warned the Federal Reserve of the impact of a high interest rate on consumers At last Junes Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress Brown warned Chair Powell of the dangers of continued interest rate hikes on consumers while corporations continue to rake in record profits You can read the full letter here and below Dear Chair Powell Its the responsibility of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System the Federal Reserve or Fed and its Federal Open Market Committee FOMC to maintain full employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates Accordingly it is your responsibility to set monetary policy that puts our country on a trajectory of both balanced growth and economic opportunity Working families and small businesses have too much to lose if the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates Even with recent wage gains outpacing inflation the cost of living is far too high for most Americans Increased costs of goods and services including food housing and childcare have stretched family budgets making it harder for Americans to keep up with the costs and save money Inflations burden is not felt equally by all higher prices for housing food and transportation disproportionately hurt middle and workingclass families who spend more of their budget on these essentials At the December FOMC meeting Several participants assessed that healing in supply chains and labor supply was largely complete and therefore that continued progress in reducing inflation may need to come mainly from further softening in product and labor demand with restrictive monetary policy continuing to play a central role Because monetary policy operates on a lag keeping interest rates elevated will continue to apply downward pressure on the labor market and wages and drive up mortgage costs while doing nothing to tackle the cause of continued high prices When the Fed justifies higher interest rates for the sake of weakening demand that is in effect a euphemism for suppressing wages and job creation The burden of attaining price stability should not fall on the backs of workers and homebuyers Many of the price increases we see now can be attributed to corporations increasing prices to boost alreadyhigh profits and executive compensation even higher Chief UBS Economist Paul Donovan has described the current bout of inflation as being the result of companies taking advantage of circumstances to expand their profit margins When external events temporarily raised production costs companies raised prices however once production costs normalized companies kept prices high raising their profit margins The most recent data for shows that more than half of inflation was caused by ballooning corporate profits and the majority of companies plan to keep prices higher in At the peak of inflation corporate profits increased nearly percent These fatter profit margins have gone into the pockets of CEOs and wealthy shareholders not the workers powering our economy Despite record profits the share of corporate profits paid out to workers through higher wages has declined To lower costs for all Americans we must address inflations root causes without undercutting economic growth Monetary policy does nothing to address the underlying cause of higher prices namely corporate pricegouging but it does undermine economic growth Higher rates are locking Americans out of the two primary means for building wealthbuying a home and starting or growing a small business Higher rates hurt prospective home buyers I hear from so many Ohioans that they feel trapped those who rent feel like theyll never be able to afford to buy and those who already own their homes feel like they will never be able to afford a larger one if they decide to grow their family Prices have been too high for too long for both renters and homebuyers across the country and these challenges have only grown more acute as interest rates have stayed elevated For prospective home buyers the same mortgage for a home purchased today costs nearly double what it did in Higher rates have also given corporations an advantage over consumers in the housing market As consumers face elevated interest rates many of the biggest real estate investors have access to cheaper Wall Street financing allowing them to buy up real estate with allcash offers based on financing costs a working family could never get As a result institutional investors including private equity and SP companies are buying up formerly affordable manufactured housing communities and affordable singlefamily homes in far too many communities Homeownership is the primary means for workingclass and middleclass families to acquire wealth and higher interest rates are making it harder for them to afford a mortgage to purchase a home denying them the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth Higher interest rates are hindering growth in the housing supply High interest rates are also contributing to high housing costs by exacerbating our yearslong housing shortage as they limit affordable housing providers ability to finance new construction at price points that workers can afford As a result housing production remains thousands of units behind each year in communities across the country and renters are forced to pay high prices month after month In a record half of renters were paying more than they could afford for housing pushing their ability to save for a down payment further out of reach If affordable housing providers remain unable to build new units that these workers can afford housing costs will only continue to contribute to rising prices Higher interest rates stall small business growth Tightened credit conditions are making it difficult for small businesses to thrive Keeping the policy rate higher for longer has driven up the cost of credit for small business loans Today a small business seeking to take out a loan will pay on average in interest For the small businesses who have already taken out loans higher rates will increase their

Sherrod Brown,housing costs,WASHINGTON DC Today US Senator Sherrod Brown DOH Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs delivered the following opening statement at todays hearing entitled The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress Sen Browns remarks as prepared for delivery follow The Fed has immense power in shaping our economy Your job is clear promote stable prices and maximum employment Today the cost of living is still far too expensive for most Americans The Fed only has one tool available to fight those high prices interest rates And that tool does nothing to address the real cause for why costs remain too high corporations price gouging to boost their profits and make their shareholders richer High rates dont force corporations to lower their prices but high interest rates are raising housing costs hindering wage growth and stifling small businesses Now is the time for the Fed to decide if it is going to make good on its commitment to workers and to their families by lowering interest rates and protecting our financial system from Wall Street executives who have used their wealth and power to influence economic policy and to avoid accountability for their risky bets Keeping rates too high for too long strangles the economy No one wants this It makes it harder for small businesses to expand and hire more workers undermining job creation Higher rates also stifle overdue investments that are creating highquality goodpaying jobs and that are necessary for us to remain the most competitive and innovative economy in the world And high interest rates are raising housing costs higher and higher for families who were already facing a tough market with too few options and too high prices I hear from so many Ohioans who feel trapped those who rent feel like theyll never be able to afford to buy And those who already own their homes feel like they will never be able to afford a larger one if they decide to grow their family If theyre fortunate enough to have an interest rate from a couple of years ago they dont want to give it up That limits their choices and it limits the housing supply And by driving up construction costs higher rates make it even harder to build new apartments and homes so we have even less supply at exactly the same time when its harder to afford a mortgage Families are stuck delaying the purchase of their first home and renting for longer And that cycle drives rents up even further Americans are paying a steep price for high interest rates And continued high rates are not going to make life less expensive for workers and their families We know why prices are high years after supply chains have improved Its the same cause of so many of the problems in our economy Corporations want bigger profits to reward their executives In at the peak of inflation corporate profits soared to historic levels And you know where those profits went right into the pockets of their top executives That same year the largest multinational corporations gave out nearly one and a half trillion dollars in stock buybacks and dividends Americans today pay more for groceries than they have in years And Ohioans are paying for corporations executive bonuses and stock buybacks every time they go to the grocery store And the biggest corporations are always finding new ways to charge people more to increase their profits Fast food restaurants and big stores are experimenting with electronic price tags so they can change prices constantly making it easier to sneak prices up little by little and making it harder for people to comparison shop and find the store with the lowest price And many companies increase their profits by charging more for less the media has started calling it shrinkflation Your bottle of Gatorade used to be ounces now its ounces but the price hasnt gone down If anything its gone up a little bit Its why I introduced legislation that would stop that kind of deceptive practice Thats the kind of solution we need to take on corporate price gouging and it has nothing to do with higher interest rates The Fed doesnt only set monetary policy You also make the rules that keep our banking system sound and consumers money safe We have had some positive developments since the last time you testified in June like the update to the Community Reinvestment Act rule Chair Powell thank you for your work on this this took years of listening carefully to all stakeholders and was long overdue Well be watching to make sure you implement this quickly so that banks are fulfilling the purpose of the Community Reinvestment Act You also issued an updated capital requirements proposal called Basel III Strong capital requirements are how we ensure that if Wall Streets bets dont pay off shareholders and investors are on the hook not taxpayers We need these guardrails in place I urge you to remain committed to protecting the public despite the massive amounts of money big banks and their lobbyists are spending to try to kill these taxpayer protections Lets finish the job and finalize Basel III Last years bank failures also demonstrate the dangers of letting the banks chip away at rules and oversight Its entirely predictable bankers desperate to increase their alreadymassive profits take big risks that undermine our economy And when things go wrong the bank executives come to regulators with their hands out accepting no responsibility Its why Congress must finish the job and pass our bipartisan RECOUP Act it passed this committee to to hold senior bank executives accountable when they gamble with customers money When the biggest banks exercise special privilege they do so at the peril of our broader economy And we know thats the source of so much thats wrong in this country big corporations using their power and influence to write the rules of our economy to the benefit of them and their executives and their investors and to the detriment of everyone else Thats why I stand up for workers and their right to organize Its why I stand up to take on the railroads and the drug companies and the biggest banks and corporations who time and time again try to rewrite the rules to increase their profit margins Chair Powell I look forward to hearing from you today how the Fed will work to promote an economy where everyone who

also issued an updated capital requirements proposal called Basel III Strong capital requirements are how we ensure that if Wall Streets bets dont pay off shareholders and investors are on the hook not taxpayers We need these guardrails in place I urge you to remain committed to protecting the public despite the massive amounts of money big banks and their lobbyists are spending to try to kill these taxpayer protections Lets finish the job and finalize Basel III Last years bank failures also demonstrate the dangers of letting the banks chip away at rules and oversight Its entirely predictable bankers desperate to increase their alreadymassive profits take big risks that undermine our economy And when things go wrong the bank executives come to regulators with their hands out accepting no responsibility Its why Congress must finish the job and pass our bipartisan RECOUP Act it passed this committee to to hold senior bank executives accountable when they gamble with customers money When the biggest banks exercise special privilege they do so at the peril of our broader economy And we know thats the source of so much thats wrong in this country big corporations using their power and influence to write the rules of our economy to the benefit of them and their executives and their investors and to the detriment of everyone else Thats why I stand up for workers and their right to organize Its why I stand up to take on the railroads and the drug companies and the biggest banks and corporations who time and time again try to rewrite the rules to increase their profit margins Chair Powell I look forward to hearing from you today how the Fed will work to promote an economy where everyone who wants a good job can find one

rates rise both buyers and sellers are less likely to enter the market And in the case of Bostons wealthiest suburbs that has meant some of the highest priced properties have become a tougher sell Over that year the median sales price of singlefamily homes fell in Belmont down percent Brookline percent and Hingham percent among other places all tony communities where high home values often feel the most insulated from turns in the market In some communities such as Lincoln prices dropped by double figures according to the Warren Group a real estate analytics firm In some of Bostons wealthiest suburbs where McMansions are seemingly built more often than apartments something bizarre happened between and Home prices actually dropped Get Globe Magazine An engaging blend of awardwinning narrative journalism opinion lifestyle travel recipes and advice Enter Email Sign Up Its a math issue that is fundamentally a function of interest rates says Sage Jankowitz a realtor with REMAX Destiny in Cambridge In markets where you have super high price points already the higher interest rates are a killer The numbers just dont work Advertisement The math realtors say works like this Prices havent dropped everywhere in fact in most cases they climbed last year in most Greater Boston communities because no matter how high interest rates get firsttime buyers are still desperate for a home That means they are willing to stomach higher monthly costs as long as they can afford a homes price tag Most homes sold in wealthier communities however are not going to firsttime buyers because they are too expensive That means the people buying those properties are in most cases upgrading from one home to another and can stand to wait for interest rates to drop Advertisement When you add high mortgage rates on top of the multimilliondollar price tags in highend suburbs the math makes less sense even for wealthy buyers So fewer homes particularly higherend homes are selling in those areas causing price points to drop Throughout most of Greater Boston the seemingly endless upward march of home prices continued last year The median price for a singlefamily home in the region was according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors a spike from five years earlier That is of course thanks to the regions severe housing shortage which seems to get worse every year But you can see how in some wealthy communities that trend reversed even if temporarily In Cambridge where Jankowitz works he says hes seen homes sell in recent months for almost a million dollars less than what they were listed for He notes however that homes and multifamilies in some of the citys most popular neighborhoods such as Central and Harvard Squares are still fetching big price tags and are often sold in a matter of days Across Cambridge The Warren Group found that singlefamily home prices fell by about percent a small drop but a significant one in a tight market One of the most pronounced shifts was in Lincoln where The Warren Group found prices fell more than percent in The medianpriced singlefamily home there sold for last year down more than from Advertisement Still its not as if homes there really became more affordable Terry Perlmutter a realtor with Barrett Sothebys in Lincoln was surprised to see the drop but emphasized that it wasnt as if values fell across all homes in town The drop in median price was a factor of just homes bought there over the course of a year Lincoln Perlmutter says is still an expensive hypercompetitive market to buy in But with higher interest rates fewer people were willing to sell or buy and the homes that did sell were most likely sold by people who needed to move on which she says would explain why the sale prices were slightly less People with higherend homes have generally been more willing to wait out higher interest rates Perlmutter adds Its also a broader inventory issue she says Maybe the folks in those higherend homes were thinking about downsizing and were looking around the region and because theres not really much inventory anywhere right now couldnt find anywhere that fit their standards So they stayed That trend Jankowitz says will begin to correct itself when interest rates fall whenever that is People still want to buy homes people still want to sell he says I think when we see mortgage rates dip

Hingham percent among other places all tony communities where high home values often feel the most insulated from turns in the market In some communities such as Lincoln prices dropped by double figures according to the Warren Group a real estate analytics firm In some of Bostons wealthiest suburbs where McMansions are seemingly built more often than apartments something bizarre happened between and Home prices actually dropped Get Globe Magazine An engaging blend of awardwinning narrative journalism opinion lifestyle travel recipes and advice Enter Email Sign Up Its a math issue that is fundamentally a function of interest rates says Sage Jankowitz a realtor with REMAX Destiny in Cambridge In markets where you have super high price points already the higher interest rates are a killer The numbers just dont work Advertisement The math realtors say works like this Prices havent dropped everywhere in fact in most cases they climbed last year in most Greater Boston communities because no matter how high interest rates get firsttime buyers are still desperate for a home That means they are willing to stomach higher monthly costs as long as they can afford a homes price tag Most homes sold in wealthier communities however are not going to firsttime buyers because they are too expensive That means the people buying those properties are in most cases upgrading from one home to another and can stand to wait for interest rates to drop Advertisement When you add high mortgage rates on top of the multimilliondollar price tags in highend suburbs the math makes less sense even for wealthy buyers So fewer homes particularly higherend homes are selling in those areas causing price points to drop Throughout most of Greater Boston the seemingly endless upward march of home prices continued last year The median price for a singlefamily home in the region was according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors a spike from five years earlier That is of course thanks to the regions severe housing shortage which seems to get worse every year But you can see how in some wealthy communities that trend reversed even if temporarily In Cambridge where Jankowitz works he says hes seen homes sell in recent months for almost a million dollars less than what they were listed for He notes however that homes and multifamilies in some of the citys most popular neighborhoods such as Central and Harvard Squares are still fetching big price tags and are often sold in a matter of days Across Cambridge The Warren Group found that singlefamily home prices fell by about percent a small drop but a significant one in a tight market One of the most pronounced shifts was in Lincoln where The Warren Group found prices fell more than percent in The medianpriced singlefamily home there sold for last year down more than from Advertisement Still its not as if homes there really became more affordable Terry Perlmutter a realtor with Barrett Sothebys in Lincoln was surprised to see the drop but emphasized that it wasnt as if values fell across all homes in town The drop in median price was a factor of just homes bought there over the course of a year Lincoln Perlmutter says is still an expensive hypercompetitive market to buy in But with higher interest rates fewer people were willing to sell or buy and the homes that did sell were most likely sold by people who needed to move on which she says would explain why the sale prices were slightly less People with higherend homes have generally been more willing to wait out higher interest rates Perlmutter adds Its also a broader inventory issue she says Maybe the folks in those higherend homes were thinking about downsizing and were looking around the region and because theres not really much inventory anywhere right now couldnt find anywhere that fit their standards So they stayed That trend Jankowitz says will begin to correct itself when interest rates fall whenever that is People still want to buy homes people still want to sell he says I think when we see mortgage rates dip youre going to see the market get moving again very quickly There wont be any more price drops when that happens Explore the Top Spots

is April to May As a borrower it doesnt make much sense to try to time your rate in this market Our best advice is to buy when youre financially ready and can afford the home you want regardless of current interest rates Remember that youre not stuck with your mortgage rate forever If rates drop significantly homeowners can always refinance later on to cut costs Historic mortgage rates Important years for rates The longterm average for mortgage rates is just under percent Thats according to Freddie Mac records going back to But mortgage rates can move a lot from year to year And some years have seen much bigger moves than others Lets look at a few examples to show how rates often buck conventional wisdom and move in unexpected ways The alltime high for mortgage rates was the worst year

some of was higher and the entire year averaged out at for a year mortgage The surprise mortgage rate dropoff In many economists predicted that mortgage rates would top percent That turned out to be wrong In fact rates dropped in The average mortgage rate went from in to in At the monthly payment for a home loan was Thats a savings of a month or a year when compared with the longterm average In it was thought mortgage rates couldnt go much lower But and proved that thinking wrong again The lowest year mortgage rates ever Rates plummeted in and in response to the Coronavirus pandemic By July the year fixed rate fell below for the first time And it kept falling to a new record low of just in January The average mortgage rate for that year was That year marked an incredibly appealing homeownership opportunity for firsttime homebuyers to enter the housing market It also resulted in a surge in refinancing activity among existing homeowners At the monthly payment for a home loan is not counting taxes and insurance Youd save a month or a year compared to the longterm average However recordlow rates were largely dependent on accommodating Covidera policies from the Federal Reserve Those measures were never meant to last And the more US and world economies recover from their Covid slump the higher interest rates are likely to go Mortgage rates spike Thanks to sharp inflation growth higher benchmark rates and a drawback on mortgage stimulus by the Fed mortgage rates spiked in According to Freddie Macs records the average year rate jumped from in January to a high of at the

meaningful recession mortgage rates could come back down somewhat Mortgage rates and tugofwar with inflation As the Federal Reserve continues its battle against inflation and edges closer to reaching its target mortgage rates have continued to indirectly climb higher Since the Federal Reserve began its rate hikes in March the benchmark interest rate has risen percentage points According to Freddie Macs records the average year rate reached during the initial week of increasing steadily to eventually land at in December The question arises where will mortgage rates ultimately settle next year US Federal Reserve officials expect to cut interest rates three times in This move could alleviate significant upward pressure on mortgage rates potentially leading to a more substantial rate decline Well have to wait and see if rates breach the much anticipated mark in A potential turning point ahead While last year saw rates soaring to unprecedented highs the year ahead is poised to be another turning point in the mortgage world At the January Federal Reserve meeting it was hinted that there could be three rate cuts rather than hikes anticipated for Most economists widely expect a decline

Mortgage Monitor report nearly half of the individuals who purchased homes last year stand to benefit from refinancing if rates drop to or lower Factors that affect your mortgage interest rate For the average homebuyer tracking mortgage rates helps reveal trends But not every borrower will benefit equally from todays competitive mortgage rates Home loans are personalized to the borrower Your credit score down payment loan type loan term and loan amount will affect your mortgage or refinance rate Its also possible to negotiate mortgage rates Discount points can provide a lower interest rate in exchange for paying cash upfront Lets look at some of these factors individually Credit score A credit score above will open more doors for lowinterestrate loans though some loan programs such as USDA FHA and VA loans can be available to sub borrowers If possible give yourself a few months or even a year to improve your credit score before borrowing You could save thousands of dollars through the life of the loan Down payment Higher down payments can shave your borrowing rate Most mortgages including FHA loans require at least or down And VA loans and USDA loans are available with zero down payment But if you can put or even down you might qualify for a conventional loan with low or no private mortgage insurance and seriously reduce your housing costs Loan type The type of mortgage loan you use will affect your interest rate However your loan type hinges on your credit score So these two factors are very intertwined For example with a credit score of you may qualify only for a governmentbacked loan such as an FHA mortgage FHA loans have low interest rates but come with mortgage insurance no matter how much money you put down A credit score of or higher might qualify you for a conventional loan and depending on your down payment and other factors potentially a lower rate Adjustablerate mortgages traditionally offer lower introductory interest rates compared to a year fixedrate mortgage However those rates are subject to change after the initial fixedrate period An initially low ARM rate could rise substantially after or years Loan term In this post weve tracked rates for year fixedrate mortgages But year fixedrate mortgages tend to have even lower borrowing rates With a year mortgage youd have a higher monthly payment because of the shorter loan term But throughout the life of the loan youd save a lot in interest charges If you took out a home loan with a year fixed rate of youd pay around in total interest over the life of the loan The same loan size with a year fixed rate of just would cost only in interest saving you around in total Loan amount Rates on unusually small mortgages a home loan for example tend to be higher than average rates because these loans are less profitable to the mortgage lender Rates on a jumbo mortgage are normally higher too because mortgage lenders have a higher risk of loss But jumbo loan rates have reversed course and stayed below conforming rates in creating great deals for jumbo loan borrowers Currently a jumbo mortgage is any loan amount over in most parts of the US Discount points A discount point can lower interest rates by about in exchange for upfront cash A discount point costs of the home loan amount For a loan a discount point would cost upfront However the borrower would recoup the upfront cost over time thanks to the savings earned by a lower interest rate Since interest payments play out over time a buyer who plans to sell the home or refinance within a couple of years should probably skip the discount points and pay a higher interest rate for a while Some rate quotes assume the home buyer will buy discount points so be sure to check before closing on the loan Other mortgage costs to keep in mind Remember that your mortgage rate is not the only number that affects your mortgage payment When youre estimating your home buying budget you also need to account for Down payment Closing costs Discount points optional Private mortgage insurance PMI or FHA mortgage insurance premiums Homeowners insurance Property taxes HOA dues if buying in a homeowners association When you get preapproved youll receive a document called a Loan Estimate that lists all these numbers clearly for comparison You can use your Loan Estimates to find the best overall deal on your mortgage not just the best interest rate You can also use a mortgage calculator with taxes insurance and HOA dues included to estimate your total mortgage payment and home buying budget When to lock your mortgage rate Keep an eye on daily rate changes But if you get a good mortgage rate quote today dont hesitate to lock it in Remember that average mortgage rates are only a general benchmark If you have good credit and strong personal finances theres a good chance youll get a lower rate than what you see in the news So check with a lender to see what you qualify for,Mortgage Rates Chart

sell the home or refinance within a couple of years should probably skip the discount points and pay a higher interest rate for a while Some rate quotes assume the home buyer will buy discount points so be sure to check before closing on the loan Other mortgage costs to keep in mind Remember that your mortgage rate is not the only number that affects your mortgage payment When youre estimating your home buying budget you also need to account for Down payment Closing costs Discount points optional Private mortgage insurance PMI or FHA mortgage insurance premiums Homeowners insurance Property taxes HOA dues if buying in a homeowners association When you get preapproved youll receive a document called a Loan Estimate that lists all these numbers clearly for comparison You can use your Loan Estimates to find the best overall deal on your mortgage not just the best interest rate You can also use a mortgage calculator with taxes insurance and HOA dues included to estimate your total mortgage payment and home buying budget When to lock your mortgage rate Keep an eye on daily rate changes But if you get a good mortgage rate quote today dont hesitate to lock it in Remember that average mortgage rates are only a general benchmark If you have good credit and strong personal finances theres a good chance youll get a lower rate than what you see in the news So check with a lender to see what you qualify for

News,housing costs,Housing prices are up Polls say Americans are worried and want elected officials to do something about it And few politicians seem to be hitting the campaign trail with a pitch to

issue its broadly salient several policy solutions have bipartisan support and its a real issue affecting peoples lives But there are challenges that make it lessthanideal campaign fodder I can think of a number of compelling reasons why if I were running for congressional seat I might not choose to talk about housing Einstein said Got questions about voting the primary elections KERA News has answers There are candidates running for Texas three open Congressional seats this year A review of their campaign websites shows just a handful mention housing among the issues theyre concerned about Thats also true for Republican Sen Ted Cruz and the top Democrats vying to replace him Some of the candidates dont list any priorities but most do Where housing affordability shows up its often in passing or as a general issue of concern Few talk housing in North Texas A few Democrats vying to replace Rep Colin Allred who is running for Senate raise housing The Democraticleaning nd Congressional District covers much of northeast Dallas County and bits of Collin and Denton Counties Most prominent is Brian Williams an ER doctor who calls for investing in affordable housing and fighting housing discrimination Chris Ponayiotou says hed pressure the Federal Reserve to drop interest rates and use antitrust laws to prevent investors from buying up large swaths of the housing market Zachariah Manning says hed ensure that our veterans and military have the healthcare housing and funding needed Allred in his bid for the Senate says he wants to expand Medicaid to cover senior assisted living and to expand housing for homeless veterans One of this opponents state Sen Roland Gutierrez notes the high cost of buying a home but doesnt offer specific solutions beyond building an economy that works for everyone Brandon Gill a Republican running the th Congressional District opines that housing is unaffordable but doesnt include specific policy solutions The district which covers much of Denton County all of Cooke County and some of Wise County is heavily Republican and is represented by Michael Burgess who is retiring And Trey Hunt a Democrat running in the th Congressional District which includes areas around west Fort Worth and Weatherford puts affordable housing for all at the top of his agenda and lays out a fairly robust argument for prioritizing government incentives to spur construction and expanding housing programs Hunt faces tough odds as a Democrat in a heavily Republican district represented by Rep Kay Granger who is retiring Why not to talk about housing Einstein pointed to three reasons why housing issues dont make good campaign fodder First policies to increase affordable housing arent as popular as they look because people often support them in the abstract but oppose them when they play out in their neighborhoods For example of Democrats and of Republicans favor expanding federal incentives to develop more housing that is affordable to lowerincome households the Bipartisan Policy Center found Theres bipartisan support for incentivizing cities to reform land use and zoning policies to allow for denser housing to be built and to increase public subsidies to build longterm housing for people experiencing homelessness But then when we actually ask people hey is it okay if we build an apartment building right down the street from you they uniformly will say No thank you we dont want that Einstein said That means actually following through on a campaign pledge to build more homes could face a political liability when they get built Second the lagtime for construction and development makes housing a lousy campaign issue Itll probably take five to ten years for policies to move the needle on the housing shortage even if they got passed tomorrow Einstein said Congressional elections are every two years And last Housing is really really complicated There are a mix of actors involved each with a variety of priorities And fixing the nations housing shortage and helping ensure people arent priced out of decent housing will require a mix of federal state and especially local policy changes she said I might not want to take responsibility for an issue over which I actually dont have a lot of control I cant control a lot of the zoning and land use and planning decisions that are ultimately going to dictate what housing gets built Daron Shaw a political science professor at the University of Texas Austin adds one more that the issue rarely gets ranked by voters as one of the most important issues facing the nation or state Now this could be a chicken and egg thing Political elites and public officials dont talk about something so the public is less likely to offer it up as a big issue so the politicians ignore it he said But whatever the origin point housing loses out to issues like the economy immigration education crime etc A changing tide This is despite increased action in Congress in some state capitals and in a lot of cities to increase the supply of homes and to help people struggling to afford their housing costs said Dennis Shea executive director of the Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center But few of those politicians seem to champion the issue on the campaign trail Id like to see a couple of people running for Congress hit this one hard Housing affordability And really make this the centerpiece of my campaign Shea said Nicole Nosek from Texans for Reasonable Solutions said in places like California politicians are more regularly facing questions from voters and constituents about how theyll address the housing shortage and affordability challenges Homes there are significantly more expensive and the state has grappled with widespread affordability problems for longer than Texas I would love to see politicians get ahead of this so lets not wait for it to be at San Francisco price of million dollars before they act And at that point some might say its too late said Nosek whose group backs policies to make it quicker and cheaper to build more homes that more people can afford in Texas Half of Texas renters are paying more for housing than they can afford And after years of climbing home prices homeownership is increasingly a pipe dream And the median price tag for a home in the DallasFort Worth area was almost In Austin where housing is the most expensive Nosek said politicians have been forced to talk more about the issue at least at the local level She thinks that is only likely to increase Whether its going to be this session or its going to be two sessions from now youre going to see Texans opting in to leaders who have solutions to these issues Nosek said Pew Research found of Americans are very or somewhat concerned about housing costs The Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult found of American adults think Congress should prioritize legislation to increase homebuilding and improve housing affordability Their polling shows a whole host of solutions have strong support among Democrats Republicans and independents Its percolating not from just lowerincome concern its really percolating up into the middleincome folks Shea said Einstein said the potential downside if housing issues become more politicized and politicians spar over them during campaigns is that solutions that currently enjoy broad bipartisan support solutions could take on partisan valences that make them harder to get passed I can point to both Democratic and Republican states that have passed really promising zoning reforms that preempt a lot of local control in ways that may do wonders for reducing exclusionary zoning she said And I think if this became a more hyperpartisan issue those kinds of

Pew Charitable Trusts,housing costs,A new analysis of rent prices and homelessness in American cities demonstrates the strong connection between the two homelessness is high in urban areas where rents are high and homelessness rises when rents rise To identify and illustrate the housing market dynamics driving these trends The Pew Charitable Trusts compared homelessness and rent data in and In recent years many metro areas in the US have seen stark increases in levels of homelessness along with fastrising rents At the same time some other locales that saw slow rent growth experienced declines in homelessness Media reports have highlighted increases in homelessness and the emergence of encampments in numerous cities including Austin Texas Fresno California Phoenix Arizona Raleigh North Carolina Sacramento California and Tucson Arizona But other urban areas where homelessness declined over the same periodsuch as in Chicago Houston Minneapolis and Philadelphiarecorded slower growth in rents than in the US overall A large body of academic research has consistently found that homelessness in an area is driven by housing costs whether expressed in terms of rents renttoincome ratios pricetoincome ratios or home prices Further changes in rents precipitate changes in rates of homelessness homelessness increases when rents rise by amounts that lowincome households cannot afford Similarly interventions to address housing costs by providing housing directly or through subsidies have been effective in reducing homelessness That makes sense if housing costs are the main driver of homelessness but not if other reasons are to blame Studies show that other factors have a much smaller impact on homelessness Much of the research looks at the variation in homelessness among geographies and finds that housing costs explain far more of the difference in rates of homelessness than variables such as substance use disorder mental health weather the strength of the social safety net poverty or economic conditions Some vulnerabilities strongly influence which people are susceptible to homelessness but research has repeatedly concluded that these factors play only a minor role in driving rates of homelessness compared with the role of housing costs For its analysis Pew reviewed the US Department of Housing and Urban Developments homelessness data from and and Apartment List rent data covering the same period In the six metro areas highlighted where homelessness rose sharply rents increased faster than the national average See Figure Over the same period the four urban areas featured that experienced declines in homelessness saw low rent growth In some areas the relationship between housing costs and rates of homelessness is less clear perhaps because of data volatility or the role played by other factors that influence homelessness But the strength and consistency of researchers findings over time indicate that these places are the exception and that the weak relationship may be temporary Recent Pew research indicates that cities that added to their housing supply in recent years typically by reforming their local zoning codes to allow more apartments to be built succeeded in keeping rent growth low On the other hand several areas in which homelessness spiked had added little to their local housing supply For example the Fresno and Tucson areas added just and respectively to their housing stock between and despite high demand for homes The Austin area meanwhile added to its housing stock despite its restrictive zoning code but that still fell short of its growth in households over that time With so many households seeking too few homes rents climbed Throughout the United States rents have reached alltime highs Half of renters nationwide now spend at least of their income on rent and a quarter spend at least As recently as the s when rents as a share of income were far lower homelessness was rare in the United States and housing was often available in buildings where individuals would rent private rooms but share kitchens bathrooms or common spaces These lowcost units helped stave off homelessness because someone earning low wages or receiving disability benefits could usually afford to rent a private room In the decades since zoning or building code restrictions in most cities prevented more of these units from being developed and city governments encouraged their conversion into other uses There are still places in the US where levels of homelessness are low either because those places have lowcost housing readily availablesuch as Mississippi where homelessness is times lower than Californiaor because they have rapidly added housing and made a concerted effort to reduce the ranks of residents without homes In Houston the rate of homelessness is times lower than it is in San Francisco even though Houstons population has grown more than San Franciscos in the past decade See Figure Looking at these markets helps to show how population growth generally does not explain growth in homelessness except in instances where there is not a sufficient increase in the housing supply Examples of that include Vermont and Maine both of which until recently have had very restrictive zoning that limited building more homes Each saw an influx of residents during the COVID pandemic and homelessness increased and in those states respectively from to The metro areas shown in Figure illustrate how research has found that increases in rents cause increases in homelessness Those shown in Figure exemplify the related but distinct finding from academic research that areas with high rents have high rates of homelessness The academic research has consistently found that allowing more homes to be built keeps housing costs down In tandem with the work showing that housing costs are the primary driver of homelessness the findings suggest that allowing more housing to be built whether subsidized or not can reduce homelessness What distinguishes places in the US with low levels of homelessness is that housing is more abundant relative to the demand and therefore costs less

How the Military's Basic Allowance for Housing Compares With Civilian Housing Costs - Congressional Budget Office,How the Military's Basic Allowance for Housing Compares With Civilian Housing Costs  Congressional Budget Office,"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiby5nb3YvcHVibGljYXRpb24vNjAwNjLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Congressional Budget Office,housing costs,CBO focused its analysis on civilians who were similar to enlisted military personnel with dependents at pay grade E from to Service members at that pay grade are typically between the ages of and and hold the rank of sergeant in the Army Marine Corps and Space Force staff sergeant in the Air Force or petty officer second class in the Navy They constitute one of the largest groups of BAH recipients In this report the Congressional Budget Office compares the kinds of housing that DoD defines as suitable for military personnel who receive BAH known as military housing standards with the housing choices made by two groups of civilians those with age and education profiles comparable to military personnel of each pay grade and those with comparable income CBO also compares the size of BAH payments which are derived from the military housing standards with the rental costs including utilities that comparable civilians pay The US military has provided room and board or allowances in lieu thereof to its personnel and their dependents for many decades Currently most service members on active duty are provided with housing through the basic allowance for housing BAH which is part of their cash compensation In fiscal year funding for all types of BAH was about billion in dollars percent of funding for the Department of Defenses DoDs military personnel accounts Retaining activeduty personnel depends in part on whether their compensation packagewhich includes the housing allowanceis sufficient to entice them to stay in the military All dollar values are expressed in dollars unless otherwise specified the most recent year of the American Community Survey ACS data that the Congressional Budget Office analyzed To remove the effects of inflation in housing costs reported in the ACS CBO adjusted housing rental prices using the consumer price index for rent of primary residence as described at httptinyurlcom umubw All other costs were adjusted using the gross domestic product price index as described in The Budget and Economic Outlook to February and published in full on CBOs website at wwwcbogovdatabudgeteconomicdata Unless this report indicates otherwise all years referred to are calendar years Occasionally the report refers to federal fiscal years which run from October to September and are designated by the calendar year in which they end How the Militarys Basic Allowance for Housing Compares With Civilian Housing Costs Summary About twothirds of military service members collect a taxfree housing allowance called the basic allowance for housing BAH that can be used to rent or purchase homes in the local community or to rent privately managed housing on military bases By law BAH rates must reflect the cost of adequate housing for civilians with similar income housing allowances are intended to cover percent of the combined rent and utility costs of suitable housing for service members regardless of the earnings of other household members Service members who live off base may choose to pay more than their BAH for housing or they may pay less and keep the extra pay Underpinning BAH rates are military housing standards which reflect what the Department of Defense DoD determines is suitable housingincluding the type of dwelling and number of bedroomsfor BAH recipients The housing standards are intended to generally reflect community living standards and are established on the basis of service members pay grades which reflect their rank and their family status whether or not they have a spouse or dependent children DoD annually surveys the rental costs of vacant housing that meets the standard for certain pay grades and family statuses in each geographic location around military facilities known as a military housing area or MHA and uses those costs as the basis for BAH rates for all recipients Between fiscal years and BAH funding more than doubled after removing the effects of inflation in rental housing prices In fiscal year funding for all types of BAH was about billion in dollars accounting for percent of funding for DoDs military personnel accounts Such increases in the cost of personnel may reduce the militarys ability to invest in other priorities such as training or weapons procurement But if housing allowances are not adequate service members wellbeing may be diminished and DoDs efforts to recruit and retain highquality personnel may be adversely affected In this report the Congressional Budget Office addresses two main questions How do the housing standards used to determine the monthly rates of BAH compare with the housing rented by similar civilians How do BAH rates compare with the rental costs that is rent and utility costs paid by similar civilians To answer those questions CBO looked at BAH payments and civilian housing choices for the period CBO analyzed the years immediately before the coronavirus pandemic because the pandemic affected the rental housing and labor markets in atypical ways as well as the Census Bureaus data collection efforts and the resulting data quality The agencys results suggest that on average BAH provided to military personnel was higher in some cases substantially higher than the rental costs that similar civilians pay However the difference between BAH and civilian rental costs varied considerably by location How Did CBO Define Similar Civilians CBO focused on civilians similar to enlisted service members on active duty with a pay grade of E who have dependents Es are one of the largest groups of service members who receive BAH payments They are typically between the ages of and are generally in their second or third enlistment period and hold the rank of sergeant in the Army Marine Corps and Space Force a staff sergeant in the Army or a petty officer second class in the Navy The agency defined similar civilians in two ways In the first CBO used demographic characteristics It identified civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of military personnel at various pay grades because those characteristics influence the choices people make across a spectrum of decisions and economic outcomes In the second CBO identified civilians with income similar to the cash compensation for service members by pay grade as measured by regular military compensation RMC Defining similar civilians in that way accords with the requirement set in law that BAH rates be determined on the basis of the cost of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area In both cases only civilians who were US citizens and working full time were included CBO used those approaches to assess the military housing standards and the adequacy of BAH in two different ways Comparing BAH payments with the housing costs of civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of service members indicates what kind of housing service members would probably rent if they worked in the civilian sector comparing BAH standards to the housing costs of civilians with the same income shows the housing choices civilians make when afforded the same resources as military service members How Do Military Housing Standards Compare With the Types of Housing Civilians Rent The type of housing that civilians chose to rent varied substantially from MHA to MHA That variation was partly attributable to differences in the cost of rental housing compared with other goods and services across the United States Civilians typically rented smaller housing units apartments in more expensive MHAs and larger units detached singlefamily homes in less expensive ones By contrast the type of housing set by military housing standards is the same regardless of the MHA or the cost of those units and the allowance varies by MHA to accommodate those uniform standards in different housing markets CBO assessed the size of a unit on the basis of the number of bedrooms and whether it was detached or part of a multiunit structure CBO found that civilians who were similar in age and education to military personnel tended to rent dwellings that were smaller than the military housing standards particularly in highcost MHAs Averaging across the MHAs almost onehalf of Eequivalent civilians rented units that were smaller than the standard specified by DoD for service members at that pay grade with dependentsa twobedroom townhouse or duplex In highcost areas that share was largernearly percent of civilians rented smaller apartments Only percent of E civilian equivalents rented units that matched the housing standard Civilians who had income similar to that of military personnel also sometimes rented housing that was smaller than DoDs standard For example averaging across MHAs about percent of civilians with income similar to that of an E with dependents rented units smaller than the standard In highcost MHAs nearly percent rented smaller units A small share percent rented the standard CBO found similar patterns under both approaches when comparing civilians similar to Es How Do Basic Allowance for Housing Payments Compare With the Rental Costs of Similar Civilians The average BAH payment in an MHA was typically higher than the median cost for rent and utilities paid by civilians who were similar to service members either in terms of demographic characteristics or income see Summary Figure S CBO found that BAH for Es with dependents was percent larger on average than the rental costs paid by civilians with similar age and education profiles That difference was most pronounced in MHAs with the highest BAH rates and the highest overall costs of renting including utility costs For example the New York and Boston metropolitan areas had two of the highest BAH rates and rental costsand also two of the largest gaps between BAH and what comparable civilians pay in rent and utilities BAH was much closer to civilian rental costs in some other areas Figure S Average Percentage by Which BAH for Es With Dependents Exceeded Median Rental Costs of Similar Civilians to Percent Average BAH for Es with dependents exceeded the median rental costs of similar civilians The difference was more than twice as large for civilians with similar age and education profiles as it was for civilians with similar income Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the American Community Survey and the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata Rental costs include utility costs Percentage differences between BAH and median civilian rental costs within each MHA were averaged across MHAs to derive the average percentage difference CBO did not weight each MHA by its activeduty or civilian population CBOs sample included civilians who were married had dependent children or both and who were employed full time Civilians who were similar to Es in age and education profiles were between the ages of and and had a high school diploma or some college education Civilians who were similar to Es by income were between the ages of and and had income equal to regular military compensation RMC plus or minus percent CBO calculated local RMC rates by replacing the national average BAH payment with MHAspecific BAH rates The sample included civilians who rented all types of housing that were available except for studio apartments boats RVs and tents none of which were common in most MHAs BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area BAH for an E with dependents was about percent higher on average than housing costs for civilians with similar income That percent gap was less than half the size of the gap between BAH and housing costs for civilians with similar demographic characteristics because cash compensation for enlisted personnel approximates the earnings at about the th percentile of male civilian workers with comparable years of experience and education Most civilians with income similar to that of Es tend to have different demographic characteristics than Es They are older and have more education What Are the Limitations of CBOs Analysis Although CBO used two methods to compare civilians to military personnel those civilians probably differed from service members in other ways such as ability and job characteristics that contribute to the differences in BAH and civilian housing that CBO found Civilian renters may also differ from service members in their decisionmaking process In addition comparisons of BAH and civilian housing were less precise because the national survey data that CBO used did not align perfectly with MHAs and because few respondents similar to military personnel were surveyed for some geographic areas For more details about CBOs method and the data the agency used see the appendix The Basic Allowance for Housing Since its establishment DoD has provided government owned quarters or an allowance in lieu thereof to some service members In fiscal year a collection of housing allowances for service members was consolidated into the Basic Allowance for Housing program Within that program there are several types of allowances This report considers only activecomponent personnel stationed in the United States who receive the full taxfree allowance Those personnel generally live off base or in housing on base that is operated by privatesector companies through publicprivate partnerships what DoD refers to as privatized housing The BAH that military personnel receive is intended to cover percent of the rental costs of suitable housing In about service members or about twothirds of military personnel received full BAH They received an annual housing allowance of about on average About of those service members lived in offbase housing DoDs spending on the housing allowance has increased faster than the rate of general inflation and the rate of rental housing costs in the United States over the past years That increase has been fueled by the growth both in the share of service members receiving BAH and in the average monthly payment per service member How DoD Determines BAH Rates By law BAH rates must reflect the cost of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area To accomplish that goal DoD employs a multistep process First DoD sets military housing standards that assign a number of bedrooms and type of housing to service members on the basis of pay grade and family status Second DoD divides the country into military housing areas and sets separate BAH rates for each military housing standard in each MHA Finally BAH rates are adjusted annually on the basis of surveys of local rental prices although DoD considers other factors as well Those changes occur under existing DoD policy and current law and do not require an explicit policy decision by the department or action by the Congress Military Housing Standards DoD defines housing standards using six types of dwellings that are linked to certain combinations of pay grade and dependency Those combinations are known as anchor points see Table For example the anchor point for an E with dependents is a twobedroom townhouse or duplex Table Selected Military Housing Standards and the Pay Grade Associated With Each Housing Type Notes Data source Department of Defense Defense Travel Management Office Basic Allowance for Housing BAH Primer January The Department of Defense defines housing standards for BAH associating six types of housing or anchor points with selected pay grades and dependency statuses It surveys vacant dwellings of those types in selected areas within each MHA to determine BAH rates for those statuses BAH rates for other statuses are interpolated BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area na not applicable a Officers who were enlisted service members before entering the officer ranks Military Housing Areas To reflect geographic differences in housing costs DoD creates about MHAs each of which surrounds one or more military installations MHAs are meant to represent regional housing markets where most service members might live DoD can and sometimes does reassess those boundaries DoD uses the rental prices in a given MHA for each anchor point to set BAH rates for that area to ensure that service members can afford housing that meets their military housing standard in that geographic area Military housing standards do not change depending on where a service member is stationed but the BAH they receive does BAH Rates To establish or adjust BAH rates for an MHA local DoD housing offices and contractors obtain market information on vacant rental properties That information collected in rental market surveys excludes properties in an MHA that are deemed inadequate or unsuitable on the basis of certain criteria such as the condition of the dwelling or security of the neighborhood Rental properties in some areas such as those where the typical civilian income is not comparable with service members income or those near environmental hazards may also be excluded DoD uses data from those rental market surveys to determine the median rental cost for vacant properties for each anchor point and national survey data from the American Community Survey ACS to determine the average utility costs in an MHA Together those values form the basis for the BAH rates associated with each MHA for each of the anchor points DoD uses additional data and methods to account for areas with few vacancies and to adjust for other anomalies For those pay grades that are not assigned to an anchor point DoD uses interpolation or filling in between anchor points to calculate the BAH rate For most personnel DoD interpolates a BAH rate by calculating the cost difference between the assigned anchor point and the next anchor point and adding a percentage of that difference to the assigned anchorpoint rate For example for an E with dependents DoD uses a value in terms of rental costs between a threebedroom townhouse or duplex and a threebedroom singlefamily home DoD makes additional adjustments as needed to ensure that BAH rates for each pay grade and status abide with the laws and policies governing the allowance The process of surveying rental rates in the civilian rental market begins roughly a year before the new BAH rates take effect which means that any new rates reflect market conditions from the previous year That can pose a problem for service members if rents rise rapidly within a year If BAH rates are raised in an MHA service members who move to or remain stationed in that MHA collect the new BAH payments If BAH rates are adjusted down because rents are falling service members who already are stationed in that MHA receive the same BAH rate as they did the previous year with no reduction How BAH Payments Vary by Service Member The size of the BAH payment provided to military service members who live off base or in privatized housing varies by service members pay grade and their family status Because the cost of housing also varies by location where service members are stationed also affects the amount of their housing allowance Pay Grade Military personnel in the same location and with the same family status receive higher BAH payments as their pay grade increases The exception is junior enlisted personnel pay grades E through E They are required by law to receive the same BAH In annual payments for officers who collected BAH were on average for enlisted service members those payments were Personnel at higher pay grades were more likely to be eligible for and receive BAH see Figure For instance more than percent of senior enlisted service members pay grades E to E and officers received a housing allowance in whereas only percent of junior enlisted members did More than percent of service members with the pay grade of E were eligible for and received BAH CBO focused on Es in its analysis because they were one of the largest groups of military personnel accounting for percent of personnel or service members in Es were also the largest pay grade receiving BAH accounting for percent of the total Figure Share of Enlisted Service Members Who Received BAH in by Pay Grade Percent Senior service members were more likely to receive BAH both because a larger share of them were married and because senior personnel who are single generally are not required to live in housing owned or operated by the government Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using Department of Defenses Compensation Greenbook See wwwcbogovpublicationdata BAH basic allowance for housing Dependents Most senior enlisted personnel and officers are eligible for BAH regardless of whether they are married or have children More than percent of those personnel had dependents in By contrast junior enlisted service members are typically eligible to receive BAH only if they have a dependent otherwise they are usually required to live on base in housing owned and operated by the government such as barracks In only percent of junior service members had dependents Service members at the same pay grade without dependents receive at least percent of the BAH payment received by those with dependents For example in an E without dependents stationed in Jacksonville Florida received whereas an E with dependents received Location BAH rates vary most by location Service members stationed in a highcost area as measured by the median amount paid by civilians for a twobedroom apartment receive relatively large housing allowances In for example annual BAH for an E with dependents ranged from in Johnstown Pennsylvania to in San Francisco see Figure Figure Annual BAH for Es With Dependents in by Military Housing Area Thousands of dollars Across MHAs the annual median BAH payment for Es with dependents was in That is half of all MHAs had allowances that were higher than that amount and half had allowances that were lower Es in most MHAs received roughly similar amounts although the highest annual BAH was in San Francisco and the lowest was in Johnstown Pennsylvania Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata CBO ranked all MHAs by their amount of BAH lowest to highest The three MHAs with the lowest BAH were in the first percentile the next three in the second percentile and so forth The line connects the different MHAs BAH values BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area Despite that wide variation BAH payments were generally similar for most MHAs in less than percent had BAH payment rates exceeding for Es with dependents The nationwide average across MHAs for those service members was that year The median payment across MHAs was the lower median value indicates that payments for highercost MHAs deviated from the average by more than payments for lowercost MHAs did How Costs for BAH Have Changed The growing share of service members receiving BAH coupled with increasing monthly payments per recipient has fueled growth in DoDs spending on the housing allowance that is faster than both the rate of general inflation and the rate of changes in rental costs in the United States over the past years The average monthly payment has also grown faster than other elements of RMC BAH is the secondlargest component of RMC DoDs Spending on Housing for Service Members The most recent major reform occurred in fiscal year when the existing housing allowances were consolidated into a single BAH programwhich specified methods for setting allowances that differed from the previous program and affected payments for military personnel across the country At about the same time DoD undertook a program to improve the quality of military housing available to service members by privatizing onbase military housing known as the Military Housing Privatization Initiative MHPI With the advent of the MHPI some of DoDs housing costs shifted from appropriations for family housing to those for military personnel the appropriations title from which BAH is paid The implementation of the MHPI increased spending on BAH Previously service members who lived on base in DoDmanaged housing were not responsible for monthly rental payments instead the cost for their housing was paid directly from DoDs family housing appropriations With the privatization of onbase housing DoD began providing BAH to those service members who live in that housing the amount of service members BAH is automatically deducted from their paychecks and paid to the housing provider However BAH increased significantly more than the familyhousing budget account shrank even after removing the effects of inflation see Figure Between fiscal years and BAH grew from billion to billion in dollars or by percent Over the same period funding for family housing fell by about billion or just over percent By BAH accounted for about percent of the military personnel appropriation and about percent of the total DoD budget Those shares were the same in the focus of this report Figure Budget for Military Housing by Fiscal Year Billions of dollars The amount spent on military housing has increased faster than economywide inflation in the United States over the past years because the number of BAH recipients and the cost per recipient have increased The housing allowance increased rapidly in the s largely as a result of the privatization of onbase housing which increased the number of service members receiving BAH and other policy changes that modified the way housing allowances were calculated Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata BAH basic allowance for housing DoD Department of Defense a The sum of the budgets for the housing allowance and family housing b Includes the costs associated with all types of BAH In the BAH program replaced a different program of housing allowances managed by DoD c Funds the operation maintenance leasing and construction of military family housing that is owned and operated by DoD worldwide It also funds the oversight of DoDs privatized housing on base Increasing Number of Service Members Receiving BAH The share of service members who receive BAH has grown rapidlyfrom about onehalf of active component personnel or about service members in to twothirds or about service members in That increase is directly related to the privatization of military housing complexes In few service members lived in privatized housing on base but by between and service members did by CBOs estimate The growth in the number of recipients accounts for roughly onethird of the overall growth in spending on BAH over that period Other factors although smaller in scope also contributed to more service members receiving BAH First the share of service members in more senior pay grades who qualified for BAH has grown slightly Second some services dropped the requirement that unmarried Es Es and Es live in governmentprovided housing now allowing some of those service members to live off base or in privatized onbase housing and to collect BAH Those changes resulted in more than service members receiving BAH in who would not have done so otherwise Rising Average Payments per Recipient The increase in the size of payments that service members receive accounts for roughly twothirds of the growth in total BAH spending from to Overall payments per recipient increased from about in to about in adjusted to remove the effects of economywide inflation and expressed in dollars Over that period the average annual increase in BAH per recipient was percent higher than the percent growth in the consumer price index for rent of the primary residence CPI for rent and the percent inflation rate in the economy as measured by the gross domestic product price index To illustrate the effect of the growth in BAH CBO calculated the average annual BAH payment that service members with the rank of E would have received between and if BAH payments had grown at the same rate as the prices of rental housing as measured by the CPI for rent see Figure By average payments would have been about percent smallerabout had BAH grown at the rate of the CPI for rent after Assuming that the differences between BAH growth and the CPI for rent of the primary residence for other pay grades were similar to the differences for Es BAH spending would have been roughly billion or about percent less in if it had grown at the rate experienced in rental housing generally since In other words BAH spending in excess of economywide growth in the cost of rental housing was about billion in Figure Comparison of Growth in BAH for Es and Civilian Rental Prices by Calendar Year Thousands of nominal dollars per recipient In BAH per E recipient would have been about percent lower on average if it had grown at the same rate as prices for rental housing in the general economy starting in Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the Department of Defense and the Bureau of Labor Statistics See wwwcbogovpublicationdata BAH basic allowance for housing CPI for rent consumer price index for rent of the primary residence Several changes in DoDs housing policies over the past years increased BAH payments to recipients particularly in the early s First lawmakers authorized a restructuring of housing allowances to eliminate the outofpocket expenses that service members were expected to pay for housing Before BAH payments were required to cover percent of the monthly cost of adequate housing in the area Second allowance rates were more closely linked to increases in local rental rates and finally BAH payments were protected from any declines in those rates As a result of those changes annual increases in housing allowances substantially outpaced changes in the CPI for rent between and For Es BAH grew by percent per year on average during that period whereas annual growth in rental rates in the economy averaged percent In addition amid concerns about differences in housing allowances for service members with and without dependents in the late s DoD raised housing allowances for service members without dependents to equal at least percent of allowances for service members with dependents in the same duty location with the same rank That change also increased average BAH payments Two changes offset some of the growth in BAH per recipient in the s In DoD eliminated the cost of renters insurance from the computation of BAH payments It also reversed the policy of paying for percent of local median rental costs Over a fiveyear implementation period DoD slowed the growth in BAH until in DoD set housing allowances to cover percent of those costs As a result the growth rate of BAH spending per recipient for that period was slightly slower than the growth rate of the CPI for rent The increases in BAH payments to cover a larger share of rental costs from percent to percent resulted in additional costs to DoD of roughly billion in which accounts for percent of BAH spending per recipient in excess of economywide growth in the cost of rental housing How CBO Identified Similar Civilians CBO used the Census Bureaus American Community Survey ACS data from to to determine the type and rental cost of housing that civilians similar to military personnel chose CBO did not include data for civilians who owned their houses because BAH is calculated to cover rental costs not homeownership costs However some military personnel chose to purchase homes and pay for those costs using BAH for more details see Box Box BAH and Home Ownership The Basic Allowance for Housing BAH is intended to offset the rental cost of housing however it can also be used for mortgage payments and many military personnel choose to purchase a home rather than rent one Using data from the American Community Survey ACS from to the Congressional Budget Office found that about percent of service members stationed in the United States owned their own homes When the sample was restricted to only those service members who received full BAH the share was larger at percent Several factors may contribute to whether service members receiving BAH buy or rent their housing First the military lifestylefor example regularly moving throughout ones careerprobably affects service members decisions about whether they purchase a home The costs associated with buying or selling a home when changing assignments could make owning relatively costly when compared with renting Although those service members might be able to rent their homes when they moved to a new duty station doing so also would entail costs and risks that service members might want to avoid Second service members age and marital status affect their housing decisions Military homeowners on average were six years older than the general military population over the period and were more likely to be married Just over percent of all service members were married compared with percent of service members who were homeowners Those older service members might be able to remain at a location for more than one tour or they might plan to reside at the location after leaving military service Third the decision of service members to own or rent a home could also be correlated with higher household income if for example they have a spouse with another income However spouses of military homeowners were only slightly more likely to work than those of service members who rented Data from the ACS suggest that service members who chose to purchase a home with their BAH payment often did not rely on a second income to cover ownership costs Fourth general considerations relevant to all potential homeowners also affected service members housing decisions Homeowners assume a host of responsibilities and risks in terms of time and moneysuch as upkeep and property value depreciationthat renters do not Homeownership also carries benefits however including capital appreciation of the housing The relative weight of those costs and benefits differs for each owner or renter Additionally although homeowners do not pay rent they would probably make a monthly mortgage payment BAH payments are calibrated according to median rental costs and do not necessarily reflect the costs of home ownership in an area Monthly mortgage costs are affected by the down payment and interest rate paid by the borrower Those factors are partially offset by the home loan guarantee program of the Department of Veterans Affairs VA which allows eligible service members to obtain mortgage loans with more favorable terms Also VA loans do not generally require a down payment thereby enabling more military personnel to purchase homes To identify civilians similar to service members at specific pay grades CBO used two approaches Under the first approach CBO identified civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of military personnel at each pay grade CBO considered age and education in part because both reflect a persons human capital their skills knowledge and experience and consequently influence their potential earnings Both older workers and workers with higher levels of education typically have higher earnings Additionally those demographic characteristics affect peoples lives in many ways including how they make decisions about employment and housing However DoD selects more skilled or able recruits among high school graduates as evidenced by their aboveaverage scores on national aptitude tests physical fitness exams and other entrance criteria Because age and education do not account for the standards required to enter military service the median salary of civilians with similar age and education profiles is likely to be lower than that of their military counterparts As a result the types of housing that group of civilians selects are on average probably smaller than the military standard and median rents for that group are likely to be lower than BAH Under the second approach CBO identified civilians with personal income similar to the average income that service members received at each pay grade CBO considered income for two reasons First it is an important component in determining peoples choices for housing and second DoD is required to provide housing allowances that reflect the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable levels of income in the same area Using income to compare military personnel and civilians also has limitations however First civilians with similar income tend to be older and have more education than military personnel Second enlisted service members are paid at about the th percentile of the earnings of civilians with similar demographic characteristics service members would have lower earnings if they were paid at DoDs benchmark of the th percentile In addition research has shown that when holding factors such as the standardized test scores in the Armed Forces Qualification Test fixed military personnel earn more than civilians with similar characteristics In other words median salaries of military personnel would probably have been lower had they been civilians How CBO Compared Data for Civilian Housing and Military Housing Areas Housing data summarized at a national level may obscure large differences in where service members and civilians live as well as regional variations in housing thus CBO compared civilian housing data at the MHA level However geographic units in the ACS do not align with MHAs so CBO used a weighting method to distribute the population within each geographic unit to each of the MHAs it overlaps with To determine how much similar civilians paid for rent and utilities CBO used the rental costs they reported in the ACS That is the agency used occupied rental units to compare costs of rent and utilities with BAH payments CBO did not exclude some housing units that DoD might deem unsuitable when calculating median rental prices See the appendix for more details How Civilian Housing Choices Compare With Military Housing Standards DoDs policy of fixing one housing standard for all geographic regions allows service members of the same pay grade and family status to live in similar housing no matter where they are stationed although they are free to choose other housing types That practice permits service members to rent similar housing if they move to a different posting However the policy does not account for the fact that people tend to rent different types of housing in different geographic regions depending in part on the relative prices of goods and services there When housing costs are relatively expensive people tend to reduce the quantity of housing they consume and increase their purchases of other goods and services To gauge whether DoDs fixed housing standards broadly reflect the housing choices of comparable civilians CBO examined the types of housing that civilians rent in high middle and lowcost housing areas Military installations where large numbers of activeduty personnel are stationed are represented in each of the cost areas although most MHAs with large numbers of activeduty personnel are not in the highestcost areas For example Fort Bliss and Fort Cavazos formerly Fort Hood have large populations of activeduty service members and are located in lowcost areas in Texas San Diego California and the Washington DC metropolitan area are two of the exceptions They both have many military installations with some of the largest populations of military personnel and are in highcost areas CBO found substantial differences between military housing standards and civilians housing choices regardless of the overall cost of housing for the area Housing Choices Made by Civilians With Age and Education Profiles Similar to Those of Military Personnel BAH rates for Es with dependents are based on the cost of renting a twobedroom townhouse or duplex CBO found that on average only about percent of civilians who were comparable to Es with dependents in terms of age and education rented such homes Instead their housing choices varied considerably see Figure top panel Figure Housing Rented by Civilians Similar to Es With Dependents to Percent Although the housing standard was the same across MHAs the types of housing that civilians similar to Es rented varied widely Civilians in highcost areas typically chose smaller housing units than the standard and civilians in lowercost housing areas rented larger units than civilians in highercost areas did Only a small fraction of civilians rented housing that matched the military housing standard Civilians with income equivalent to Es with dependents rented larger housing units than civilians who were demographically similar to Es did because the cash compensation of Es was higher than the median income of civilians with similar demographic characteristics Cash compensation of Es was also higher than DoDs benchmark Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the American Community Survey See wwwcbogovpublicationdata To identify lowcost and highcost MHAs CBO calculated the cost of housing in an MHA on the basis of the rental costs including utilities paid by people between the ages of and for a twobedroom apartment The agency then ranked MHAs by median rent and considered those MHAs in the lowest quartile of median rent as lowcost housing areas and those in the highest quartile as highcost areas The distribution of housing rented by civilians was calculated within each MHA and then averaged across high and lowcost MHAs to derive the reported distributions CBO did not weight each MHA by its activeduty or civilian population CBOs sample included civilians who were married had dependent children or both and who were employed full time Civilians who were similar to Es in age and education were between the ages of and and had a high school diploma or some college education Civilians who were similar to Es by income were between the ages of and and had income equal to regular military compensation RMC plus or minus percent CBO calculated local RMC rates by replacing the national average BAH payment with MHAspecific BAH rates The sample included civilians who rented all types of housing that were available except for studio apartments boats RVs and tents none of which were common in most MHAs BAH basic allowance for housing DoD Department of Defense MHA military housing area a Includes most types of housing other than DoDs housing standards such as three and fourbedroom apartments mobile homes and twobedroom singlefamily homes Most housing in that category was larger than the housing standard for Es with dependents Because military housing standards remain the same across MHAs the patterns in civilian housing choices suggest that service members in highcost areas were generally able to rent housing that was larger than that of their civilian counterparts whether they had similar age and education profiles or similar income Averaged over the MHAs nearly half of Eequivalent civilians rented smaller units defined as one or twobedroom apartments than the military housing standard Typically civilians rented relatively smaller housing units in more expensive MHAs than they did in less expensive ones Nearly percent of civilians comparable to Es with dependents in highcost areas rented units that were smaller than a twobedroom townhouse or duplex compared with about percent of those in lowcost MHAs In highcost areas about percent of civilians rented larger homes defined as threebedroom townhomes or three or fourbedroom singlefamily homes than the military housing standard in lowcost areas more than percent of civilians did so The difference between high and lowcost areas was even greater when considering all housing larger than the DoD housing standards That category also included three and fourbedroom apartments and townhomes and twobedroom single family homes which make up a large share of the other category Differences in housing choices in highcost and lowcost areas were also evident for civilians who were comparable with service members of other military ranks However a smaller share of older civilians or civilians equivalent to service members of higher military ranks rented one or twobedroom apartments than did younger civilians That held true in high and lowcost areas Housing Choices Made by Civilians With Income Similar to That of Military Personnel DoD requires that military housing standards reflect the housing types normally occupied by civilians of comparable income However as was the case for civilians with similar age and education profiles few civilians with comparable incomealso percentrented housing that corresponded to the military housing standard for Es with dependents Although about percent of civilians with income equivalent to Es rented housing smaller than the standard they were more likely than civilians with comparable age and education profiles to rent larger units than the military housing standard see Figure bottom panel Factors Influencing Civilians Housing Choices With both types of comparisons CBO found that the types of housing rented by civilians similar to Es with dependents varied widely and that the percentage of civilians who rented homes at the military housing standard was relatively small It is not surprising to find such a wide variety of housing occupied by renters Two factors may help explain those findings individual preferences and total household income First people have different priorities when choosing housingsome are willing to pay more of their income than other people for some attributes such as high quality local schools or a larger property Other people in order to afford larger homes may be willing to sacrifice in other ways For instance some of the rentals that CBO classified as larger could be older less wellmaintained or in less popular neighborhoods Although the type of housing people chose to rent varied in some cases the cost of that housing could be similar to the BAH rates assigned to the relevant military housing standard CBO could not determine from ACS data the desirability of the different types of housing that civilians chose Second some households included in the ACS had dual incomes and some had single incomes DoD sets its BAH rates on a service members income but housing decisions are based in part on household income which may include more than one income As household income increases housing expenditures generally also increase Civilians who were part of dualincome families might have rented larger homes than military housing standards because their household income exceeded that of similar service members To examine the effect dual incomes had on civilians housing choices CBO analyzed the distribution of housing by single and dualincome families separately The agency found that percent of Eequivalent civilians with working spouses rented singlefamily homes with three or four bedrooms whereas about percent of those households with only one income did so Either comparison might be considered appropriate so CBO included both single and dualincome households in its primary analysis On the one hand DoD service members are less likely to have spouses who work in the paid labor force and those who do earn less than comparable civilians Consequently total income in service members households might not be as high as that in comparable civilians households If the military lifestyle makes working less feasible for spouses some might argue that housing allowances should compare to what dualincome families pay in rent On the other hand service members earn more than most civilians of similar age and with similar education in which case military housing standards and BAH payments may partially or wholly offset the effect of dual incomes on civilians housing choices How Median Civilian Rents Compare With BAH BAH rates vary by location so CBO also examined whether those rates matched the median rents that comparable civilians paid To do so the agency determined the median rental costs for comparable civilians in each MHA and then calculated the percentage difference between that and BAH CBO found that within individual MHAs the amount of BAH that DoD paid to service members was usually larger than the median rental rates for comparable civiliansunder both methods CBO used to define civilian equivalents That percentage difference was on average largest in those locations with the highest BAH rates and those with the highest average rental costs For an example of how housing choices and rental rates varied by pay grade within a specific MHA Norfolk Virginia see Box Box Case Study Norfolk Virginia The types of housing civilians choose to rent and the associated costs can vary considerably by military housing area MHA That variation is based in part on the local markets supply of rental housing the relative prices of goods and peoples preferences The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the housing choices of civilians in Norfolk Virginia to compare civilian housing choices with military housing standards and the associated basic allowance for housing BAH rates for service members at multiple pay grades CBO chose Norfolk Virginia in part because it is home to one of the Navys largest bases The MHA surrounding Norfolk has a relatively large activeduty population of roughly and a civilian population of over million In addition its overall cost of housing was in the middle of the national distribution in CBO examined the housing choices made by three groups civilians similar to Es with dependents civilians similar to Es without dependents and civilians similar to Es with dependents Housing Rented by Civilians Similar to Service Members at Various Pay Grades in Norfolk Virginia to Percent Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the American Community Survey and Department of Defense See

compensation RMC plus or minus percent CBO calculated local RMC rates by replacing the national average BAH payment with MHAspecific BAH rates The sample included civilians who rented all types of housing that were available except for studio apartments boats RVs and tents none of which were common in most MHAs BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area a Includes most types of housing other than DoDs housing standards such as three and fourbedroom apartments mobile homes and twobedroom singlefamily houses Most housing in that category was larger than the housing standard for Es with dependents Types of Housing Chosen by Civilians At least percent of civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of Es rented housing that was smaller one or twobedroom apartments than the military housing standard of a twobedroom townhouse and more than percent rented housing larger than the Department of Defenses DoDs standard see first table The difference persisted but was smaller for Eequivalent civilians at least percent of comparable civilians rented housing that was smaller than the standard for that pay grade a threebedroom townhouse or duplex Relatively few Es or Es rented housing similar to their respective standard only percent of Es and percent of Es The share of E and Eequivalent civilians residing in housing larger than the DoD standards increased substantially when CBO compared civilians with military personnel based on income That share increased further when considering all housing larger than the DoD housing standards contained in the other category Those patterns are similar to those at the national level In the broader analysis CBO did not focus on Es because there were very few similar civilians for comparison most civilians comparable to Es had roommates But for completeness the agency did analyze that group for Norfolk Most Es without dependents in the military are between the ages of and BAH rates allow those service members to rent their housing standarda onebedroom apartmentwithout requiring a roommate however most civilians comparable to Es seek out roommates In Norfolk nearly percent of civilians comparable to Es in terms of age and education reported living with a roommate or family member In this analysis CBO restricted the civilian sample to renters who did not report living with roommates or family members to better compare civilian housing outcomes with the military standard However civilians without roommates probably earned more than civilians with roommates and therefore CBOs sample presumably included a relatively large share of people who chose larger housing Monthly BAH for Service Members at Various Pay Grades and Median Rental Costs for Similar Civilians in Norfolk

to the national pattern the determination of median civilian rents in Norfolk depended on how CBO defined a comparable civilian BAH rates in Norfolk were higher than civilian rents for the demographic and income comparisons for all categories with the exception of civilians with income similar to that of Es with dependents see second table The percentage differences between BAH and civilian rent were smaller when income not age and education was used as the metric Rental Costs for Civilians With Age and Education Profiles Similar to Those of Military Personnel CBO found that BAH rates were higher than the median rent of civilians with similar age and education profiles in almost all MHAs That relationship suggests that DoD may be offering larger housing allowances on average than necessary to meet retention goals Averaged over all MHAs in CBOs sample of civilians with similar demographic characteristics the monthly BAH payment for Es in was whereas the median rental cost for civilians was a difference of percent MHAs with the highest BAH rates had on average larger differences between BAH and what civilians paid for rent and utilities than MHAs with the lowest BAH rates see Figure left panel In the quarter of MHAs with the highest BAH payments BAH rates for Es were percent higher than their civilian median rental costs By contrast in the quarter of MHAs with the lowest BAH payments BAH rates for Es were about percent higher than the median civilian rental costs in those locations Those results include both single and dualincome civilian households Figure Percentage by Which BAH for Es With Dependents Exceeded Median Rental Costs of Similar Civilians to Percent Average BAH for Es with dependents was percent larger than the median rent of civilians with similar age and education profiles and percent larger than that of civilians with similar income For both categories of similar civilians the percentage difference between BAH and civilian rental costs was greatest in MHAs with the highest BAH and smallest in MHAs with the lowest BAH Across all quartiles the gap was substantially higher for civilians with similar age and education profiles than for civilians with similar income Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the American Community Survey and the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata Rental costs include utility costs Percentage differences between BAH and median civilian rent within each MHA were averaged across MHAs to derive the average percentage differences CBO did not report findings for MHAs with fewer than observations in the American Community Survey resulting in a sample with MHAs for civilians with similar age and education levels and MHAs for those with similar income CBO constructed the quartiles which divide the number of MHAs into four equal groups on the basis of those smaller samples CBOs sample included civilians who were married had dependent children or both and who were employed full time Civilians who were similar to Es in age and education were between the ages of and and had a high school diploma or some college education Civilians who were

that gap across MHAs with similar BAH rates see Figure In only a few cases was BAH lower than the median rental cost for civilians with comparable age and education and only in the lower percentiles Figure Variation in the Percentage by Which BAH Exceeded Median Rent Paid by Civilians Similar to Es With Dependents to Percent The difference in BAH and the median rent paid by civilians varied substantially across MHAs under both approaches BAH was lower than the median rent paid by civilians with similar age and education profiles in only a few MHAs BAH was closer to the median rent paid by civilians with similar income but was still lower in only a small number of MHAs Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the American Community Survey and the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata Costs of rental housing include utility costs Each dot in the figure represents an estimate for one MHA Some MHAs had fewer than observations the figure does not include dots for those MHAs However MHA percentiles were constructed using all MHAs regardless of the number of observations CBOs sample included civilians who were married had dependent children or

BAH payment with MHAspecific BAH rates The sample included civilians who rented all types of housing that were available except for studio apartments boats RVs and tents none of which were common in most MHAs BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area CBO also estimated the median civilian rental costs for single and dualincome households separately Because of frequent moves and the deployments of service members it may be more difficult for military spouses to work In that case DoD may make up for lower spousal income with a housing allowance that allows service members to afford the same housing as dualincome families CBO found that civilians living in dualincome households spent about more per month on housing than those living in singleincome households reducing the percentage gap between BAH for Es with dependents and median civilian rental costs over all MHAs in the sample from percent to percent on average Rental Costs for Civilians With Income Similar to That of Military Personnel CBO found that a gap between civilian rental costs and BAH payments persisted but was smaller for civilians with income similar to that of Es with dependents because median rent including utilities was higher for those civilians than it was for civilians with age and education profiles similar to those service members Averaged over all MHAs in CBOs sample of civilians with similar income the monthly BAH payment for Es in was compared with the median monthly rental cost of for civilians with similar income a difference of percent The difference tended to be larger on average in areas with the highest BAH rates and smaller in areas with the lowest BAH rates see Figure right panel In the quarter of MHAs with the largest housing allowances BAH rates for Es were percent higher than the median rental costs paid by civilians with similar income Among the quarter of MHAs with the lowest housing allowances BAH rates were percent higher than the median rental costs for civilians Though variation in the percentage difference was large across locations regardless of the BAH rates that variation was smaller for civilians with comparable income than for civilians with comparable age and education profiles see Figure In addition rental costs exceeded BAH in fewer than percent of MHAs Under the income approach the number of observations was too small to calculate the difference in median rental costs by singleincome households and dualincome households in the civilian sector However if the same difference per month applied to the income approach as under the demographic approach the percentage gap between BAH and median rental costs would drop from roughly percent to percent How BAH and Median Civilian Rental Costs Differ by MHAs Characteristics CBO also examined whether some attributes of the MHAs were associated with the percentage differences between BAH payments and median rents including utilities To do so CBO considered the correlation between the percentage difference in BAH and civilian rental costs using three measures the overall cost of housing in an MHA the number of service members living in the MHA and the total population of the MHA CBO found that in MHAs where rental costs were most expensive the percentage difference between BAH for Es with dependents and the median rental costs of civilians of similar age and education paid was also disproportionately large About percent of the highestcost MHAs were in the top quarter of differences between BAH and civilian rental costs for those who were similar to Es in age and education levels For example Washington DC was in the largest difference group but the Honolulu Hawaii MHA had relatively small percentage differences between BAH and median civilian housing costs About percent of the areas with the lowest overall costs of housing were in locations with the smallest percentage differences The same relationships held true for civilians with income similar to that of Es BAH rates may differ substantially from median civilian rental costs in highcost areas for a variety of reasons Highcost MHAs often span large metropolitan areas and a greater share of rental units may be excluded from DoDs price calculations in those urban settings if a large share of rental housing is of low quality or in areas with crime rates above the national average Moreover DoDs rental surveys primarily include rental units that are on the market at the time the survey was conducted Data show that the annual growth in rental costs for recent movers is higher than that for longterm tenants The difference in rental prices for new tenants and other renters may be larger in more expensive locations Under both definitions of similar civilians CBO found that BAH rates in MHAs associated with large military installations and correspondingly large numbers of service members stationed there were more closely aligned with median civilian rental costs than those in MHAs with few service members That correlation mitigates some of the additional costs DoD would have incurred had all large installations been located in highcost MHAs CBO also found that the larger the share of service members of total population in an MHA the more similar BAH rates were to civilians cost of housing It is unclear whether DoD does a better job matching housing market prices in those areas or if BAH has an outsized effect on market rates in those areas It is possible that BAH rates might cause local rental rates to rise particularly if the number of service members as a share of the local population was relatively large However evidence of the correlation is limited Factors Affecting BAH Rates and Estimates of Median Civilian Rental Costs Estimates of civilian rental costs and consequently BAH rates are sensitive to the way those costs are calculated Several factors affect the calculation of median rental costs how comparable civilians are defined how rental housing is identified what criteria are used to exclude housing units how geographic areas used for comparison are defined and how limitations inherent in surveys are handled First how similar civilians are defined can provide higher or lower estimates of their median rent Second in determining the BAH rate for an MHA DoD surveys the cost of vacant rentals on the market which may not be the same as the cost for occupied rentals Research by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that people who move have a larger increase in annual rental costs than those who do not DoDs method may better align BAH to the rental costs faced by service members who move to a new duty station By contrast CBO calculated the cost of rental housing using the median rental costs for occupied housing those costs may be lower than the costs paid by people who move The agency did not adjust for that difference however because civilians who are the same age as Es move at roughly the same frequency that service members do about onethird in a given year suggesting that rates based on vacant rentals may overstate rental costs for those who have been in their units for a year or more Third DoDs criteria for the inclusion or exclusion of a housing unit in its surveys probably affects BAH rates Eliminating lowercost housing choices available to civilians either by excluding less desirable neighborhoods or smaller types of housing results in higher estimates of median rental costs and consequently higher BAH rates than would have occurred without the restrictions However not all inclusions or exclusions appear to change the median rents substantially For instance the inclusion or exclusion of studio apartments and mobile homes made very little difference in CBOs findingsthe median civilian rental costs changed by less than percent Fourth the estimation of civilians rental costs is sensitive to the boundaries of an MHA Not surprisingly expanding or constricting the area can lead to variation in the median rents calculated and subsequent BAH payments For instance eight geographic areas in the ACS feed into the Norfolk Virginia MHA either wholly or partially The difference in civilian rental costs between the highest and lowestcost areas was roughly percent Finally small sample sizes and data anomalies associated with surveys can affect the calculation of median rental costs For a particular housing standard DoD often cannot find enough vacant units to meet its sampling goal generally to units In about percent of MHAs DoD could not survey enough rental units at the E housing standard to meet its minimum sample target in To mitigate that problem DoD uses additional methods to calculate BAH rates such as data from previous years and allows the substitution of housing types at some anchor points Those substitutions tend to increase the rental costs that DoD calculates and the BAH that it pays,How the Militarys Basic Allowance for Housing Compares With Civilian Housing Costs Congressional Budget Office CBO focused its analysis on civilians who were similar to enlisted military personnel with dependents at pay grade E from to Service members at that pay grade are typically between the ages of and and hold the rank of sergeant in the Army Marine Corps and Space Force staff sergeant in the Air Force or petty officer second class in the Navy They constitute one of the largest groups of BAH recipients In this report the Congressional Budget Office compares the kinds of housing that DoD defines as suitable for military personnel who receive BAH known as military housing standards with the housing choices made by two groups of civilians those with age and education profiles comparable to military personnel of each pay grade and those with comparable income CBO also compares the size of BAH payments which are derived from the military housing standards with the rental costs including utilities that comparable civilians pay The US military has provided room and board or allowances in lieu thereof to its personnel and their dependents for many decades Currently most service members on active duty are provided with housing through the basic allowance for housing BAH which is part of their cash compensation In fiscal year funding for all types of BAH was about billion in dollars percent of funding for the Department of Defenses DoDs military personnel accounts Retaining activeduty personnel depends in part on whether their compensation packagewhich includes the housing allowanceis sufficient to entice them to stay in the military All dollar values are expressed in dollars unless otherwise specified the most recent year of the American Community Survey ACS data that the Congressional Budget Office analyzed To remove the effects of inflation in housing costs reported in the ACS CBO adjusted housing rental prices using the consumer price index for rent of primary residence as described at httptinyurlcom umubw All other costs were adjusted using the gross domestic product price index as described in The Budget and Economic Outlook to February and published in full on CBOs website at wwwcbogovdatabudgeteconomicdata Unless this report indicates otherwise all years referred to are calendar years Occasionally the report refers to federal fiscal years which run from October to September and are designated by the calendar year in which they end How the Militarys Basic Allowance for Housing Compares With Civilian Housing Costs Summary About twothirds of military service members collect a taxfree housing allowance called the basic allowance for housing BAH that can be used to rent or purchase homes in the local community or to rent privately managed housing on military bases By law BAH rates must reflect the cost of adequate housing for civilians with similar income housing allowances are intended to cover percent of the combined rent and utility costs of suitable housing for service members regardless of the earnings of other household members Service members who live off base may choose to pay more than their BAH for housing or they may pay less and keep the extra pay Underpinning BAH rates are military housing standards which reflect what the Department of Defense DoD determines is suitable housingincluding the type of dwelling and number of bedroomsfor BAH recipients The housing standards are intended to generally reflect community living standards and are established on the basis of service members pay grades which reflect their rank and their family status whether or not they have a spouse or dependent children DoD annually surveys the rental costs of vacant housing that meets the standard for certain pay grades and family statuses in each geographic location around military facilities known as a military housing area or MHA and uses those costs as the basis for BAH rates for all recipients Between fiscal years and BAH funding more than doubled after removing the effects of inflation in rental housing prices In fiscal year funding for all types of BAH was about billion in dollars accounting for percent of funding for DoDs military personnel accounts Such increases in the cost of personnel may reduce the militarys ability to invest in other priorities such as training or weapons procurement But if housing allowances are not adequate service members wellbeing may be diminished and DoDs efforts to recruit and retain highquality personnel may be adversely affected In this report the Congressional Budget Office addresses two main questions How do the housing standards used to determine the monthly rates of BAH compare with the housing rented by similar civilians How do BAH rates compare with the rental costs that is rent and utility costs paid by similar civilians To answer those questions CBO looked at BAH payments and civilian housing choices for the period CBO analyzed the years immediately before the coronavirus pandemic because the pandemic affected the rental housing and labor markets in atypical ways as well as the Census Bureaus data collection efforts and the resulting data quality The agencys results suggest that on average BAH provided to military personnel was higher in some cases substantially higher than the rental costs that similar civilians pay However the difference between BAH and civilian rental costs varied considerably by location How Did CBO Define Similar Civilians CBO focused on civilians similar to enlisted service members on active duty with a pay grade of E who have dependents Es are one of the largest groups of service members who receive BAH payments They are typically between the ages of and are generally in their second or third enlistment period and hold the rank of sergeant in the Army Marine Corps and Space Force a staff sergeant in the Army or a petty officer second class in the Navy The agency defined similar civilians in two ways In the first CBO used demographic characteristics It identified civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of military personnel at various pay grades because those characteristics influence the choices people make across a spectrum of decisions and economic outcomes In the second CBO identified civilians with income similar to the cash compensation for service members by pay grade as measured by regular military compensation RMC Defining similar civilians in that way accords with the requirement set in law that BAH rates be determined on the basis of the cost of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area In both cases only civilians who were US citizens and working full time were included CBO used those approaches to assess the military housing standards and the adequacy of BAH in two different ways Comparing BAH payments with the housing costs of civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of service members indicates what kind of housing service members would probably rent if they worked in the civilian sector comparing BAH standards to the housing costs of civilians with the same income shows the housing choices civilians make when afforded the same resources as military service members How Do Military Housing Standards Compare With the Types of Housing Civilians Rent The type of housing that civilians chose to rent varied substantially from MHA to MHA That variation was partly attributable to differences in the cost of rental housing compared with other goods and services across the United States Civilians typically rented smaller housing units apartments in more expensive MHAs and larger units detached singlefamily homes in less expensive ones By contrast the type of housing set by military housing standards is the same regardless of the MHA or the cost of those units and the allowance varies by MHA to accommodate those uniform standards in different housing markets CBO assessed the size of a unit on the basis of the number of bedrooms and whether it was detached or part of a multiunit structure CBO found that civilians who were similar in age and education to military personnel tended to rent dwellings that were smaller than the military housing standards particularly in highcost MHAs Averaging across the MHAs almost onehalf of Eequivalent civilians rented units that were smaller than the standard specified by DoD for service members at that pay grade with dependentsa twobedroom townhouse or duplex In highcost areas that share was largernearly percent of civilians rented smaller apartments Only percent of E civilian equivalents rented units that matched the housing standard Civilians who had income similar to that of military personnel also sometimes rented housing that was smaller than DoDs standard For example averaging across MHAs about percent of civilians with income similar to that of an E with dependents rented units smaller than the standard In highcost MHAs nearly percent rented smaller units A small share percent rented the standard CBO found similar patterns under both approaches when comparing civilians similar to Es How Do Basic Allowance for Housing Payments Compare With the Rental Costs of Similar Civilians The average BAH payment in an MHA was typically higher than the median cost for rent and utilities paid by civilians who were similar to service members either in terms of demographic characteristics or income see Summary Figure S CBO found that BAH for Es with dependents was percent larger on average than the rental costs paid by civilians with similar age and education profiles That difference was most pronounced in MHAs with the highest BAH rates and the highest overall costs of renting including utility costs For example the New York and Boston metropolitan areas had two of the highest BAH rates and rental costsand also two of the largest gaps between BAH and what comparable civilians pay in rent and utilities BAH was much closer to civilian rental costs in some other areas Figure S Average Percentage by Which BAH for Es With Dependents Exceeded Median Rental Costs of Similar Civilians to Percent Average BAH for Es with dependents exceeded the median rental costs of similar civilians The difference was more than twice as large for civilians with similar age and education profiles as it was for civilians with similar income Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the American Community Survey and the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata Rental costs include utility costs Percentage differences between BAH and median civilian rental costs within each MHA were averaged across MHAs to derive the average percentage difference CBO did not weight each MHA by its activeduty or civilian population CBOs sample included civilians who were married had dependent children or both and who were employed full time Civilians who were similar to Es in age and education profiles were between the ages of and and had a high school diploma or some college education Civilians who were similar to Es by income were between the ages of and and had income equal to regular military compensation RMC plus or minus percent CBO calculated local RMC rates by replacing the national average BAH payment with MHAspecific BAH rates The sample included civilians who rented all types of housing that were available except for studio apartments boats RVs and tents none of which were common in most MHAs BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area BAH for an E with dependents was about percent higher on average than housing costs for civilians with similar income That percent gap was less than half the size of the gap between BAH and housing costs for civilians with similar demographic characteristics because cash compensation for enlisted personnel approximates the earnings at about the th percentile of male civilian workers with comparable years of experience and education Most civilians with income similar to that of Es tend to have different demographic characteristics than Es They are older and have more education What Are the Limitations of CBOs Analysis Although CBO used two methods to compare civilians to military personnel those civilians probably differed from service members in other ways such as ability and job characteristics that contribute to the differences in BAH and civilian housing that CBO found Civilian renters may also differ from service members in their decisionmaking process In addition comparisons of BAH and civilian housing were less precise because the national survey data that CBO used did not align perfectly with MHAs and because few respondents similar to military personnel were surveyed for some geographic areas For more details about CBOs method and the data the agency used see the appendix The Basic Allowance for Housing Since its establishment DoD has provided government owned quarters or an allowance in lieu thereof to some service members In fiscal year a collection of housing allowances for service members was consolidated into the Basic Allowance for Housing program Within that program there are several types of allowances This report considers only activecomponent personnel stationed in the United States who receive the full taxfree allowance Those personnel generally live off base or in housing on base that is operated by privatesector companies through publicprivate partnerships what DoD refers to as privatized housing The BAH that military personnel receive is intended to cover percent of the rental costs of suitable housing In about service members or about twothirds of military personnel received full BAH They received an annual housing allowance of about on average About of those service members lived in offbase housing DoDs spending on the housing allowance has increased faster than the rate of general inflation and the rate of rental housing costs in the United States over the past years That increase has been fueled by the growth both in the share of service members receiving BAH and in the average monthly payment per service member How DoD Determines BAH Rates By law BAH rates must reflect the cost of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area To accomplish that goal DoD employs a multistep process First DoD sets military housing standards that assign a number of bedrooms and type of housing to service members on the basis of pay grade and family status Second DoD divides the country into military housing areas and sets separate BAH rates for each military housing standard in each MHA Finally BAH rates are adjusted annually on the basis of surveys of local rental prices although DoD considers other factors as well Those changes occur under existing DoD policy and current law and do not require an explicit policy decision by the department or action by the Congress Military Housing Standards DoD defines housing standards using six types of dwellings that are linked to certain combinations of pay grade and dependency Those combinations are known as anchor points see Table For example the anchor point for an E with dependents is a twobedroom townhouse or duplex Table Selected Military Housing Standards and the Pay Grade Associated With Each Housing Type Notes Data source Department of Defense Defense Travel Management Office Basic Allowance for Housing BAH Primer January The Department of Defense defines housing standards for BAH associating six types of housing or anchor points with selected pay grades and dependency statuses It surveys vacant dwellings of those types in selected areas within each MHA to determine BAH rates for those statuses BAH rates for other statuses are interpolated BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area na not applicable a Officers who were enlisted service members before entering the officer ranks Military Housing Areas To reflect geographic differences in housing costs DoD creates about MHAs each of which surrounds one or more military installations MHAs are meant to represent regional housing markets where most service members might live DoD can and sometimes does reassess those boundaries DoD uses the rental prices in a given MHA for each anchor point to set BAH rates for that area to ensure that service members can afford housing that meets their military housing standard in that geographic area Military housing standards do not change depending on where a service member is stationed but the BAH they receive does BAH Rates To establish or adjust BAH rates for an MHA local DoD housing offices and contractors obtain market information on vacant rental properties That information collected in rental market surveys excludes properties in an MHA that are deemed inadequate or unsuitable on the basis of certain criteria such as the condition of the dwelling or security of the neighborhood Rental properties in some areas such as those where the typical civilian income is not comparable with service members income or those near environmental hazards may also be excluded DoD uses data from those rental market surveys to determine the median rental cost for vacant properties for each anchor point and national survey data from the American Community Survey ACS to determine the average utility costs in an MHA Together those values form the basis for the BAH rates associated with each MHA for each of the anchor points DoD uses additional data and methods to account for areas with few vacancies and to adjust for other anomalies For those pay grades that are not assigned to an anchor point DoD uses interpolation or filling in between anchor points to calculate the BAH rate For most personnel DoD interpolates a BAH rate by calculating the cost difference between the assigned anchor point and the next anchor point and adding a percentage of that difference to the assigned anchorpoint rate For example for an E with dependents DoD uses a value in terms of rental costs between a threebedroom townhouse or duplex and a threebedroom singlefamily home DoD makes additional adjustments as needed to ensure that BAH rates for each pay grade and status abide with the laws and policies governing the allowance The process of surveying rental rates in the civilian rental market begins roughly a year before the new BAH rates take effect which means that any new rates reflect market conditions from the previous year That can pose a problem for service members if rents rise rapidly within a year If BAH rates are raised in an MHA service members who move to or remain stationed in that MHA collect the new BAH payments If BAH rates are adjusted down because rents are falling service members who already are stationed in that MHA receive the same BAH rate as they did the previous year with no reduction How BAH Payments Vary by Service Member The size of the BAH payment provided to military service members who live off base or in privatized housing varies by service members pay grade and their family status Because the cost of housing also varies by location where service members are stationed also affects the amount of their housing allowance Pay Grade Military personnel in the same location and with the same family status receive higher BAH payments as their pay grade increases The exception is junior enlisted personnel pay grades E through E They are required by law to receive the same BAH In annual payments for officers who collected BAH were on average for enlisted service members those payments were Personnel at higher pay grades were more likely to be eligible for and receive BAH see Figure For instance more than percent of senior enlisted service members pay grades E to E and officers received a housing allowance in whereas only percent of junior enlisted members did More than percent of service members with the pay grade of E were eligible for and received BAH CBO focused on Es in its analysis because they were one of the largest groups of military personnel accounting for percent of personnel or service members in Es were also the largest pay grade receiving BAH accounting for percent of the total Figure Share of Enlisted Service Members Who Received BAH in by Pay Grade Percent Senior service members were more likely to receive BAH both because a larger share of them were married and because senior personnel who are single generally are not required to live in housing owned or operated by the government Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using Department of Defenses Compensation Greenbook See wwwcbogovpublicationdata BAH basic allowance for housing Dependents Most senior enlisted personnel and officers are eligible for BAH regardless of whether they are married or have children More than percent of those personnel had dependents in By contrast junior enlisted service members are typically eligible to receive BAH only if they have a dependent otherwise they are usually required to live on base in housing owned and operated by the government such as barracks In only percent of junior service members had dependents Service members at the same pay grade without dependents receive at least percent of the BAH payment received by those with dependents For example in an E without dependents stationed in Jacksonville Florida received whereas an E with dependents received Location BAH rates vary most by location Service members stationed in a highcost area as measured by the median amount paid by civilians for a twobedroom apartment receive relatively large housing allowances In for example annual BAH for an E with dependents ranged from in Johnstown Pennsylvania to in San Francisco see Figure Figure Annual BAH for Es With Dependents in by Military Housing Area Thousands of dollars Across MHAs the annual median BAH payment for Es with dependents was in That is half of all MHAs had allowances that were higher than that amount and half had allowances that were lower Es in most MHAs received roughly similar amounts although the highest annual BAH was in San Francisco and the lowest was in Johnstown Pennsylvania Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata CBO ranked all MHAs by their amount of BAH lowest to highest The three MHAs with the lowest BAH were in the first percentile the next three in the second percentile and so forth The line connects the different MHAs BAH values BAH basic allowance for housing MHA military housing area Despite that wide variation BAH payments were generally similar for most MHAs in less than percent had BAH payment rates exceeding for Es with dependents The nationwide average across MHAs for those service members was that year The median payment across MHAs was the lower median value indicates that payments for highercost MHAs deviated from the average by more than payments for lowercost MHAs did How Costs for BAH Have Changed The growing share of service members receiving BAH coupled with increasing monthly payments per recipient has fueled growth in DoDs spending on the housing allowance that is faster than both the rate of general inflation and the rate of changes in rental costs in the United States over the past years The average monthly payment has also grown faster than other elements of RMC BAH is the secondlargest component of RMC DoDs Spending on Housing for Service Members The most recent major reform occurred in fiscal year when the existing housing allowances were consolidated into a single BAH programwhich specified methods for setting allowances that differed from the previous program and affected payments for military personnel across the country At about the same time DoD undertook a program to improve the quality of military housing available to service members by privatizing onbase military housing known as the Military Housing Privatization Initiative MHPI With the advent of the MHPI some of DoDs housing costs shifted from appropriations for family housing to those for military personnel the appropriations title from which BAH is paid The implementation of the MHPI increased spending on BAH Previously service members who lived on base in DoDmanaged housing were not responsible for monthly rental payments instead the cost for their housing was paid directly from DoDs family housing appropriations With the privatization of onbase housing DoD began providing BAH to those service members who live in that housing the amount of service members BAH is automatically deducted from their paychecks and paid to the housing provider However BAH increased significantly more than the familyhousing budget account shrank even after removing the effects of inflation see Figure Between fiscal years and BAH grew from billion to billion in dollars or by percent Over the same period funding for family housing fell by about billion or just over percent By BAH accounted for about percent of the military personnel appropriation and about percent of the total DoD budget Those shares were the same in the focus of this report Figure Budget for Military Housing by Fiscal Year Billions of dollars The amount spent on military housing has increased faster than economywide inflation in the United States over the past years because the number of BAH recipients and the cost per recipient have increased The housing allowance increased rapidly in the s largely as a result of the privatization of onbase housing which increased the number of service members receiving BAH and other policy changes that modified the way housing allowances were calculated Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the Department of Defense See wwwcbogovpublicationdata BAH basic allowance for housing DoD Department of Defense a The sum of the budgets for the housing allowance and family housing b Includes the costs associated with all types of BAH In the BAH program replaced a different program of housing allowances managed by DoD c Funds the operation maintenance leasing and construction of military family housing that is owned and operated by DoD worldwide It also funds the oversight of DoDs privatized housing on base Increasing Number of Service Members Receiving BAH The share of service members who receive BAH has grown rapidlyfrom about onehalf of active component personnel or about service members in to twothirds or about service members in That increase is directly related to the privatization of military housing complexes In few service members lived in privatized housing on base but by between and service members did by CBOs estimate The growth in the number of recipients accounts for roughly onethird of the overall growth in spending on BAH over that period Other factors although smaller in scope also contributed to more service members receiving BAH First the share of service members in more senior pay grades who qualified for BAH has grown slightly Second some services dropped the requirement that unmarried Es Es and Es live in governmentprovided housing now allowing some of those service members to live off base or in privatized onbase housing and to collect BAH Those changes resulted in more than service members receiving BAH in who would not have done so otherwise Rising Average Payments per Recipient The increase in the size of payments that service members receive accounts for roughly twothirds of the growth in total BAH spending from to Overall payments per recipient increased from about in to about in adjusted to remove the effects of economywide inflation and expressed in dollars Over that period the average annual increase in BAH per recipient was percent higher than the percent growth in the consumer price index for rent of the primary residence CPI for rent and the percent inflation rate in the economy as measured by the gross domestic product price index To illustrate the effect of the growth in BAH CBO calculated the average annual BAH payment that service members with the rank of E would have received between and if BAH payments had grown at the same rate as the prices of rental housing as measured by the CPI for rent see Figure By average payments would have been about percent smallerabout had BAH grown at the rate of the CPI for rent after Assuming that the differences between BAH growth and the CPI for rent of the primary residence for other pay grades were similar to the differences for Es BAH spending would have been roughly billion or about percent less in if it had grown at the rate experienced in rental housing generally since In other words BAH spending in excess of economywide growth in the cost of rental housing was about billion in Figure Comparison of Growth in BAH for Es and Civilian Rental Prices by Calendar Year Thousands of nominal dollars per recipient In BAH per E recipient would have been about percent lower on average if it had grown at the same rate as prices for rental housing in the general economy starting in Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the Department of Defense and the Bureau of Labor Statistics See wwwcbogovpublicationdata BAH basic allowance for housing CPI for rent consumer price index for rent of the primary residence Several changes in DoDs housing policies over the past years increased BAH payments to recipients particularly in the early s First lawmakers authorized a restructuring of housing allowances to eliminate the outofpocket expenses that service members were expected to pay for housing Before BAH payments were required to cover percent of the monthly cost of adequate housing in the area Second allowance rates were more closely linked to increases in local rental rates and finally BAH payments were protected from any declines in those rates As a result of those changes annual increases in housing allowances substantially outpaced changes in the CPI for rent between and For Es BAH grew by percent per year on average during that period whereas annual growth in rental rates in the economy averaged percent In addition amid concerns about differences in housing allowances for service members with and without dependents in the late s DoD raised housing allowances for service members without dependents to equal at least percent of allowances for service members with dependents in the same duty location with the same rank That change also increased average BAH payments Two changes offset some of the growth in BAH per recipient in the s In DoD eliminated the cost of renters insurance from the computation of BAH payments It also reversed the policy of paying for percent of local median rental costs Over a fiveyear implementation period DoD slowed the growth in BAH until in DoD set housing allowances to cover percent of those costs As a result the growth rate of BAH spending per recipient for that period was slightly slower than the growth rate of the CPI for rent The increases in BAH payments to cover a larger share of rental costs from percent to percent resulted in additional costs to DoD of roughly billion in which accounts for percent of BAH spending per recipient in excess of economywide growth in the cost of rental housing How CBO Identified Similar Civilians CBO used the Census Bureaus American Community Survey ACS data from to to determine the type and rental cost of housing that civilians similar to military personnel chose CBO did not include data for civilians who owned their houses because BAH is calculated to cover rental costs not homeownership costs However some military personnel chose to purchase homes and pay for those costs using BAH for more details see Box Box BAH and Home Ownership The Basic Allowance for Housing BAH is intended to offset the rental cost of housing however it can also be used for mortgage payments and many military personnel choose to purchase a home rather than rent one Using data from the American Community Survey ACS from to the Congressional Budget Office found that about percent of service members stationed in the United States owned their own homes When the sample was restricted to only those service members who received full BAH the share was larger at percent Several factors may contribute to whether service members receiving BAH buy or rent their housing First the military lifestylefor example regularly moving throughout ones careerprobably affects service members decisions about whether they purchase a home The costs associated with buying or selling a home when changing assignments could make owning relatively costly when compared with renting Although those service members might be able to rent their homes when they moved to a new duty station doing so also would entail costs and risks that service members might want to avoid Second service members age and marital status affect their housing decisions Military homeowners on average were six years older than the general military population over the period and were more likely to be married Just over percent of all service members were married compared with percent of service members who were homeowners Those older service members might be able to remain at a location for more than one tour or they might plan to reside at the location after leaving military service Third the decision of service members to own or rent a home could also be correlated with higher household income if for example they have a spouse with another income However spouses of military homeowners were only slightly more likely to work than those of service members who rented Data from the ACS suggest that service members who chose to purchase a home with their BAH payment often did not rely on a second income to cover ownership costs Fourth general considerations relevant to all potential homeowners also affected service members housing decisions Homeowners assume a host of responsibilities and risks in terms of time and moneysuch as upkeep and property value depreciationthat renters do not Homeownership also carries benefits however including capital appreciation of the housing The relative weight of those costs and benefits differs for each owner or renter Additionally although homeowners do not pay rent they would probably make a monthly mortgage payment BAH payments are calibrated according to median rental costs and do not necessarily reflect the costs of home ownership in an area Monthly mortgage costs are affected by the down payment and interest rate paid by the borrower Those factors are partially offset by the home loan guarantee program of the Department of Veterans Affairs VA which allows eligible service members to obtain mortgage loans with more favorable terms Also VA loans do not generally require a down payment thereby enabling more military personnel to purchase homes To identify civilians similar to service members at specific pay grades CBO used two approaches Under the first approach CBO identified civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of military personnel at each pay grade CBO considered age and education in part because both reflect a persons human capital their skills knowledge and experience and consequently influence their potential earnings Both older workers and workers with higher levels of education typically have higher earnings Additionally those demographic characteristics affect peoples lives in many ways including how they make decisions about employment and housing However DoD selects more skilled or able recruits among high school graduates as evidenced by their aboveaverage scores on national aptitude tests physical fitness exams and other entrance criteria Because age and education do not account for the standards required to enter military service the median salary of civilians with similar age and education profiles is likely to be lower than that of their military counterparts As a result the types of housing that group of civilians selects are on average probably smaller than the military standard and median rents for that group are likely to be lower than BAH Under the second approach CBO identified civilians with personal income similar to the average income that service members received at each pay grade CBO considered income for two reasons First it is an important component in determining peoples choices for housing and second DoD is required to provide housing allowances that reflect the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable levels of income in the same area Using income to compare military personnel and civilians also has limitations however First civilians with similar income tend to be older and have more education than military personnel Second enlisted service members are paid at about the th percentile of the earnings of civilians with similar demographic characteristics service members would have lower earnings if they were paid at DoDs benchmark of the th percentile In addition research has shown that when holding factors such as the standardized test scores in the Armed Forces Qualification Test fixed military personnel earn more than civilians with similar characteristics In other words median salaries of military personnel would probably have been lower had they been civilians How CBO Compared Data for Civilian Housing and Military Housing Areas Housing data summarized at a national level may obscure large differences in where service members and civilians live as well as regional variations in housing thus CBO compared civilian housing data at the MHA level However geographic units in the ACS do not align with MHAs so CBO used a weighting method to distribute the population within each geographic unit to each of the MHAs it overlaps with To determine how much similar civilians paid for rent and utilities CBO used the rental costs they reported in the ACS That is the agency used occupied rental units to compare costs of rent and utilities with BAH payments CBO did not exclude some housing units that DoD might deem unsuitable when calculating median rental prices See the appendix for more details How Civilian Housing Choices Compare With Military Housing Standards DoDs policy of fixing one housing standard for all geographic regions allows service members of the same pay grade and family status to live in similar housing no matter where they are stationed although they are free to choose other housing types That practice permits service members to rent similar housing if they move to a different posting However the policy does not account for the fact that people tend to rent different types of housing in different geographic regions depending in part on the relative prices of goods and services there When housing costs are relatively expensive people tend to reduce the quantity of housing they consume and increase their purchases of other goods and services To gauge whether DoDs fixed housing standards broadly reflect the housing choices of comparable civilians CBO examined the types of housing that civilians rent in high middle and lowcost housing areas Military installations where large numbers of activeduty personnel are stationed are represented in each of the cost areas although most MHAs with large numbers of activeduty personnel are not in the highestcost areas For example Fort Bliss and Fort Cavazos formerly Fort Hood have large populations of activeduty service members and are located in lowcost areas in Texas San Diego California and the Washington DC metropolitan area are two of the exceptions They both have many military installations with some of the largest populations of military personnel and are in highcost areas CBO found substantial differences between military housing standards and civilians housing choices regardless of the overall cost of housing for the area Housing Choices Made by Civilians With Age and Education Profiles Similar to Those of Military Personnel BAH rates for Es with dependents are based on the cost of renting a twobedroom townhouse or duplex CBO found that on average only about percent of civilians who were comparable to Es with dependents in terms of age and education rented such homes Instead their housing choices varied considerably see Figure top panel Figure Housing Rented by Civilians Similar to Es With Dependents to Percent Although the housing standard was the same across MHAs the types of housing that civilians similar to Es rented varied widely Civilians in highcost areas typically chose smaller housing units than the standard and civilians in lowercost housing areas rented larger units than civilians in highercost areas did Only a small fraction of civilians rented housing that matched the military housing standard Civilians with income equivalent to Es with dependents rented larger housing units than civilians who were demographically similar to Es did because the cash compensation of Es was higher than the median income of civilians with similar demographic characteristics Cash compensation of Es was also higher than DoDs benchmark Notes Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from the American Community Survey See wwwcbogovpublicationdata To identify lowcost and highcost MHAs CBO calculated the cost of housing in an MHA on the basis of the rental costs including utilities paid by people between the ages of and for a twobedroom apartment The agency then ranked MHAs by median rent and considered those MHAs in the lowest quartile of median rent as lowcost housing areas and those in the highest quartile as highcost areas The distribution of housing rented by civilians was calculated within each MHA and then averaged across high and lowcost MHAs to derive the reported distributions CBO did not weight each MHA by its activeduty or civilian population CBOs sample included civilians who were married had dependent children or both and who were employed full time Civilians who were similar to Es in age and education were between the ages of and and had a high school diploma or some college education Civilians who were similar to Es by income were between the ages of and and had income equal to regular military compensation RMC plus or minus percent CBO calculated local RMC rates by replacing the national average BAH payment with MHAspecific BAH rates The sample included civilians who rented all types of housing that were available except for studio apartments boats RVs and tents none of which were common in most MHAs BAH basic allowance for housing DoD Department of Defense MHA military housing area a Includes most types of housing other than DoDs housing standards such as three and fourbedroom apartments mobile homes and twobedroom singlefamily homes Most housing in that category was larger than the housing standard for Es with dependents Because military housing standards remain the same across MHAs the patterns in civilian housing choices suggest that service members in highcost areas were generally able to rent housing that was larger than that of their civilian counterparts whether they had similar age and education profiles or similar income Averaged over the MHAs nearly half of Eequivalent civilians rented smaller units defined as one or twobedroom apartments than the military housing standard Typically civilians rented relatively smaller housing units in more expensive MHAs than they did in less expensive ones Nearly percent of civilians comparable to Es with dependents in highcost areas rented units that were smaller than a twobedroom townhouse or duplex compared with about percent of those in lowcost MHAs In highcost areas about percent of civilians rented larger homes defined as threebedroom townhomes or three or fourbedroom singlefamily homes than the military housing standard in lowcost areas more than percent of civilians did so The difference between high and lowcost areas was even greater when considering all housing larger than the DoD housing standards That category also included three and fourbedroom apartments and townhomes and twobedroom single family homes which make up a large share of the other category Differences in housing choices in highcost and lowcost areas were also evident for civilians who were comparable with service members of other military ranks However a smaller share of older civilians or civilians equivalent to service members of higher military ranks rented one or twobedroom apartments than did younger civilians That held true in high and lowcost areas Housing Choices Made by Civilians With Income Similar to That of Military Personnel DoD requires that military housing standards reflect the housing types normally occupied by civilians of comparable income However as was the case for civilians with similar age and education profiles few civilians with comparable incomealso percentrented housing that corresponded to the military housing standard for Es with dependents Although about percent of civilians with income equivalent to Es rented housing smaller than the standard they were more likely than civilians with comparable age and education profiles to rent larger units than the military housing standard see Figure bottom panel Factors Influencing Civilians Housing Choices With both types of comparisons CBO found that the types of housing rented by civilians similar to Es with dependents varied widely and that the percentage of civilians who rented homes at the military housing standard was relatively small It is not surprising to find such a wide variety of housing occupied by renters Two factors may help explain those findings individual preferences and total household income First people have different priorities when choosing housingsome are willing to pay more of their income than other people for some attributes such as high quality local schools or a larger property Other people in order to afford larger homes may be willing to sacrifice in other ways For instance some of the rentals that CBO classified as larger could be older less wellmaintained or in less popular neighborhoods Although the type of housing people chose to rent varied in some cases the cost of that housing could be similar to the BAH rates assigned to the relevant military housing standard CBO could not determine from ACS data the desirability of the different types of housing that civilians chose Second some households included in the ACS had dual incomes and some had single incomes DoD sets its BAH rates on a service members income but housing decisions are based in part on household income which may include more than one income As household income increases housing expenditures generally also increase Civilians who were part of dualincome families might have rented larger homes than military housing standards because their household income exceeded that of similar service members To examine the effect dual incomes had on civilians housing choices CBO analyzed the distribution of housing by single and dualincome families separately The agency found that percent of Eequivalent civilians with working spouses rented singlefamily homes with three or four bedrooms whereas about percent of those households with only one income did so Either comparison might be considered appropriate so CBO included both single and dualincome households in its primary analysis On the one hand DoD service members are less likely to have spouses who work in the paid labor force and those who do earn less than comparable civilians Consequently total income in service members households might not be as high as that in comparable civilians households If the military lifestyle makes working less feasible for spouses some might argue that housing allowances should compare to what dualincome families pay in rent On the other hand service members earn more than most civilians of similar age and with similar education in which case military housing standards and BAH payments may partially or wholly offset the effect of dual incomes on civilians housing choices How Median Civilian Rents Compare With BAH BAH rates vary by location so CBO also examined whether those rates matched the median rents that comparable civilians paid To do so the agency determined the median rental costs for comparable civilians in each MHA and then calculated the percentage difference between that and BAH CBO found that within individual MHAs the amount of BAH that DoD paid to service members was usually larger than the median rental rates for comparable civiliansunder both methods CBO used to define civilian equivalents That percentage difference was on average largest in those locations with the highest BAH rates and those with the highest average rental costs For an example of how housing choices and rental rates varied by pay grade within a specific MHA Norfolk Virginia see Box Box Case Study Norfolk Virginia The types of housing civilians choose to rent and the associated costs can vary considerably by military housing area MHA That variation is based in part on the local markets supply of rental housing the relative prices of goods and peoples preferences The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the housing choices of civilians in Norfolk Virginia to compare civilian housing choices with military housing standards and the associated basic allowance for housing BAH rates for service members at multiple pay grades CBO chose Norfolk Virginia in part because it is home to one of the Navys largest bases The MHA surrounding Norfolk has a relatively large activeduty population of roughly and a civilian population of over million In addition its overall cost of housing was in the middle of the national distribution in CBO examined the housing choices made by three groups

Civilians At least percent of civilians with age and education profiles similar to those of Es rented housing that was smaller one or twobedroom apartments than the military housing standard of a twobedroom townhouse and more than percent rented housing larger than the Department of Defenses DoDs standard see first table The difference persisted but was smaller for Eequivalent civilians at least percent of comparable civilians rented housing that was smaller than the standard for that pay grade a threebedroom townhouse or duplex Relatively few Es or Es rented housing similar to their respective standard only percent of Es and percent of Es The share of E and Eequivalent civilians residing in housing larger than the DoD standards increased substantially when CBO compared civilians with military personnel based on income That share increased further when considering all housing larger than the DoD housing standards contained in the other category Those patterns are similar to those at the national level In the broader analysis CBO did not focus on Es because there were very few similar civilians for comparison most civilians comparable to Es had roommates But for completeness the agency did analyze that group for Norfolk Most Es without dependents in the military are between the ages of and BAH rates allow those service members to rent their housing standarda onebedroom apartmentwithout requiring a roommate however most civilians comparable to Es seek out roommates In Norfolk nearly percent of civilians comparable to Es in terms of age and education reported living with a roommate or family member In this analysis CBO restricted the civilian sample to renters who did not report living with roommates or family members to better compare civilian housing outcomes with the military standard However civilians without roommates probably earned more than civilians with roommates and therefore CBOs sample presumably included a relatively large share of people who chose larger housing Monthly BAH for Service Members at Various Pay Grades and Median Rental Costs for Similar Civilians in Norfolk Virginia to dollars Notes Data source

age and education was used as the metric Rental Costs for Civilians With Age and Education Profiles Similar to Those of Military Personnel CBO found that BAH rates were higher than the median rent of civilians with similar age and education profiles in almost all MHAs That relationship suggests that DoD may be offering larger housing allowances on average than necessary to meet retention goals Averaged over all MHAs in CBOs sample of civilians with similar demographic characteristics the monthly BAH payment for Es in was whereas the median rental cost for civilians was a difference of percent MHAs with the highest BAH rates had on average larger differences between BAH and what civilians paid for rent and utilities than MHAs with the lowest BAH rates see Figure left panel In the quarter of MHAs with the highest BAH payments BAH rates for Es were percent higher than their civilian median rental costs By contrast in the quarter of MHAs with the lowest BAH payments BAH rates for

more difficult for military spouses to work In that case DoD may make up for lower spousal income with a housing allowance that allows service members to afford the same housing as dualincome families CBO found that civilians living in dualincome households spent about more per month on housing than those living in singleincome households reducing the percentage gap between BAH for Es with dependents and median civilian rental costs over all MHAs in the sample from percent to percent on average Rental Costs for Civilians With Income Similar to That of Military Personnel CBO found that a gap between civilian rental costs and BAH payments persisted but was smaller for civilians with income similar to that of Es with dependents because median rent including utilities was higher for those civilians than it was for civilians with age and education profiles similar to those service members Averaged over all MHAs in CBOs sample of civilians with similar income the monthly BAH payment for Es in was compared with the median monthly rental cost of for civilians with similar income a difference of percent The difference tended to be larger on average in areas with the highest BAH rates and smaller in areas with the lowest BAH rates see Figure right panel In the quarter of MHAs with the largest housing allowances BAH rates for Es were percent higher than the median rental costs paid by civilians with similar income Among the quarter of MHAs with the lowest housing allowances BAH rates were percent higher than the median rental costs for civilians Though variation in the percentage difference was large across locations regardless of the BAH rates that variation was smaller for civilians with comparable income than for civilians with comparable age and education profiles see Figure In addition rental costs exceeded BAH in fewer than percent of MHAs Under the income approach the number of observations was too small to calculate the difference in median rental costs by singleincome households and dualincome households in the civilian sector However if the same difference per month applied to the income approach as under the demographic approach the percentage gap between BAH and median rental costs would drop from roughly percent to percent How BAH and Median Civilian Rental Costs Differ by MHAs Characteristics CBO also examined whether some attributes of the MHAs were associated with the percentage differences between BAH payments and median rents including utilities To do so CBO considered the correlation between the percentage difference in BAH and civilian rental costs using three measures the overall cost of housing in an MHA the number of service members living in the MHA and the total population of the MHA CBO found that in MHAs where rental costs were most expensive the percentage difference between BAH for Es with dependents and the median rental costs of civilians of similar age and education paid was also disproportionately large About percent of the highestcost MHAs were in the top quarter of differences between BAH and civilian rental costs for those who were similar to Es in age and education levels For example Washington DC was in the largest difference group but the Honolulu Hawaii MHA had relatively small percentage differences between BAH and median civilian housing costs About percent of the areas with the lowest overall costs of housing were in locations with the smallest percentage differences The same relationships held true for civilians with income similar to that of Es BAH rates may differ substantially from median civilian rental costs in highcost areas for a variety of reasons Highcost MHAs often span large metropolitan areas and a greater share of rental units may be excluded from DoDs price calculations in those urban settings if a large share of rental housing is of low quality or in areas with crime rates above the national average Moreover DoDs rental surveys primarily include rental units that are on the market at the time the survey was conducted Data show that the annual growth in rental costs for recent movers is higher than that for longterm tenants The difference in rental prices for new tenants and other renters may be larger in more expensive locations Under both definitions of similar civilians CBO found that BAH rates in MHAs associated with large military installations and correspondingly large numbers of service members stationed there were more closely aligned with median civilian rental costs than those in MHAs with few service members That correlation mitigates some of the additional costs DoD would have incurred had all large installations been located in highcost MHAs CBO also found that the larger the share of service members of total population in an MHA the more similar BAH rates were to civilians cost of housing It is unclear whether DoD does a better job matching housing market prices in those areas or if BAH has an outsized effect on market rates in those areas It is possible that BAH rates might cause local rental rates to rise particularly if the number of service members as a share of the local population was relatively large However evidence of the correlation is limited Factors Affecting BAH Rates and Estimates of Median Civilian Rental Costs Estimates of civilian rental costs and consequently BAH rates are sensitive to the way those costs are calculated Several factors affect the calculation of median rental costs how comparable civilians are defined how rental housing is identified what criteria are used to exclude housing units how geographic areas used for comparison are defined and how limitations inherent in surveys are handled First how similar civilians are defined can provide higher or lower estimates of their median rent Second in determining the BAH rate for an MHA DoD surveys the cost of vacant rentals on the market which may not be the same as the cost for occupied rentals Research by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that people who move have a larger increase in annual rental costs than those who do not DoDs method may better align BAH to the rental costs faced by service members who move to a new duty station By contrast CBO calculated the cost of rental housing using the median rental costs for occupied housing those costs may be lower than the costs paid by people who move The agency did not adjust for that difference however because civilians who are the same age as Es move at roughly the same frequency that service members do about onethird in a given year suggesting that rates based on vacant rentals may overstate rental costs for those who have been in their units for a year or more Third DoDs criteria for the inclusion or exclusion of a housing unit in its surveys probably affects BAH rates Eliminating lowercost housing choices available to civilians either by excluding less desirable neighborhoods or smaller types of housing results in higher estimates of median rental costs and consequently higher BAH rates than would have occurred without the restrictions However not all inclusions or exclusions appear to change the median rents substantially For instance the inclusion or exclusion of studio apartments and mobile homes made very little difference in CBOs findingsthe median civilian rental costs changed by less than percent Fourth the estimation of civilians rental costs is sensitive to the boundaries of an MHA Not surprisingly expanding or constricting the area can lead to variation in the median rents calculated and subsequent BAH payments For instance eight geographic areas in the ACS feed into the Norfolk Virginia MHA either wholly or partially The difference in civilian rental costs between the highest and lowestcost areas was roughly percent Finally small sample sizes and data anomalies associated with surveys can affect the calculation of median rental costs For a particular housing standard DoD often cannot find enough vacant units to meet its sampling goal generally to units In about percent of MHAs DoD could not survey enough rental units at the E housing standard to meet its minimum sample target in To mitigate that problem DoD uses additional methods to calculate BAH rates such as data from previous years and allows the substitution of housing types at some anchor points Those substitutions tend to increase the rental costs that DoD calculates and the BAH that it pays

product as an indicator of the performance of an economy visvis how it impacts our wellbeing as individuals or a society GDP is frustrating to econ profs It is a crucial indicator subject to wide misunderstanding Intro students must learn it is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy But then may of them forget the details We teach that output is an important indicator In a th century phrase the objective of production is consumption People cannot have goods and services to meet their needs or wants unless someone produces them All else being equal its assumed the greater the value of output the more it is possible that a population can be better off But there are numerous caveats Professors spend hours explaining the limitations of GDP as an indicator What it doesnt tell us about an economy What can it measure and what shouldnt we assume it tells us Students dutifully write litany on exams Unfortunately journalists politicians and sundry pundits dont take our courses or have forgotten this section So one reads assertions like economists agree that GDP is by far the best measure of how an economy is performing No we dont agree on that In years I have never heard any economist say that GDP is a measure very useful when taken in context with other indicators and when one is mindful of what is not being measured For example the adjective final in the above GDP definition means no double counting The hamburger we buy at the driveup window is counted but not the wheat and flour that went into the bun nor the cattle feed and the steer that formed the ground beef We count the whole F truck but not iron ore steel glass plastic and rubber Gross in the definition means the value of all the new final goods produced in a nation Theres no deduction for past production that wore out or was discarded New cars appliances and computers are added up Ones crushed for scrap are not subtracted Do that and you have net national product important but seldom cited Nor are adjustments made for resources used up in the production process We have produced much grain but there is less water in the Ogallala aquifer We produced millions of tons of steel but have deleted Minnesotas highgrade iron ore Housing production is up but thousands of square miles of white pine are gone Also of critical importance the final figure makes no adjustment for external costs in producing the goods Consider biologically dead streams downhill from old copper mines poor children growing up near petrochemical plants with shamefully high rates of serious health problems fewer and poorer shellfish in Chesapeake Bay and Louisiana bayous cities choked with smog Moreover market value is not wellbeing A tycoon buying a million yacht counts the same in GDP as million spent on sewers in rural Mississippi Millions spent lavishly furnishing a squarefoot Manhattan apartment adds the same to GDP as equal amounts upgrading nursing homes And sometimes rising GDP can indicate we are worse off If we all boozed it up and caused fatal DUI crashes output from towing services ambulances body shops orthopedic surgeons and morticians would rise and so would GDP Does all this mean GDP is a terrible measure No It remains highly useful as long as one uses it in context Now what about my carcinoma This falls in the category of the positive things GDP fails to catch such as everlowering costs for maintaining and even bettering the public good Consider that a heart attack killed my dad weeks after my conception Dr Van Solkema came by twice but could do nothing Today a high tech ambulance would have whisked dad downtown CPR performed along the way stents or a pacemaker would have been put in and he would have been alive to dandle

how millions of people were near blind in their s because cataract operations were difficult of limited effectiveness and expensive The point with regard to GDP is that only the dollar cost of stents

would be dampened Cruise said Property and consumption woes The property market is also a major drag Property investment slumped in the first quarter from a year ago according to NBS data New property sales slid during the same period Separately new home prices in cities fell in March from a year earlier which was faster than Februarys drop according to Goldman Sachs calculation based on the NBS latest data release The property markets woes are continuing Cruise said The embattled property market is weighing on consumer spending as of Chinese household wealth is tied to real estate Weak job prospects and economic uncertainty are also holding back household spending In March retail sales growth slowed to from in February According to the NBS data household confidence for employment and

machine manufacturing autos and artificial intelligence as complaints from the EU grow about the proliferation of Chinese products A day before Scholz said Germany welcomed imports of Chinese cars but warned against dumping overproduction and intellectual property infringements according to Reuters Last month Xi met with more than a dozen US CEOs and academics in Beijing and invited them to

investment in China has slumped in recent months as a combination of slower growth regulatory crackdowns onerous national security legislation and questions about the countrys longterm prospects have shaken confidence in the worlds second biggest economy The strong firstquarter growth figure goes a long way in achieving Chinas around target for the year But mediumterm growth prospects hinge on

Tokyo CPI Apr US PCE Mar Note Previews are listed in day order Bitcoin Halving Event Sat The Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years at every blocks mined in which the reward for mining new blocks is halved The mechanism is built into the code of Bitcoin to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are generated Since Bitcoin aims for a block generation time of minutes the halving events are roughly spaced four years apart The specific date and time are based on the current average block generation time being maintained at minutes Desks suggest the halving will occur between April st The Block estimates April th at around ET BST as things stand Historically halvings precede periods of price increases due to the anticipated reduction in new bitcoin supply However each halving occurs under unique market conditions Factors surrounding this cycle include the fact BTC hit fresh ATHs earlier this year which led to speculation that the market may have already priced in the halvings effects a diversion from the pattern observed in prior halving cycles where significant price action occurred posthalving The recent introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has seen substantial inflows significantly impacting the demand and subsequently the price of Bitcoin Bitcoin available to trade ie the difference between circulating and illiquid supply has been in decline since early a major shift from previous cycles according to Coinbase ie more people are holding onto Bitcoins than trading it The halving comes at a time when market expectations for rate cuts are being pushed further out The investor sentiment aspect of rate cut expectations adds another layer of complexity to this halving cycle PBoC LPR Mon The PBoC kept its Year Mediumterm Lending Facility Rate unchanged at as widely expected and opted again not to fully roll over expiring funds as it conducted CNY bln in year MLF loans vs CNY bln maturing while this serves as a fairly accurate indicator for Chinas benchmark Loan Prime Rates next week As a reminder the central bank unsurprisingly maintained the year LPR at last month which is the rate on which most new loans are based on while it also kept the year LPR at which is the reference rate for mortgages The central banks actions since then have continued to point to a lack of urgency for adjustments in shortterm funding rates with daily open market operations mostly kept to within modest amounts while the latest data releases from China have been mixed which also supports the case for no immediate rate changes as Chinese GDP in Q topped forecasts with YY growth of exp but activity data disappointed with Industrial Production in March YY at exp and Retail Sales YY at exp Furthermore recent CPI data was softerthanexpected and PPI remained in deflation while China continues to struggle with the ongoing property sector woes and house prices continued to decline This suggests future support measures cannot be ruled out and the PBoC had previously vowed to help consolidate and strengthen the economic recovery as well as noted there is still room for cutting RRR and that they have sufficient room for monetary policy EZ Flash PMI Tue Expectations are for the manufacturing PMI to nudge higher to from and services to rise to from leaving the composite at vs prev The prior release emphasised the diverging fortunes of the services and manufacturing sectors with the latter delving deeper into contractionary territory The accompanying report noted the euro area economy moved back into expansion territory at the end of the first quarter halting a sequence of contraction stretching back to June last year This time around analysts at Investec highlight a potential uptick in the manufacturing sector given that the previous release revealed the smallest decline in output since April whilst the desk expects the service sector to be aided by an easing in costofliving pressures From a policy perspective the release will likely not have too much sway on ECB pricing given how firmly expectations are anchored for a June cut If a reduction in June was to be repriced it would likely be more a result of a spike in energy prices which threatens the Eurozone inflation outlook as opposed to anything contained within the PMI series UK Flash PMI Tue Expectations are for the services PMI to tick lower to from with the manufacturing print forecast at vs prev The prior release saw the services print pullback but remain in expansionary territory whilst the manufacturing metric moved back into positive territory for the first time since July The accompanying release noted the solid growth rate achieved in March reinforces the view that a rebound in service sector performance is helping the UK economy to pull out of last years shallow recession This time around analysts at Investec think that the prior release overstated the strength in the manufacturing sector and subsequently look for a move back into contractionary territory at In the services sector the desk sees little reason to expect a material move from the level printed in March More broadly on the UK economy analysts note our expectation is for a modest rather than a robust recovery in the economy adding that the impact of the NIC reduction is unlikely to show up in the PMI series given that it does not cover the retail sector From a policy perspective the release will likely not have too much sway on pricing at the BoE as MPC officials remain primarily focused on services inflation and earnings growth Australian CPI Wed Monthly Weighted CPI for March is seen matching the February figure of The desk at Westpac expects the monthly figure to print at as they expect to see prices rise in the month for food alcohol tobacco housing mostly due to rents and dwellings auto fuel health auto fuel and finance insurance Prices are expected to fall in the month for garments and holiday travel whilst also keeping an eye on the momentum in the core metrics which exclude volatile items and holiday travel QQ CPI for Q is seen ticking higher to vs in Q while the YY is seen cooling to prev with base effects cited for the latters steep fall Analysts at Westpac suggest that food prices remain inflationary while the main disinflationary pressures emanate from falling household contents and falling clothing and footwear prices but the desks also highlight that Services remain the key inflationary risk with market services excluding volatile items forecast to lift CBRT Announcement Thu There are currently no expectations for what the CBRT may opt to do at next weeks meeting This comes after the central bank hiked rates last month by bps surpassing the topend of analyst expectations with the statement citing a deteriorating outlook and pledging to tighten even further if it expects the price situation to worsen significantly Since then the latest Turkish CPI metrics have been softer than expected with the YY for March printing at prev while MM printed at prev Turkish Governor spoke at the IMF this week and suggested the central bank has shown how serious it is about ensuring disinflation which remains its main priority whilst adding that the country is on track to reach its yearend inflation target Our strategy going forward is that our utmost priority is disinflation and we will accumulate reserves as much as we can depending on market conditions the central bank head said We have done a lot and are ready to do more to regain credibility and reestablish the policy rate as the primary tool US Q GDP Thu The first estimate of Q GDP is expected to show growth cooling to from in Q although analyst forecasts currently range between and Meanwhile the latest Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimate for Q growth is at The US ISM data has seen the services sector remain in expansionary territory throughout Q but it eased from in January to in February and in March The manufacturing side has been mixed the ISM manufacturing headline in January was but eased to in February before accelerating back into expansionary territory of in March Consumer spending proxies have been mixed January retail sales disappointed but saw an improvement in February although the Retail Control component was flat Meanwhile the March report however was strong across the board There will also be attention on the Q PCE data but the inflation data so far in Q has been on the hot side of expectations and has led to a shift in Fed expectations Analysts at Moodys look for GDP to come in beneath but note this should not be a concern given that recent growth was clearly unsustainable Note in regards to prices the March PCE data released on Friday will provide a more timely update on inflation BoJ Announcement and Outlook Report Fri The central bank is likely to maintain its policy settings after its monumental policy shift at the last meeting in March As such the focus at the upcoming meeting will likely be on the central banks statement for clues on future policy and its tolerance regarding the recent JPY weakness while the central bank will also release its Outlook Report containing Board Members latest median estimates for Real GDP and Core CPI As a reminder the BoJ exited its negative interest policy and YCC at the last meeting in which it switched to guiding the overnight call rate in the range of and will apply a interest to all excess reserves parked at the BoJ while it also announced to end ETF and JREIT buying and will gradually reduce the amount of purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds However it said it would continue its JGB purchases at broadly the same amount as before and in the event of a rapid rise in longterm rates it would make nimble responses with JGB purchases and could increase the amount of JGB purchases or conduct fixedrate purchase operations of JGBs It also announced it is to provide loans under the Fund Provisioning Measure to stimulate bank lending with such funds to be provided with an interest rate of and have a year duration Despite the exit from the ultraloose policy framework the central bank noted that it expects to maintain an accommodative monetary environment for the time being and Governor Ueda also said during the postmeeting press conference that they will consider options for easing broadly including ones used in the past if needed but kept future hikes on the table with the pace of further hikes to depend on the economy and price outlooks The rhetoric from the central bank since then suggests a lack of urgency for any immediate adjustment as Governor Ueda stated it is important to maintain accommodative monetary conditions with trend inflation yet to hit and that even after the March policy shift interest rates are expected to stay low with real interest rates to remain in deeply negative territory while he noted they will likely gradually shrink the balance sheet as they end their massive stimulus and at some point reduce JGB purchases but had no clear idea on the timing of reducing JGB buying and scaling back the size of the balance sheet Furthermore he said they are not immediately thinking of selling the BoJs ETF holdings and will take plenty of time to examine how to reduce BoJs ETF holdings while there is also no plan to sell their JREIT holdings anytime soon This suggests the central bank will likely remain patient and refrain from any further adjustments in the near term although participants will be looking out for any clues of the central banks future policy intentions and its tolerance regarding the recent currency depreciation after the yen slid to its weakest level in years against the dollar As such Governor Ueda previously stated that they wont change monetary policy just to deal directly with FX moves but suggested they may need to respond with monetary policy if FX moves have an impact on the economy and prices in a way that is hard to ignore and if FX moves lead not just to rising import prices but risk pushing up trend inflation more than expected In terms of the Outlook Report a recent source report stated the BoJ will discuss raising the forecast for fiscal on the back of a rise in crude prices and higher costs of imported materials due to a weaker yen while the central bank is said to forecast an increase of about in Core CPI for fiscal with projections to reflect changes in behaviour over businesses wage hikes and price setting although sources also noted that while the central bank is expected to project inflation to stay around its target through early such forecasts alone wont serve as strong hints of a nearterm rate hike Japanese Tokyo CPI Fri Tokyos Core CPI for April is seen cooling to from in March The data serves as a precursor to the National figures released a couple of weeks later This particular release will likely be overlooked and overshadowed as it falls on the same day as the BoJ policy announcement outlook report and press conference Analysts at ING say Tokyo CPI should remain choppy Headline inflation is likely to cool quite sharply to below yearoveryear mainly due to last years high base though we expect it to rebound again in May Slower CPI inflation could give the Bank room to pause on its decision to raise rates for a few more months US PCE Fri The consensus looks for US headline PCE to rise MM in March in line with the prior months reading The core rate of PCE is also seen rising by MM matching the prior rise too Writing after the March CPI And PPI WSJs Fedwatcher Nick Timiraos said the March core PCE index probably rose MM according to the forecasters who infer what the PCE data may look like based on the monthly CPI and PPI data he added that the annual rate would ease to YY from in February and that would see the sixmonth annualised rate a key gauge watched by the Fed fall to from in February Traders will be attentive to any upside in the readings after Fed officials recently reminded us that they still have the capacity to lift rates if inflation progress reverses Feds Williams voter said that rate hikes were not within his baseline forecast but if data called for higher rates then the Fed would hike Feds Bowman voter noted that inflation progress has stalled and while it was unlikely it is still possible that the Fed may have to hike rates again to cool inflation Other officials have been reiterating that rate cuts would hinge on incoming data where inflation readings have been surprising to the upside in the first quarter of this year money markets are now pricing in around bps of rate cuts this year as progress towards bringing inflation towards target experiences some bumps and as Fed officials talk a hawkish game markets were pricing in around bps of rate cuts around a month ago Conversely any downside in the March PCE data may help to price in more rate cuts This article originally appeared on Newsquawk,Newsquawk Week

to depend on the economy and price outlooks The rhetoric from the central bank since then suggests a lack of urgency for any immediate adjustment as Governor Ueda stated it is important to maintain accommodative monetary conditions with trend inflation yet to hit and that even after the March policy shift interest rates are expected to stay low with real interest rates to remain in deeply negative territory while he noted they will likely gradually shrink the balance sheet as they end their massive stimulus and at some point reduce JGB purchases but had no clear idea on the timing of reducing JGB buying and scaling back the size of the balance sheet Furthermore he said they are not immediately thinking of selling the BoJs ETF holdings and will take plenty of time to examine how to reduce BoJs ETF holdings while there is also no plan to sell their JREIT holdings anytime soon This suggests the central bank will likely remain patient and refrain from any further adjustments in the near term although participants will be looking out for any clues of the central banks future policy intentions and its tolerance regarding the recent currency depreciation after the yen slid to its weakest level in years against the dollar As such Governor Ueda previously stated that they wont change monetary policy just to deal directly with FX moves but suggested they may need to respond with monetary policy if FX moves have an impact on the economy and prices in a way that is hard to ignore and if FX moves lead not just to rising import prices but risk pushing up trend inflation more than expected In terms of the Outlook Report a recent source report stated the BoJ will discuss raising the forecast for fiscal on the back of a rise in crude prices and higher costs of imported materials due to a weaker yen while the central bank is said to forecast an increase of about in Core CPI for fiscal with projections to reflect changes in behaviour over businesses wage hikes and price setting although sources also noted that while the central bank is expected to project inflation to stay around its target through early such forecasts alone wont serve as strong hints of a nearterm rate hike Japanese Tokyo CPI Fri Tokyos Core CPI for April is seen cooling to from in March The data serves as a precursor to the National figures released a couple of weeks later This particular release will likely be overlooked and overshadowed as it falls on the same day as the BoJ policy announcement outlook report and press conference Analysts at ING say Tokyo CPI should remain choppy Headline inflation is likely to cool quite sharply to below yearoveryear mainly due to last years high base though we expect it to rebound again in May Slower CPI inflation could give the Bank room to pause on its decision to raise rates for a few more months US PCE Fri The consensus looks for US headline PCE to rise MM in March in line with the prior months reading The core rate of PCE is also seen rising by MM matching the prior rise too Writing after the March CPI And PPI WSJs Fedwatcher Nick Timiraos said the March core PCE index probably rose MM according to the forecasters who infer what the PCE data may look like based on the monthly CPI and PPI data he added that the annual rate would ease to YY from in February and that would see the sixmonth annualised rate a key gauge watched by the Fed fall to from in February Traders will be attentive to any upside in the readings after Fed officials recently reminded us that they still have the capacity to lift rates if inflation progress reverses Feds Williams voter said that rate hikes were not within his baseline forecast but if data called for higher rates then the Fed would hike Feds Bowman voter noted that inflation progress has stalled and while it was unlikely it is still possible that the Fed may have to hike rates again to cool inflation Other officials have been reiterating that rate cuts would hinge on incoming data where inflation readings have been surprising to the upside in the first quarter of this year money markets are now pricing in around bps of rate cuts this year as progress towards bringing inflation towards target experiences some bumps and as Fed officials talk a hawkish game markets were pricing in around bps of rate cuts around a month ago Conversely any downside in the March PCE data may help to price in more rate cuts This article originally appeared on Newsquawk

apparent acceleration and positive momentum in economic activities with Chinas firstquarter gross domestic product rising per cent from a year earlier and growing by per cent from the previous quarter

consumption retail sales data for March which was also published along with the GDP figures indicated a continued slowdown in growth in this area Jens Eskelund president of the European Union Chamber

policymakers have introduced a tradein plan emphasising home appliances and automobiles Yearonyear growth of retail sales a key gauge of consumption moderated to per cent in March from per cent growth in combined figures for January and February the NBS said on Tuesday It is uncertain to what extent German companies can benefit from this type of growth Maximilian Butek German Chamber of Commerce From Eskelunds perspective a step in the right direction would be for Beijing to offer more support to boost demand in China Supplyside policies have been a contributor to the significant trade imbalances the country has accumulated with both the EU and the US he added European companies also hope to see tangible steps from the Chinese government to tackle regulatory and marketaccess barriers that currently impede the flow of foreign investment into the country Maximilian Butek executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in eastern China also pointed out that consumer confidence in China remains weak It is uncertain to what extent German companies can benefit from this type of growth Butek said Although the firstquarter data showed Beijing on course to meet its

easing is still necessary especially on the demandside eg fiscal housing and consumption Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note citing structural challenges from the property downturn stillfragile

consumption Jens Eskelund EU Chamber of Commerce Chinas capacityutilisation ratio has dropped to a fouryear low at per cent Industrial output in March rose by per cent year on year and surprisingly dropped by per cent on a monthly basis For growth to be sustainable China will need to address a list of structural issues including weak consumption retail sales data for March which was also published along with the GDP figures indicated a continued slowdown in growth in this area Jens Eskelund president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in a written response to questions on Tuesday Beijings policymakers have been pinning high hopes on consumption to drive up and consolidate the economic recovery and policymakers have introduced a tradein plan emphasising home appliances and automobiles Yearonyear growth of retail sales a key gauge of consumption moderated to per cent in March from per cent growth in combined figures for January and February the NBS said on Tuesday It is uncertain to what extent German companies can benefit from this type of growth Maximilian Butek German Chamber of Commerce From Eskelunds perspective a step in the right direction would be for Beijing to offer more support to boost demand in China Supplyside policies have been a contributor to the significant trade imbalances the country has accumulated with both the EU and the US he added European companies also hope to see tangible steps from the Chinese government to tackle regulatory and marketaccess barriers that currently impede the flow of foreign investment into the country Maximilian Butek executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in eastern China also pointed out that consumer confidence in China remains weak It is uncertain to what extent German companies can benefit from this type of growth Butek said Although the firstquarter data showed Beijing on course to meet its fullyear GDP growth target of around per cent analysts suggest policymakers are in a race against time to bolster domestic demand and introduce stronger property support We believe continued policy easing is still necessary especially on the demandside eg fiscal housing and consumption Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note citing structural challenges from the property downturn stillfragile confidence and the deleveraging of local government financing vehicles Ding Shuang chief Greater China economist at Standard Chartered Bank said Beijing should leverage its fiscal tools by timely issuing special treasury and local bonds to support economic growth in the second half of the year Beijing intends to issue trillion yuan US billion worth of ultralongterm special government bonds this year and these will help fund economyboosting initiatives technological innovation and integrated urbanrural development among other purposes Another gauge of investor confidence private investment grew by per cent in the first three months of the year compared with a fall of per cent in Eric Zheng president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai also called for concrete actions to stimulate domestic demand We are pleased to see solid GDP growth in the first quarter a clear indication of momentum in Chinas economic recovery Economic performance is a top factor for our members confidence in the Chinese market he said There is still a need for more targeted policy measures to stimulate demand over the coming months Zheng added noting how consumer and producer price indices have reflected persistent headwinds in domestic demand

Monetary Fund,GDP,Crime and violence have long been a topofmind concern for households across Latin America and the Caribbean The region accounts for nearly half of the worlds intentional homicide victims despite representing just over percent of the global population United Nations data show The average homicide rate in the region is times that of other emerging markets and developing economies and twice as high as subSaharan Africa Within the region Central America stands out as the most violent subregion Insecurity has also worsened over time especially in some parts of the region For example Central America and the Caribbean have experienced annual increases in homicide rates of about percent in the last two decades Crime directly affects the lives of millions of people and imposes large social costs Because there is a delicate interplay between economic activity and crime determining causal effects is not easy More economic activity will reduce crime but less crime would in turn boost economic activity Another factor such as the strength of rule of law will also affect both Our recent study shows that increases in homicide rates significantly reduce economic growth In Latin America a percent increase in homicide rates equivalent to a historical standard deviation is estimated to reduce growth by percentage points We build on previous IMF work on Central America Panama and the Dominican Republic using data on criminal deportations from the US to tease out the causal effect of crime on economic activity Our study highlights the different channels through which insecurity affects economic growth Estimates show that crime hampers capital accumulation by possibly deterring investors who fear theft and violence and decreases productivity as it likely diverts resources toward less productive investments such as home security The benefits of reducing violence can be substantial According to the study bringing the crime level in Latin America down to the world average would increase the regions annual economic growth by percentage points about a third of Latin Americas growth between Moreover confronting insecurity where it is most prevalent seems to have the largest payoffs For example fully closing the crime gap in countries with the highest homicide rates could elevate their gross domestic product growth by around percentage points Smarter spending in security Governments in Latin America are already allocating a considerable share of their resources to public order and safety Not surprisingly higher spending occurs in countries with higher crime ratescountries like El Salvador and Jamaica already spend more than percent of their GDP on this matter While this substantial spending may be necessary to mitigate and deter crime it also suggests that implementing more effective strategies could free up significant resources for other spending priorities The IADBs Security and Justice Evidencebased Platform is a valuable resource for scientific evidence on the effectiveness of existing security and justice solutions The platform highlights for instance that there is little evidence that vehicular license plate recognition technologies reduce transportationrelated violence whereas alcohol tax and price policies are found to effectively reduce violence in some cases Crime is an economic and social issue with farreaching consequences and a variety of intertwined roots If governments in the region were able to prioritize more effective crimefighting strategies these would not only enhance public safety

Associated Press,GDP,WASHINGTON AP The nations economy grew at an unexpectedly brisk annual pace from October through December as Americans showed a continued willingness to spend freely despite high interest rates and price levels that have frustrated many households Thursdays report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product the economys total output of goods and services decelerated from its sizzling growth rate the previous quarter But the latest figures still reflected the surprising durability of the worlds largest economy which US voters are assessing ahead of the November elections The latest data marked the sixth straight quarter in which GDP has grown at an annual pace of or more Consumers who account for about of the total economy drove the growth Their spending expanded at a annual rate for items ranging from clothing furniture recreational vehicles and other goods to services like hotels and restaurant meals The GDP report also showed that despite the robust pace of growth in the OctoberDecember quarter inflationary measures continued to ease Consumer prices rose at a annual rate down from in the third quarter And excluding volatile food and energy prices socalled core inflation came in at a annual rate Those inflation numbers could reassure the Federal Reserves policymakers who have already signaled that they expect to cut their benchmark interest rate three times in reversing their policy of aggressively raising rates to fight inflation Some economists think the Fed could begin cutting rates as early as May Nathan Sheets global chief economist at Citi said that recent experience suggests that economic growth can remain solid even as inflation cools It underscores for the Fed that they dont have to be in a hurry to ease borrowing rates to aid the economy said Sheets who thinks the first rate cut will occur in June After an extended period of gloom Americans are starting to feel somewhat better about inflation and the economy a trend that could sustain consumer spending fuel economic growth and potentially affect voters decisions this fall A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan for example has jumped in the past two months by the most since There is growing optimism that the Fed is on track to deliver a rare soft landing keeping borrowing rates high enough to cool growth hiring and inflation yet not so much as to send the economy into a tailspin Inflation touched a fourdecade high in but has since edged steadily lower without the painful layoffs that most economists had thought would be necessary to slow the acceleration of prices The economy has repeatedly defied predictions that the Feds aggressive rate hikes would trigger a recession Far from collapsing last year the economy accelerated expanding up from in Our expectation is for a soft landing and it looks like things are moving that way said Beth Ann Bovino chief economist at US Bank Still Bovino expects the economy to slow somewhat this year as higher rates weaken borrowing and spending People are going to get squeezed she said At an appearance Thursday President Joe Biden pointed to the strength of the GDP report to tout his stewardship of the economy The experts from the time I got elected were insisting that a recession was just around the corner he said during a visit to the swing state of Wisconsin Every month theres gonna be a recession Well you know weve got really strong growth The economys outlook had looked far bleaker a year ago As recently as April an economic model published by the Conference Board a business group had pegged the likelihood of a US recession over the next months at close to Even as inflation in the United States has slowed significantly overall prices remain nearly above where they were before the pandemic erupted three years ago which has exasperated many Americans That fact will likely raise a pivotal question for the nations voters many of whom are still feeling the lingering financial and psychological effects of the worst bout of inflation in four decades Which will carry more weight in the presidential election The sharp drop in inflation or the fact that most prices are well above where they were three years ago The Fed began raising its benchmark rate in March in response to the resurgence in inflation that accompanied the economys recovery from the pandemic recession By the time its hikes ended in July last year the central bank had raised its influential rate from near zero to roughly the highest level since As the Feds rate hikes worked their way through the economy yearoveryear inflation slowed from in June the fastest rate in four decades to as of last month That marked a striking improvement but still leaves that inflation measure above the Feds target The progress so far has come at surprisingly little economic cost Employers have added a healthy jobs a month over the past year And unemployment has remained below for straight months the longest such streak since the s The once redhot job market has cooled somewhat easing pressure on companies to raise pay to keep or attract employees and then pass on their higher labor costs to their customers through price hikes Its happened in perhaps the least painful way Employers are generally posting fewer job openings rather than laying off workers That is partly because many companies are reluctant to risk losing workers after having been caught flatfooted when the economy roared back from the brief but brutal pandemic recession Businesses are getting rid of job openings but theyre holding onto workers Bovino said Another reason for the economys sturdiness is that consumers emerged from the pandemic in surprisingly good financial shape partly because tens of millions of households had received government stimulus checks As a result many consumers have managed to keep spending even in the face of rising prices and high interest rates Some economists have suggested that the economy will weaken in the coming months as pandemic savings are exhausted credit card use nears its limits and higher borrowing rates curtail spending Still the

before the recent solid holiday shopping season And buynowpaylater plans which let shoppers break up the cost of an item over time have spiked AP Writers Christopher Rugaber in Washington and Seung Min Kim in Superior Wisconsin contributed to this report,US economy grew at a surprisingly strong pace last quarter pointing to continued resilience The Associated Press WASHINGTON AP The nations economy grew at an unexpectedly brisk annual pace from October through December as Americans showed a continued willingness to spend freely despite high interest rates and price levels that have frustrated many households Thursdays report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product the economys total output of goods and services decelerated from its sizzling growth rate the previous quarter But the latest figures still reflected the surprising durability of the worlds largest economy which US voters are assessing ahead of the November elections The latest data marked the sixth straight quarter in which GDP has grown at an annual pace of or more Consumers who account for about of the total economy drove the growth Their spending expanded at a annual rate for items ranging from clothing furniture recreational vehicles and other goods to services like hotels and restaurant meals The GDP report also showed that despite the robust pace of growth in the OctoberDecember quarter inflationary measures continued to ease Consumer prices rose at a annual rate down from in the third quarter And excluding volatile food and energy prices socalled core inflation came in at a annual rate Those inflation numbers could reassure the Federal Reserves policymakers who have already signaled that they expect to cut their benchmark interest rate three times in reversing their policy of aggressively raising rates to fight inflation Some economists think the Fed could begin cutting rates as early as May Nathan Sheets global chief economist at Citi said that recent experience suggests that economic growth can remain solid even as inflation cools It underscores for the Fed that they dont have to be in a hurry to ease borrowing rates to aid the economy said Sheets who thinks the first rate cut will occur in June After an extended period of gloom Americans are starting to feel somewhat better about inflation and the economy a trend that could sustain consumer spending fuel economic growth and potentially affect voters decisions this fall A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan for example has jumped in the past two months by the most since There is growing optimism that the Fed is on track to deliver a rare soft landing keeping borrowing rates high enough to cool growth hiring and inflation yet not so much as to send the economy into a tailspin Inflation touched a fourdecade high in but has since edged steadily lower without the painful layoffs that most economists had thought would be necessary to slow the acceleration of prices The economy has repeatedly defied predictions that the Feds aggressive rate hikes would trigger a recession Far from collapsing last year the economy accelerated expanding up from in Our expectation is for a soft landing and it looks like things are moving that way said Beth Ann Bovino chief economist at US Bank Still Bovino expects the economy to slow somewhat this year as higher rates weaken borrowing and spending People are going to get squeezed she said At an appearance Thursday President Joe Biden pointed to the strength of the GDP report to tout his stewardship of the economy The experts from the time I got elected were insisting that a recession was just around the corner he said during a visit to the swing state of Wisconsin Every month theres gonna be a recession Well you know weve got really strong growth The economys outlook had looked far bleaker a year ago As recently as April an economic model published by the Conference Board a business group had pegged the likelihood of a US recession over the next months at close to Even as inflation in the United States has slowed significantly overall prices remain nearly above where they were before the pandemic erupted three years ago which has exasperated many Americans That fact will likely raise a pivotal question for the nations voters many of whom are still feeling the lingering financial and psychological effects of the worst bout of inflation in four decades Which will carry more weight in the presidential election The sharp drop in inflation or the fact that most prices are well above where they were three years ago The Fed began raising its benchmark rate in March in response to the resurgence in inflation that accompanied the economys recovery from the pandemic recession By the time its hikes ended in July last year the central bank had raised its influential rate from near zero to roughly the highest level since As the Feds rate hikes worked their way through the economy yearoveryear inflation slowed from in June the fastest rate in four decades to as of last month That marked a striking improvement but still leaves that inflation measure above the Feds target The progress so far has come at surprisingly little economic cost Employers have added a healthy jobs a month over the past year And unemployment has remained below for straight months the longest such streak since the s The once redhot job market has cooled somewhat easing pressure on companies to raise pay to keep or attract employees and then pass on their higher labor costs to their customers through price hikes Its happened in perhaps the least painful way Employers are generally posting fewer job openings rather than laying off workers That is partly because many companies are reluctant to risk losing workers after having been caught flatfooted when the economy roared back from the brief but brutal pandemic recession Businesses are getting rid of job openings but theyre holding onto workers Bovino said Another reason for the economys sturdiness is that consumers emerged from the pandemic in surprisingly good financial shape partly because tens of millions of households had received government stimulus checks As a result many consumers have managed to keep spending even in the face of rising prices and high interest rates Some economists have suggested that the economy will weaken in the coming months as pandemic savings are exhausted credit card use nears its limits and higher borrowing rates curtail spending Still the government reported last week

Alliance NCLA filed the suit Tuesday against the SEC claiming that the agency through its Consolidated Audit Trail or CAT program is collecting mass amounts of personally identifiable data by forcing brokers exchanges clearing agencies and alternative trading systems to capture and send detailed information on every investors trades in US markets to a centralized database The agency is doing so NCLA says without authorization from Congress and in violation of the Fourth Amendment which prohibits unreasonable government search and seizure of private information Conceived during the Obama administration with bipartisan support within the Commission the CAT program is a multibilliondollar selfappropriated fund powered by various fees the SEC has collected through investment transactions NCLA says The group calls it completely unlawful and says it puts Americans financial data at grave risk By seizing all financial data from all Americans who trade in the American exchanges SEC arrogates surveillance powers and appropriates billions of dollars without a shred of Congressional authority all while putting Americans savings and investments at grave and perpetual risk said Peggy

she said The SEC has illegally spied on American citizens who invest in the stock market REUTERS The lawsuit filed in the district court for the Western District of Texas calls CAT the greatest government mandated mass collection of personal financial data in United States history Historically a government that wished to track its citizens had to devote large resources to having them followed That is no longer the case modern surveillance tools enable mass tracking of individuals every movement every transaction every purchase sale or transfer of securities at low cost while powerful computer algorithms can process that information to reveal personal and private details of each persons financial life or investment strategy the lawsuit states This class action complaint

heres the dirty little truth all investing Americans will pay for this because its paid for by fees that the SROs selfregulatory organizations extract from the brokerage houses who charge their customers I mean this is a multibilliondollar tax on American investors and American investing and nobody ever voted for it A spokesperson for the SEC told Fox News Digital that the Commission undertakes its regulatory responsibilities consistent with its authorities REUTERS A spokesperson for the SEC told Fox News Digital that the Commission undertakes its regulatory responsibilities consistent with its authorities In an oped published Monday in The Wall Street Journal former Attorney General William Barr argued that even when the government seeks information about a citizen from

Exchange Commission SEC is illegally collecting data of every citizen who invests in the stock market according to a new lawsuit The New Civil Liberties Alliance NCLA filed the suit Tuesday against the SEC claiming that the agency through its Consolidated Audit Trail or CAT program is collecting mass amounts of personally identifiable data by forcing brokers exchanges clearing agencies and alternative trading systems to capture and send detailed information on every investors trades in US markets to a centralized database The agency is doing so NCLA says without authorization from Congress and in violation of the Fourth Amendment which prohibits unreasonable government search and seizure of private information Conceived during the Obama administration with bipartisan support within the Commission the CAT program is a multibilliondollar selfappropriated fund powered by various fees the SEC has collected through investment transactions NCLA says The group calls it completely unlawful and says it puts Americans financial data at grave risk By seizing all financial data from all Americans who trade in the American exchanges SEC arrogates surveillance powers and appropriates billions of dollars without a shred of Congressional authority all while putting Americans savings and investments at grave and perpetual risk said Peggy Little NCLA senior litigation counsel The Founders provided rocksolid protections in our Constitution to prevent just these autocratic and dangerous actions This CAT must be ripped out root and branch she said The SEC has illegally spied on American citizens who invest in the stock market REUTERS The lawsuit filed in the district court for the Western District of Texas calls CAT the greatest government mandated mass collection of personal financial data in United States history Historically a government that wished to track its citizens had to devote large resources to having them followed That is no longer the case modern surveillance tools enable mass tracking of individuals every movement every transaction every purchase sale or transfer of securities at low cost while powerful computer algorithms can process that information to reveal personal and private details of each persons financial life or investment strategy the lawsuit states This class action complaint challenges SECs shocking arrogation

investing Americans will pay for this because its paid for by fees that the SROs selfregulatory organizations extract from the brokerage houses who charge their customers I mean this is a multibilliondollar tax on American investors and American investing and nobody ever voted for it A spokesperson for the SEC told Fox News Digital that the Commission undertakes its regulatory

Motley Fool,stock market,The energy sector has been on an incredible run over the last few years ExxonMobil XOM reached an intraday alltime high of per share on April The oil major has pulled back a little since then but Exxon is still up big on the year and has more than doubled over the last three years Exxons market capitalization currently sits at billion as it approaches the feat of becoming the first halftrilliondollar energy stock Heres why Exxon is in favor with investors and why the rally has more room to run An emerging theme Up over year to date energy is currently the bestperforming sector in the SP And while you may think that tech stocks and the more growthoriented parts of the market are the leaders tech is actually lagging behind energy communications industrials and financials so far this year Given that energy makes up just of the SP its difficult for the sector to lead the market on its own But energy is part of the broader theme that earnings growth is driving the more valueoriented parts of the market Resilient to high interest rates Oil and gas prices fluctuate based on supply and demand Despite high inflation and rising interest rates over the last few years demand has been strong which has made oil a cause of inflation not a victim This characteristic is especially important since the Fed has yet to begin cutting rates and hot inflation data is leading some economists to expect fewer rate cuts in than initially projected Over the last few years Exxon has used its outsized gains to pay down debt which helped reduce its interest expense even as interest rates rose Exxon has been able to fund its operations capital expenditures dividends and buybacks from the gains of the business not by taking on debt or depleting the balance sheet of cash In sum Exxon has been resilient to higher interest rates because it has been paying down debt and not taking on new debt and because it doesnt depend on debt to run its business at least when oil prices are relatively high like they are today By comparison many companies investing heavily in renewable energy arent profitable right now due to an industrywide downturn The key takeaway here is that an oil and gas company like ExxonMobil is attractive to investors because it is raking in the cash enjoys impeccable financial health has a variety of ways it can reward investors and can do well even if interest rates stay high for longer than expected By comparison companies that are taking on debt or have high interest expenses are more vulnerable to interest rate risk The longterm levers Exxon is pulling are reinvesting in the business lowcarbon initiatives and making acquisitions In contrast the shorterterm levers are buybacks and dividends which have been substantial as Exxon has increased its dividend by and reduced its share count by over the last five years Exxons path to the halftrillion mark For Exxon it looks like its a matter of when not if it will hit a halftrillion market value Well learn more about Exxons results so far this year when it reports Q earnings on April The stage is set for Exxon to have another great year In its April shortterm energy outlook the Energy Information Administration said it forecasts Brent crude oil prices to average in including in the second half of this year This is a great setup for Exxon which needs to be able to justify increased spending as well as its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources a billion deal it expects to close in Q The simplest way for Exxons market value to go up is for earnings to grow With the balance sheet in good order Exxon can use outsized profits to improve the investment thesis whether thats with accelerated growth a higher dividend or more buybacks Exxons dividend yield is already attractive but it is a step below where the yield has been in recent years simply because Exxons stock price has outpaced the growth rate in its dividend Another factor to watch is Exxons investments in lowcarbon efforts It has been aggressively investing in carbon capture and storage including the completion of its billion acquisition of Denbury in November of last year Exxons rapidly growing Low Carbon Solutions business is a great way for the company to diversify its earnings and hedge against a gradual decline in oil demand and the energy transition However Exxon has made it clear it isnt just investing in low carbon for the favorable press it is doing so to make money In its Corporate Plan published last December Exxon said it expects to generate returns on lithium hydrogen biofuels and carbon capture and storage investments Exxon has several emissions reductions targets for as well as an ultimate goal of being netzero by Its a significant advantage to have the cash needed to take risks and invest in lowcarbon without jeopardizing the performance of the core business Exxon is a reliable choice Oil prices are notoriously hard to predict so if they come down for an unforeseen reason Exxons earnings will be under pressure which could weigh down the stock Regardless Exxon has the portfolio and fundamentals to create value for patient

financial markets pushing investors to look for safer places for their money The SP sank to close out its worst week since October when a huge rally on Wall Street began The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped points or and the Nasdaq composite fell from its record set the day before JPMorgan Chase was one of the heaviest weights on the market and sank despite reporting stronger profit for the first three months of the year than analysts expected The nations largest bank gave a forecast for a key source of income this year that fell below Wall Streets estimate calling for only modest growth The pressure is always on companies to produce fatter profits But its particularly acute now given worries that the other main lever that sets stock prices interest rates may not offer much lift in the near term A stream of reports this year has shown both inflation and the overall economy remain hotter than expected Thats forced traders to scale back forecasts for how many times the Federal Reserve may cut its main interest rate this year Traders are largely betting on just two cuts according to data from CME Group down from forecasts for at least six at the start of the year US stock indexes had already run to records in part on expectations for such cuts Without easier interest rates companies will need to produce bigger profits to justify their stock prices which critics say look too expensive by various measures This years jump in oil prices has further raised worries of more upward pressure on inflation Oil rose again Friday as tensions continue to roil the Middle East Israel has said it could strike Iran if it launched an attack from its territory following the killings of Iranian generals in a blast at the Iranian consulate in Syria Brent crude the international standard rose to settle at per barrel It briefly topped during the day and is roughly back to where it was in October At the same time Treasury yields in the bond market sank and the price of gold rose which is typical when investors are herding into investments seen as safer The yield on the year Treasury fell to from late Thursday Gold which has been setting records got close to touching per ounce for the first time before paring its gain Adding to the nervousness was a preliminary report suggesting sentiment among US consumers is sinking Its an important update because spending by US consumers is the main engine of the economy Perhaps more worrisome was that US consumers may be getting more pessimistic about inflation Their forecasts for inflation in the coming months hit the highest level since December Such expectations could ignite a selffulfilling prophecy where purchases meant to get ahead of higher prices only inflame inflation Thats why so much scrutiny is on corporate profits While the downside of a remarkably resilient US economy is a diminished chance of rate cuts the upside is that it should help prop up sales and earnings for businesses Thats helped growth in profits to broaden out to more kinds of companies rather than just the Big Tech behemoths that dominated the market last year according to David Lefkowitz head of US equities at

volumes Sweden stands out for having relative to its size thriving capital markets that are backed by legions of investors and which are even tempting foreign companies to list Sweden now has the deepest capital markets in Europe said William Wright cofounder of markets thinktank New Financial What theyve realised is you do need this ecosystem and you need to encourage it at every step of the way Policymakers across Europe are urgently trying to revive their own stock markets by changing listing rules and incentives for company founders and by trying to encourage pension fund and retail investment in domestic stocks Yet Sweden already has a sizeable head start on other countries having introduced many of these measures years or even decades ago Over the past years companies have listed in Sweden more than the total number of IPOs in France Germany the Netherlands and Spain combined according to Dealogic data The UK is top with listings While Swedens total IPO fundraising volumes are well below those in the US where some larger Swedish companies such as music service Spotify and drinks maker Oatly have listed the Nordic country has been highly successful at encouraging smaller domestic businesses to stay at home encouraged by the depth of its stock market Compared to the size of the country and also the size of the stock exchange the Swedish IPO market has definitely been more vibrant in allowing smaller companies to list than others said Tony Elofsson chief executive of Carnegie Group a Nordic bank and asset manager Around per cent of listings are valued at less than bn according to Adam Kostyl president of Nasdaq Stockholm A key driver has been the countrys investment culture which Carnegies Elofsson says has attracted everyone from the man on the street to very engaged private banking investors entrepreneurs but also the small and midcap investment community referring to institutional investors Among larger investors Swedish pension funds have long owned domestic equities The countrys four biggest retirement schemes have roughly maintained or increased their holdings of domestic equities in recent years In the UK in contrast domestic equity holdings among pension funds have plunged to about per cent Meanwhile Swedish insurance companies have the highest holdings of stocks in the EU Large investors typically take the role of socalled cornerstone investors in IPOs according to John Thiman partner at law firm White and Case in Stockholm giving confidence to businesses preparing to go public and to other investors Every single successful IPO has involved some level of cornerstone investors he said There is a very strong equity sentiment from rock solid investors Retail investors are also big buyers of Swedish stocks helped by a wealth of reforms in recent decades Compared with the rest of Europe Swedish households hold among the highest proportion of their investments in listed companies and among the lowest in bank deposit holdings while financial literacy is greater than in Germany France or Spain In the government introduced Allemansspar a product enabling ordinary Swedes to invest in stock markets By there were already mn of these accounts helping drive the launch of domestically focused small and midcap funds Such funds arrived to years before any other country did anything similar at least in Europe said Carl Rosenius head of equity capital markets at Swedish bank SEB Thats been the success story in Sweden for sure having large funds actively looking at domestic small and midcap opportunities Rule changes in the s allowed people to invest per cent of the amount they allocate to their pensions into funds of their choice supported by a public information campaign And in the state introduced investment savings accounts called ISKs that allow individuals to invest without needing to report their holdings or worry about capital gains or dividend tax Instead the total value of the account is taxed and in that was at a level of about per cent Some charities go into schools to educate those aged to about finance for instance on the difference between shares and mutual funds according to Joacim Olsson chief executive of Swedish shareholder group Aktiespararna Other European countries are racing to encourage their populations to invest in stocks The UK last month launched a taxfree allowance for investing in British companies while Frances finance minister frustrated with the pace of EU reforms has called for a few countries to forge ahead alone and create a new investment product Nasdaq Stockholm has even been trying to lure foreign businesses for instance small and mediumsized companies in Germany which Kostyl said is underserved in terms of the local IPO market Its clear that Germany has an infrastructure problem insofar that its very difficult for smaller companies to list there said Joakim Falkner partner at Baker McKenzie in Stockholm German investors have historically favoured bonds over stocks making equity raising more challenging Myles Murray founder of Irish medical equipment maker PMD Solutions chose to IPO in Stockholm earlier this year saying the plethora of comparable healthcare companies listed there meant analysts could more easily assess his company compared with listing on Euronext Dublin Access to large investors was a big help We were a foreign company pre profit and the smallest of brokers could get a meeting with the big pension funds and that was very surprising said Murray Swedens system appears to have translated into stock market returns Its main index has gained per cent over the past decade while the Euro Stoxx index has risen per cent and Londons FTSE just per cent That too is helping persuade

Finance,stock market,Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence AI are advancing so quickly its getting harder to imagine a world in which the technology isnt impacting just about every facet of daily life While much of the chatter surrounding AI has revolved around areas such as accelerated computing and healthcare theres another use case thats piqued my interest Integrating artificial intelligence into the corporate workforce represents a unique and compelling longterm opportunity Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has declared that AI software has the ability to significantly increase productivity in the workplace In a recent report Wood suggests that AI automation software could be a trillion market in Believe it or not there are a host of companies focusing on building more efficient workplace environments through the power of technology UiPath NYSE PATH is a leading player in AIpowered automation tools and I think it could be the best investment option in this pocket of the AI realm Lets break down how AI can redefine workplace dynamics and assess why UiPath is a compelling longterm opportunity Workplace productivity is ripe for disruption Bringing efficiencies to basic tasks is not a new idea In many cases technology has been the key to unlocking these gains In Ark Invests Big Ideas report Wood presents some interesting case studies related to robotics and how theyve enhanced completing mundane and administrative aspects of labor For example Wood says that the advent of the washing machine cut down the average time to do laundry by Similarly integrating assembly lines into factories significantly reduced the time needed to manufacture a car These ideas have been applied to the workplace for decades For example sales and marketing leaders have relied on customer relationship management CRM tools from the likes of Salesforce for many years Moreover enterprise resource planning ERP suites from SAP and Oracle have facilitated some of the largest businesses in the world when it comes to aggregating financials analyzing operating metrics and more According to Wood by automating tasks through artificial intelligence the average workers productivity could increase by x If all of the potential software vendors captured just of the productivity gain Wood posits these companies could reap trillion in combined revenue This scenario implies that UiPath has a greenfield opportunity as it relates to the intersection of AI and workplace productivity Lets dive into how the company is actually performing and how it stacks up against the competition Story continues Image source Getty Images UiPath is leading the charge UiPath operates in the robotic processing automation RPA market Essentially the companys software helps automate administrative tasks and boost workflow processes UiPath ended last year with over customers spending at least per year on its platform Moreover UiPath increased its customer count by year over year for those spending at least million per year on its software suite This highlights UiPaths deep penetration in both small and midsize enterprises SMEs as well as larger corporate accounts The accelerated customer adoption isnt entirely surprising given how much demand for AI has risen over the last year The company increased revenue by last year to billion Meanwhile adjusted free cash flow was million By comparison the company was essentially breakeven on a freecashflow basis during the prior year With an impressive partner ecosystem that includes SAP IBM Accenture PwC and Deloitte I think UiPaths growth story is just getting started A compelling valuation narrative The chart below benchmarks UiPath against a cohort of other enterprise software platforms that offer workplace productivity solutions With a pricetosales PS ratio of investors can see that UiPath is positioned right in the middle of this peer set PATH PS Ratio Chart What I find most interesting about the analysis above is that UiPath is valued more in line with the larger tech behemoths operating in the RPA space with Microsoft being the lone exception Given the success Microsoft has demonstrated through its CoPilot platform its not entirely surprising to see it trading at such a noticeable premium among this peer set Keep in mind that UiPath ended last year with about billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet Although the company is cashflowpositive one item to consider is how the company will allocate its resources In order to compete with big tech behemoths at scale UiPath will likely need to increase spending While that would impact the companys bottom line it could be a worthwhile strategy Im optimistic about the efficiencies that AI can bring to the workplace in the long run and am aligned with Woods theory that the market opportunity is enormous So far UiPath has proven that it can compete in the RPA market against larger and bettercapitalized enterprises Given how fast AI is impacting other important end markets I think itll be sooner rather than later that the technology will begin to make serious impacts on workplace environments I think now is a good time to consider scooping up shares in UiPath as productivity becomes more of a focal point for businesses of all sizes Should you invest in UiPath right now Before you buy stock in UiPath

two years Prices accelerated yearperyear in March the thirdstraight month inflation came in hotterthanexpected A smaller budget Higher debt could also lead to a poorer quality of life for Americans Zagorsky added Thats because the more the debt grows the more the government has to shell out in interest to service that debt and the less money the US has to spend on other priorities like Social Security and other crucial parts of the social safety net Advertisement The US spent billion last year on interest payments alone according to Treasury data Thats of what the government spent on transportation commerce and housing combined Pretty soon one of the most important things the federal governments going to be spending money on is not defense not on education It wont be on housing

children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren Our national debt is what the federal government owes its creditors governments institutions individuals that have lent it money When the government spends more than than it collects in revenue in a given year that is called a budget deficit For percent of federal expenditures required borrowing a deficit of trillion The accumulated sum resulting from years of borrowing to cover annual budget deficits is the national debt Our national debt has been growing rapidly In the debt was trillion and the annual interest payment was billion By the debt reached trillion on which billion interest needed to be paid As the national debt increases creditors will be paid an increasing amount in interest That will be a trillion dollars annually soon Projections for next years indicate that the national debt will increase by another trillion because spending will increase faster than revenue There are at least four reasons the annual deficit and national debt threaten our future First nobody is required to lend our government money If creditors lend us money at all they will do so only at a higher rate of interest With upward pressure on interest rates purchases like cars and home will be more expensive Second interest payments mean that other possible uses of federal funds are precluded For example funding to deal with another covidtype pandemic just wont be there out of collected tax revenue In fact existing social welfare programs andor national defense would be at risk Third money lent to our government is not available for private investments that tend to spur economic growth Fourth at some point there will be the risk of serious inflation Solutions wont be easy One possibility would be to cut expenditures Doing that would be politically difficult if not impossible Four major items account for of the budget Social Security Four health insurance programs Medicare Medicaid the Childrens Health Insurance Program and Affordable Care Act Defense Interest on the national debt Two other categories account for Economic security programs benefits for veterans and federal retirees Some of these expenditures are automatic entitlement programs Interest on the national debt must be paid to avoid the economic calamity of default Balancing the federal budget in would have required eliminating both Medicare billion and the federal share of Medicaid billion If you wanted to cut the Pentagon rather than Medicare you would need to cut national defense expenditures to zero Another possibility would be to increase revenue through increased taxation There is some discussion in Congress about raising Social Security taxes Income tax is a different matter Income taxes have actually been cut at least three times under recent Republican administrations and two of those were extended by Democratic administrations Our country has occasionally had commissions to address our fiscal problems The SimpsonBowles National Commission was created in by President Barack Obama It published proposals designed to set the nation on a sustainable fiscal path None of its recommendations were referred to Congress There is legislation in Congress now to establish a commission to identify policies to improve the US medium and longterm fiscal outlook As I understand it increasing income taxes is not included in its tasks An example of what would be included is stabilizing the debttoGDP ratio within a minimum of years GDP is the dollar value of the total economic activity in our country trillion in At present the national debt is of GDP It will be difficult to stabilize because our national debt is increasing faster than our economy is growing Dealing with the deficitnational debt problem will require both

Dimon, Larry Fink  Fortune","Mon, 01 Apr 2024 07:00:00

debt,National debt is fast becoming the thorn in the side of the American economy that nobody wants to extractand it will continue to cause damage sending the US into financial crisis and years of stagnation That is increasingly the opinion of a growing number of experts who are sounding the alarm over the pace at which the US government is gathering debt More important they fear this debt will mean the country will not be able to afford necessary borrowing in the future in addition to the funds needed to service existing debt Among the ranks of those in the concerned camp are Fed Chairman Jerome Powell JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Wharton vice dean Joao Gomes Their outlook is evidenced by a March report from the Congressional Budget Office CBO The CBO estimates that by public debt will represent of GDP reaching trillion Currently the nations trillion debt is approximately of GDP and according to the CBO will steadily increase over the next years In the near term the CBO expects debt as a percentage of GDP to exceed the record peak of the Second World War by This mounting debt the CBO writes would slow economic growth push up interest payments to foreign holders of US debt and pose significant risks to the fiscal and economic outlook it could also cause lawmakers to feel more constrained in their policy choices The report goes on to add that the likelihood of a financial crisis is increasing as a result of growing debt something which would cause interest rates to spike and if paired with higher inflation could erode confidence in the US dollar as the dominant international reserve currency The outlook from the US Government Accountability office GAO isnt much better A report released last month said the government is facing an unsustainable fiscal path that poses a serious threat to economic security and social issues if unaddressed The GAO advises Congress to make difficult budgetary and policy decisions to address the key drivers of federal debt and change the governments fiscal path adding The sooner actions are taken to change the longterm fiscal path the less drastic they will need to be As evidence of a fantastically complex fallout piles up one might assume it will take an equally complicated approach to prevent it Economists say thats not the casebut thats only if they believe its an issue at all The hardest problem is precisely that getting enough people to listen A sudden reckoning Whartons Gomes has been making his concerns about the level of national debt known for some time now and last weekfollowing an interview with Fortunehe sat before the US Senate Committee on the Budget and warned them of a train wreck ahead The vice dean of research at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School previously argued too few highprofile individuals were taking the matter seriously but as an upandcoming economist he felt compelled to step away from the pack to sound the alarm The coming fiscal crisis will be triggered by a sudden loss of confidence by the general public in the federal governments finances and on those tasked with managing them Gomes told chairman Sheldon Whitehouse and ranking member Chuck Grassley The projected path for the US federal debt makes this inevitable in the not too distant future Among the fallouts from the crisis professor Gomes foresees is a sharp decline in the value of the dollar as interest rates spiral higher He also believes inflation will spike as the government is forced to roll back on social programs to wrestle the deficit under control These measures would have a further devastating effect in the economy leading to a decadelong stagnation Gomes explained Given our projected demographic challenges many older and marginally attached workers are likely to leave the labor force never to return again Changing this future is not that difficult Professor Gomes outlines two wellknown options to rebalance the variables increase growth or cut spending The former is by far the most preferable Gomes said but it wouldnt accelerate quickly enough to do the job Even then the required fiscal correction is not drastic he added We certainly do not need to repay any part of the outstanding debt to prevent a crisis In fact government debt can continue to grow steadily over time without posing an immediate threat to the nations fiscal solvencyas long as the yearly deficits are not excessive A fiscal adjustment of around of GDPor billionspread over two or three years would nip the issue in the bud Gomes estimates However without a course correction a fiscal crisis is likely to occur in said Gomes or as early as if the next administration rolls out an expensive fiscal package that relies on implausibly rosy economic assumptions Regardless warns Gomes Its consequences will be severe and leave lastingprobably irreversiblescars on our economy and society Redoing the math Economists are increasingly revising the bill future generations will have to foot in order to pay for the fiscal outlays of governments way back when However that comes with a major caveat a global pandemic For example in the CBO projected US public debt by would be of GDP by Marchs estimate that figure stands at more than However the ratioand corresponding forecasted debt figuredoes fluctuate depending on whom you ask Even the CBO as recently as September projected the figure to be higherestimating an debttoGDP ratio by The GAO puts debt at of GDP by while the Penn Wharton Budget Model projects of the size of the economy by the same year Balance is not the goal Like Whartons Gomes Russell Price chief economist at financial services firm Ameriprise Financial is growing increasingly nervous about national debt while also fielding more questions on the topic from retail investors The expert at the Minneapolisbased companywhich has trillion in assets under managementadded the goal is not to balance the books from one year to the next Given the high deficits that were spending right now if we did that in a very short period of time it would cause more economic pain than it would displace Price also sought to unpack intergenerational criticism that high levels of spending now will unfairly burden workers of the future While Social Security as we know it only exists because of higher taxes paid by employees in the s Price outlined a great deal of spending will be needed in the future to support an aging population As a result younger workers have a vested interest in making sure whatever spending is agreed upon now is worth their investment in the future Price explained The one thing I point out to retail clients is the debt is never expected to be paid off in full but the burden of higher interest expense is where future generations are going to see the value in how much they paid on the promises that were enacted so many years before The other side of the debate Other more optimistic economists believe a crisis as a result of government debt isnt in the cards as fiscal stimulus should lead to higher productivity and hence to a rise in GDP Columbia University professor Brett House is a specialist in macroeconomics and international finance and falls into the cohort of experts who arent losing sleep over national debt House reasoned the recent runup in debt because of the pandemic is an example of how fiscal stimulus can lead to productivityafter all Q Q and Q all saw productivity increases of more than compared with the prior quarter according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics Indeed GDP growth in the US since the pandemic has outstripped every other G nationup in the latest quarter when compared with Q Meanwhile the G sits at with the EU struggling behind at Public debt is justified if it is invested in productivityenhancing measures that will ensure the economy generates growth thats required to finance that debt House told Fortune Clearly a lot depends on what happens in the wake of the November election he added On the current trajectory that were on right now I do not see a high probability of financial stress or substantial inflation in the US While House acknowledged that a debttoGDP ratio above would be dangerous for most countries he added The United States is not most countries It issues all of its debt in US dollars and consistently when we see the world in political or financial crisis money flows into US Treasuries and the bond market as a safe store of value Because the US issues all of its debt in US dollars it always has the possibility of finding additional buyers for its debt While economists disagree on how much of an issue national debt will be they do agree on one thing that the public needs to be involved People who represent labor people who represent average working people need to be deeply engaged in these conversations House said because the cuts will most likely fall on them,National debt Report finds US debt higher than thought after warnings from Jamie Dimon Larry Fink Fortune National debt is fast becoming the thorn in the side of the American economy that nobody wants to extractand it will continue to cause damage sending the US into financial crisis and years of stagnation That is increasingly the opinion of a growing number of experts who are sounding the alarm over the pace at which the US government is gathering debt More important they fear this debt will mean the country will not be able to afford necessary borrowing in the future in addition to the funds needed to service existing debt Among the ranks of those in the concerned camp are Fed Chairman Jerome Powell JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Wharton vice dean Joao Gomes Their outlook is evidenced by a March report from the Congressional Budget Office CBO The CBO estimates that by public debt will represent of GDP reaching trillion Currently the nations trillion debt is approximately of GDP and according to the CBO will steadily increase over the next years In the near term the CBO expects debt as a percentage of GDP to exceed the record peak of the Second World War by This mounting debt the CBO writes would slow economic growth push up interest payments to foreign holders of US debt and pose significant risks to the fiscal and economic outlook it could also cause lawmakers to feel more constrained in their policy choices The report goes on to add that the likelihood of a financial crisis is increasing as a result of growing debt something which would cause interest rates to spike and if paired with higher inflation could erode confidence in the US dollar as the dominant international reserve currency The outlook from the US Government Accountability office GAO isnt much better A report released last month said the government is facing an unsustainable fiscal path that poses a serious threat to economic security and social issues if unaddressed The GAO advises Congress to make difficult budgetary and policy decisions to address the key drivers of federal debt and change the governments fiscal path adding The sooner actions are taken to change the longterm fiscal path the less drastic they will need to be As evidence of a fantastically complex fallout piles up one might assume it will take an equally complicated approach to prevent it Economists say thats not the casebut thats only if they believe its an issue at all The hardest problem is precisely that getting enough people to listen A sudden reckoning Whartons Gomes has been making his concerns about the level of national debt known for some time now and last weekfollowing an interview with Fortunehe sat before the US Senate Committee on the Budget and warned them of a train wreck ahead The vice dean of research at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School previously argued too few highprofile individuals were taking the matter seriously but as an upandcoming economist he felt compelled to step away from the pack to sound the alarm The coming fiscal crisis will be triggered by a sudden loss of confidence by the general public in the federal governments finances and on those tasked with managing them Gomes told chairman Sheldon Whitehouse and ranking member Chuck Grassley The projected path for the US federal debt makes this inevitable in the not too distant future Among the fallouts from the crisis professor Gomes foresees is a sharp decline in the value of the dollar as interest rates spiral higher He also believes inflation will spike as the government is forced to roll back on social programs to wrestle the deficit under control These measures would have a further devastating effect in the economy leading to a decadelong stagnation Gomes explained Given our projected demographic challenges many older and marginally attached workers are likely to leave the labor force never to return again Changing this future is not that difficult Professor Gomes outlines two wellknown options to rebalance the variables increase growth or cut spending The former is by far the most preferable Gomes said but it wouldnt accelerate quickly enough to do the job Even then the required fiscal correction is not drastic he added We certainly do not need to repay any part of the outstanding debt to prevent a crisis In fact government debt can continue to grow steadily over time without posing an immediate threat to the nations fiscal solvencyas long as the yearly deficits are not excessive A fiscal adjustment of around of GDPor billionspread over two or three years would nip the issue in the bud Gomes estimates However without a course correction a fiscal crisis is likely to occur in said Gomes or as early as if the next administration rolls out an expensive fiscal package that relies on implausibly rosy economic assumptions Regardless warns Gomes Its consequences will be severe and leave lastingprobably irreversiblescars on our economy and society Redoing the math Economists are increasingly revising the bill future generations will have to foot in order to pay for the fiscal outlays of governments way back when However that comes with a major caveat a global pandemic For example in the CBO projected US public debt by would be of GDP by Marchs estimate that figure stands at more than However the ratioand corresponding forecasted debt figuredoes fluctuate depending on whom you ask Even the CBO as recently as September projected the figure to be higherestimating an debttoGDP ratio by The GAO puts debt at of GDP by while the Penn Wharton Budget Model projects of the size of the economy by the same year Balance is not the goal Like Whartons Gomes Russell Price chief economist at financial services firm Ameriprise Financial is growing increasingly nervous about national debt while also fielding more questions on the topic from retail investors The expert at the Minneapolisbased companywhich has trillion in assets under managementadded the goal is not to balance the books from one year to the next Given the high deficits that were spending right now if we did that in a very short period of time it would cause more economic pain than it would displace Price also sought to unpack intergenerational criticism that high levels of spending now will unfairly burden workers of the future While Social Security as we know it only exists because of higher taxes paid by employees in the s Price outlined a great deal of spending will be needed in the future to support an aging population As a result younger workers have a vested interest in making sure whatever spending is agreed upon now is worth their investment in the future Price explained The one thing I point out to retail clients is the debt is never expected to be paid off in full but the burden of higher interest expense is where future generations are going to see the value in how much they paid on the promises that were enacted so many years before The other side of the debate Other more optimistic economists believe a crisis as a result of government debt isnt in the cards as fiscal stimulus should lead to higher productivity and hence to a rise in GDP Columbia University professor Brett House is a specialist in macroeconomics and international finance and falls into the cohort of experts who arent losing sleep over national debt House reasoned the recent runup in debt because of the pandemic is an example of how fiscal stimulus can lead to productivityafter all Q Q and Q all saw productivity increases of more than compared with the prior quarter according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics Indeed GDP growth in the US since the pandemic has outstripped every other G nationup in the latest quarter when compared with Q Meanwhile the G sits at with the EU struggling behind at Public debt is justified if it is invested in productivityenhancing measures that will ensure the economy generates growth thats required to finance that debt House told Fortune Clearly a lot depends on what happens in the wake of the November election he added On the current trajectory that were on right now I do not see a high probability of financial stress or substantial inflation in the US While House acknowledged that a debttoGDP ratio above would be dangerous for most countries he added The United States is not most countries It issues all of its debt in US dollars and consistently when we see the world in political or financial crisis money flows into US Treasuries and the bond market as a safe store of value Because the US issues all of its debt in US dollars it always has the possibility of finding additional buyers for its debt While economists disagree on how much of an issue national debt will be they do agree on one thing that the public needs to be involved People who represent labor people who represent average working people need to be deeply engaged in these conversations House said because the cuts will most likely fall on them

measurements Debt Held by the Public Debt held by the public is the amount the US Treasury borrowed from outside lenders via financial markets to support government activities That debt is held by individuals businesses pension and mutual funds state and local governments and foreign entities It does not include intragovernmental debt which is used to track the cash flows of trust funds and other government accounts Many economists regard debt held by the public as the most meaningful measure of debt because it focuses on cash raised in financial markets to support government activities It is often expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product GDP a ratio that measures the economys capacity to support such borrowing Debt as a percentage of GDP is particularly useful in comparing debt levels over time and among countries of different sizes The United States debttoGDP ratio at the close of fiscal year was percent While this figure is down slightly from percent in a year high the nations fiscal outlook is still on an unsustainable path Debt held by the public is on track to exceed GDP in and climb to percent in In dollar terms debt held by the public at the end of was trillion Such debt is issued in a range of maturities from month bills to year bonds It also includes securities not traded in secondary markets such as savings bonds and state and local government securities At the end of September domestic creditors held percent of the outstanding debt held by the public Foreign creditors held the remaining percent The Federal Reserve typically accounts for a significant proportion of debt held by the public owned by domestic investors As of December for example the Fed owned more than percent of domestically held public debt However in response to the recent spike in inflation the Federal Reserve is decreasing the amount of Treasury securities they hold therefore the proportion of debt they own may drop Gross Federal Debt Gross federal debt equals debt held by the public explained above plus debt held by federal trust funds and other government accounts In fundamental terms it can be thought of as debt that the government owes to others plus debt that it owes to itself Gross federal debt stood at trillion at the end of September trillion of which represented securities held by government accounts Of that total trillion is held by Social Securitys OldAge and Survivors Insurance trust fund Securities held by such accounts represent internal transactions of the government and thus have no direct effect on credit markets Debt Subject to Limit The debt ceiling also known as the debt limit is the maximum amount of money that the US Treasury can borrow Increasing the debt ceiling allows the Treasury to borrow funds to pay for government obligations that have already been incurred due to laws and budgets approved by the President and Congress Debt subject to limit is almost an identical measure to gross federal debt The main difference between the two measures is that debt subject to limit excludes debt issued by agencies other than the Treasury and the Federal Financing Bank The debt ceiling has been suspended until January Conclusion Each measure of debt is useful in understanding our nations fiscal condition However no matter the measurement our debt is heading toward historic highs

pensions through entitlement reforms and other measures Revenue should keep up with spending over time In advanced economies targeting excessive profits as part of the corporate income tax system could further bolster revenues Emerging market and developing economies could raise their tax revenue potential by broadening tax bases improving the design of their tax systems and strengthening revenue administration Such measures could in ideal circumstances yield as much as an additional percent of GDP our research shows The foundations for sound and sustainable public finances require a mediumterm approach to budgetary planning and execution All countries can benefit from enhanced transparency of public finances and greater use of modern technology known as GovTech For countries in severe debt distress orderly and timely debt restructuring is important Continued international cooperation including through the Group of Twenty Common Framework and the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable is crucial to facilitate an efficient debt restructuring process This blog is based on Chapter of the April Fiscal Monitor

IMF Marcos Poplawski Ribeiro Deputy Division Chief Fiscal Affairs Department IMF Moderator Nicolas Mombrial Senior Communications Officer IMF Mr MOMBRIAL So good morning or good afternoon or maybe even good evening I think for some of you following us online I am Nico Mombrial with the IMFs Communications Department I am going to be your host today for this press briefing on the Spring Meetings Fiscal Monitor Fiscal Policy in the Great Election Year I am really happy today to welcome Vitor Gaspar the Director of the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department Welcome Vitor He is joined by Era DablaNorris the Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department Welcome Era And Marcos Poplawski Ribeiro the Deputy Division Chief in the division which has basically written the Fiscal Monitor Before taking your questions let me give the floor to Vitor so that he can tell you what is up for fiscal policy in this great election year Vitor the floor is yours Mr GASPAR Good morning everyone Welcome Thanks Nico It is a pleasure to see you all bright and early for our briefing on fiscal policy developments around the world based on the Fiscal Monitor Since the last Annual Meetings in Marrakech the global financial and economic outlook has improved Inflation has fallen Financial conditions have eased And risks to the global outlook are becoming balanced It is time to shift focus to fiscal policy Four years after an unprecedented pandemic response public debts and deficits remain elevated After sharp declines in and public debt and deficits edged up in undermining momentum for their return to prepandemic levels In fact only half of the worlds economies tightened fiscal policy last year down from percent in As a result global public debt edged up to percent of GDP in and remained percentage points above prepandemic levels Moderate fiscal tightening is expected to resume this year but significant uncertainty remains In a record number of countries with more than half of the worlds population are holding elections Evidence shows that in election years realized deficits are percentage points of GDP higher than budgeted Looking ahead global public debt is projected to approach percent of GDP by the end of the decade This rise in global public debt is primarily driven by China and the United States where public debt is now higher and is expected to grow faster than prepandemic projections Loose fiscal policy in the United States exerts upward pressure on global interest rates and the dollar It pushes up funding costs in the rest of the world thereby exacerbating existing fragilities and risks While modest fiscal tightening is projected over the medium term it will be insufficient to stabilize public debt in many countries Under current policies primary deficits will remain above debtstabilizing levels in in about a third of advanced and emerging market economies and almost a quarter of lowincome developing countries Higher real interest rates and lower mediumterm growth prospects add to debt pressures For lowincome developing countries scarring from the pandemic has been most significant and financing most scarce Against this backdrop our latest Fiscal Monitor calls for a durable and credible fiscal tightening to safeguard public finances The size of the necessary adjustment varies across countries The required fiscal effort is particularly large around percentage points of GDP for emerging markets with rising public debttoGDP ratios The pace of consolidation should be calibrated depending on the fiscal risks and macroeconomic conditions that each country faces Tackling debt and deficits today helps avoid more painful adjustments later It would also create budgetary space for priority spending and to deal with future shocks Fiscal tightening would also be important an important contributor to completing the last mile of disinflation especially in economies characterized by excess demand While strong public finances favor sustainable development in the absence of economic growth even sound public finances will eventually be undermined In the long run economic potential is mainly driven by productivity growth and productivity growth in turn is driven by the production and diffusion of innovation Fiscal policies have a role to play in directing innovation and ensuring that the overall gains are fairly and widely shared The Fiscal Monitor provides a novel modelbased framework to evaluate the case for targeting fiscal support to promote innovation in specific sectors The gains are largest when the sectors with the highest spillovers are targeted but missed targeting is a risk If support is generally to the wrong sectors policy gains can turn into sizable losses The chapter explores the risks of political capture Ultimately international cooperation is crucial for attaining the worlds innovation potential in addition to addressing multiple imminent challenges including global debt which is the theme of the next Fiscal Monitor and artificial intelligence on which we have a forthcoming staff discussion note I would like to conclude my remarks on climate change where international cooperation is essential and existential witnessed a continued increase in CO emissions It was also the hottest year on record with temperatures exceeding degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels Tackling climate change will require a comprehensive combination of policies at national and regional levels It includes fiscal instruments both taxation and spending Crucially emissions are a global externality and decisive global action is long overdue Leadership by major players including China India the United States the African Union and the European Union would be a gamechanger Thank you for your attention My colleagues and I are ready to answer the questions that you may have Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor I think most of you know the drill but let me just remind you of a couple of ground rules If you want to ask a question raise your hand A colleague will come and give you the microphone when I call on you When you take the floor please let us know which network you are from And for the colleagues who are joining us online please let my colleague know when you want to get the floor and I will try to alternate between the room and the people online I just want to start by one or two questions that I got in advance And then I will take more QUESTION Thank you Nico for taking my question So Vitor you are talking about the high public debt levels And the debttoGDP ratio is higher than prepandemic levels And you also mentioned higher interest rates Higher interest rates have pushed up the cost of debt servicing cost and are restraining fiscal space Can you elaborate a little about how big the pressure is for governments especially for lowerincome countries And also on China some argue that China will need more fiscal support to support economic growth but the IMF has also pointed out Chinas high debt levels Do you consider there is still fiscal space for the Chinese policymakers to boost its economy Thank you Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor I also had a question from the colleague from the second row which was very similar to Maoling QUESTION My question was also about rates We have seen that inflation here is a bit sticky It might push the Fed to reconsider first cuts rates this year perhaps a bit later It might be the same also in the ECB zone for the eurozone What might be the consequences for higher rates for emerging and developing countries and specifically those who are already in debt distress or near debt distress Thank you very much Mr GASPAR So thanks a lot Important question What we do see and we have in our baseline is that interest rates have increased relative to the recent past They have increased in order to fight inflation but longterm interest rates have increased as well And they have increased significantly more than what was projected prepandemic And that puts pressure on governments because spending increases given the higher interest bill At the same time we emphasize in the Fiscal Monitor that interest rates are volatile and they are much more volatile than growth rates It is very important when thinking about public financial management to take into account that the cost of funding the availability of funding may fluctuate in a way that can be sudden and unexpected in some cases When we look at the extreme case of lowincome developing countries what we do see is that these countries were not able to extend fiscal support in response to the pandemic crisis and the costofliving crisis to the extent that was possible in advanced economies for example PierreOlivier Gourinchas the chief economist at the IMF did stress that our estimates of scarring have been revised down for most country groups but unfortunately not for lowincome developing countries In the last six months in the period since Marrakech we have seen that sovereign bond spreads have generally trended down and we have seen a number of countries from subSaharan Africa issuing bonds in international markets in the early years But the constraints on public finance are particularly severe for this group of countries And the spending pressures to tackle issues like in many countries poverty hunger the need for infrastructure investment in people associated with strong growth of population and very young populations is clearly putting pressure and stressing public finances in these countries And interest rate high and volatile interest rates make the situation worse When looking at China we see that China together with the United States is extremely important for global public debt trends In the United States in our projections debt is increasing about percentage points of GDP per year In China the path of increase is even steeper So clearly issues that have to do with the long run sustainability of public debt in China are important In our view China does have policy space And China has a number of options that it can exercise to control deficits and debt But if I were to give you my three top challenges for China and China fiscal policy right now the tackling of the debt path would not be in the top three because it should be tackled in the context of a comprehensive strategy What is important in the comprehensive strategy One I would very much agree with the Chinese authorities when they put their emphasis on innovation and productivity growth That is a topic which is very central to the Analytical Chapter in the Fiscal Monitor The second priority that I would stress is the need for China to as quickly as possible solve the property crisis and the impact of the property crisis on the public finances of some subnational entities And third and also important China is facing lack of aggregate demand Deflation in China is a risk And by taking fiscal measures that support spending by householdsfor example by strengthening social safety netsChina will be able to sustain the adjustment to a new growth model at the same time that it contributes to macroeconomic stability right now Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor So I will take one more question from the room before going online I like to reward the good students who sit in the front so I will start with you please QUESTION Thank you very much for the opportunity So my question is regarding the US fiscal situation In todays report it has raised this concern about the US fiscal deficit in so with the general government fiscal deficit rising to percent of GDP from percent in despite strong growth And I also found outin yesterdays WEO report it also basically echoed todays report warned that the risk of shortterm risk to the disinflation process as well as the longterm effect and also the risks to the global economy since it risks pushing up the global funding costs Can you elaborate how the US fiscal risk can affect not only the US economy but also the spillover you know spillover effects to other economies Do you think that the US government should be you know more responsible when considering issuing more and more debts Thank you Mr MOMBRIAL Let me ask if anyone else has a question on the US OK The lady in the third row there QUESTION I wanted to ask the US President is going to announce today a call for increased subsidies on steel I know that youve raised concerns about that kind of measure in the past And I wonder if you could comment on that But then separately I wanted to ask about the issue of taxation You are calling for countries to do more to mobilize revenues And theres a growing you know movement to tax the superrich You talk a little bit about excess corporate profits but can you just talk about whether those options would produce sufficient revenue for especially developing countries Thank you Mr GASPAR Thanks for the questions on the US When it comes to fiscal policy in the US right now Id like to start the story with the very strong turning point in US fiscal policy in In the US was well on track to normalize fiscal policy after the pandemic And my favorite indicator of fiscal stancewhich is the cyclically adjusted primary deficitwas at percent of GDP that year In it was multiplied by almost three to reach percent of GDP And going forward the primary deficit in the United States will stay in the range of threepointsomething and only comes below three toward the end of our projection period That leads to a situation where debt is increasing at about percentage points of GDP per year We have emphasized many times that this fiscal policy puts pressure on policy rates It puts pressure on longterm rates It affects costs of funding everywhere in the world And if the stance of policy in the United States is also uncertain there is also an element of risk which is reflected in the pricing These phenomena are well documented in the Fiscal Monitor and the spillovers are quantified in a variety of ways Our view about the United States as about China is that the authorities have a number of options that they can use to put the situation under control And the way it will be done will be the outcome of the political process in the United States which is Eras cue to cover issues of trade and industrial policy Ms DABLANORRIS We are of the view that maintaining open trade is actually vital to the USs economic performance As you know Andrea in our Fiscal Monitor chapter we showed that even large countries large advanced economies tend to rely on innovation that is done elsewhere So we are of the view that this is important for the USs economic performance And as we have said before including in the most recent Article IV for the US we believe that the US should actively engage with all major trading partners to address the core issues that risk fragmenting the global international trading system And as the Managing Director herself mentioned in her curtain raiser speech we advocate for open trade and crossborder investment flows because this is important also for global productivity and for global growth The issue that you raised on taxation is a very topical issue There is a lot of concern about the fair distribution of the tax burden and there is particularly concern about the concentration of wealth and income at the top of the distribution In that context many times one hears calls for taxation targeting the superrich one sees calls for wealth taxation Our position at the Fund is that taxing the returns from wealth is generally less distorting and more equitable than a wealth tax Put in other words there is no objective in terms of fairness that you cannot serve given what we have now in the world better by adapting the income tax system We very much emphasize the importance of international cooperation For example in exchanging information to make tax avoidance and tax evasion harder we do believe that international agreements like what was possible in the OECD Inclusive Framework for corporate income taxation is a very important asset And we believe that countries and tax administrations should embrace the promise of technology to adapt the tax system and reinforce tax compliance Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you OK I will move online QUESTION I would like to ask you what are the main challenges for governments to normalize budgetary policy after the debt legacy of recent years Thank you QUESTION A couple of questions from me Here in South Africa the country will be going to the polls on the th of May one of the large number of countries that are holding elections this year But we struggle with perhaps challenges that are slightly different to others We are talking slow growth and we are talking very very stubborn inflation So I wanted to know from the Funds perspective what kind of advice you are suggesting that governments pursue with respect to fiscal policy to try to build the fiscal barriers that you say are necessary in this environment The second question is around the subSaharan Africa region We do have pockets of growth but there is a real risk of fiscal slippage across many countries in the region because of high debt We also have the elections that you were talking about and the attendant pressure to spend adds to that is the geopolitical fragmentation picture Are you seeing any evidence of this beginning to affect governments ability to implement effective fiscal policy And what kind of policy options are you giving to governments to prevent inaudible sliding on this Thank you Mr MOMBRIAL I had two people in the room also send me questions on subSaharan Africa I will try to bring them in because the answer may be similar Kemi so the lady in the fourth row there QUESTION My question relates to some of what theyve asked regarding taxation Youve talked a lot about mobilizing revenue in Africa in particular through taxation And this is something that has been very difficult for governments So in your assessment when you look at the region what are some of the tax and social policies that are working that will boost you know regarding the fiscal policy that you think governments can emulate and also improve upon Thank you QUESTION In your report indicated that fiscal policy should prioritize consistent with monetary policy to restore price and financial stability while supporting the most vulnerable If you look at what is happening in Africa especially in the countries like Ghana where we have a debt challenge some are calling for a review or a reform of the common debt framework In your assessmentwere going to elections including other African countrieswhat governments should do whilst this framework is delayed Which is also affecting government ability to mobilize funds and to restore macroeconomic stability What should they do to be able to ensure that we dont go through the slippages we do experience during an election period QUESTION Thank you I know you have been asked a couple of questions about Africa More broadly speaking how do youhow does the IMF assess the effectiveness of fiscal policies in addressing the unique economic challenges faced by various regions in Africa And what strategies are recommended to optimize fiscal policies impact across the continent Lastly in light of the evolving global economic dynamics and regional disparities what key adjustment and innovation does the IMF foresee in fiscal policy frameworks to foster sustainable growth stability and resilience in African economies over the coming decade Thank you Mr GASPAR Thank you so much So our main message in the Fiscal Monitor on fiscal policy is that time is right now to engage in fiscal normalization And that is because the world economy has proven very resilient Inflation is coming down Risks are now balanced And so almost everywhere its very important for authorities to stay the course to control public debt developments to moderate public finance risks and to build buffers to be able to withstand future shocks What are the obstacles I will leave politics asidebecause we got several questions specific for African countries So I guess that Marcos will be covering that specifically But I think its very important to remind everybody that one of the findings from a book Fiscal Politics from seven years ago was that countries that have strong fiscal frameworks that use fiscal rules that rely on institutions to ensure fiscal transparency have much smaller fiscal slippages in election years So with institutions it has been possible to control the temptation for incumbent governments to use fiscal policy for political gain And I believe that is extremely important Ms DABLANORRIS Maybe Ill turn to the question on South Africa first And in terms of sort of more concrete specific recommendations we believe more decisive efforts are needed to cut spending And this can be done by reducing transfers to stateowned enterprises rationalizing untargeted subsidies while protecting public investment and protecting well targeted social assistance for vulnerable populations South Africa has a good fiscal rule Complementing this with an additional target add for instance a debt ceiling could be useful Improving expenditure efficiency through improvements in procurement and public investment management would also help public finances In addition we believe that very ambitious structural reforms are really urgently needed at this stage to bolster growth The immediate priority for South Africa is to resolve the energy and logistics crisis And further reforms in product markets in labor markets and in governance could actually bolster productivity and improve growth prospects which will also be good for public finances Mr POPLAWSKI RIBEIRO Just to give you some numbers before going to policies in subSaharan Africa In fact subSaharan Africa this year in had like a decline in the overall fiscal deficit So the overall fiscal deficit in was percent of GDP compared to percent of GDP in It is projected to continue declining to percent in reaching percent of GDP by So that would bring debt levels in the region down from percent in to close to percent by the medium term in Now clearly there are risks to this baseline that we just mentioned and I think some of the risks we have already mentioned Some of the countries that have elections this year are allocated in subSaharan Africa And our chapter discusses the risks of fiscal slippages in countries with elections countries in an election year In terms of policies we advise countries in subSaharan Africa to increase their revenue potential So our chapter has a Box discussing the revenue potential Our department has launched a staff discussion note recently on how emerging markets and developing economies could raise revenue potential And the main instrument is through broadening the tax base We believe that broadening the tax base could be one way to increase revenues including in the region It is also important as mentioned in the questions to improve and modernize public financial management systems And by that the implementation of fiscal rules or credible mediumterm frameworks thats something that countries in the region could implement in the coming years to improve their conduction of fiscal policy The Fund is also contributing through capacity development The Fund is also contributing through IMF arrangements and through international cooperation on debt restructuring Now Ghana is one example of like how this fiscal consolidation is under way They have done a strong revenue mobilization in recent years and also control expenditure Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you I see that we only have minutes left so lets do Fiscal Monitor speed dating I see we have a UK corner there So let me take all the UK questions at the same time QUESTION The UK is one of the countries that has an election looming this year Is the Fund suggesting that fiscal policy in the UK should be loosened or tightened QUESTION You make reference in the Fiscal Monitor to the UK and the recent tax cuts in the UK the reduction in National Insurance Contribution It wasnt clear whether you actually approved of that or didnt approve of it And I just wondered what your thinking was QUESTION Thank you for taking my question My question is about finding balance between the fiscal tightening and climate change because as far as I understood the IMF recommends to predicts fiscal tightening measures So how would the IMF then recommend finding a balance between fiscal tightening measures and financing climate change including financing investing in green technologies also adaptation to climate change mitigating climate change and while maintaining the financial sustainability QUESTION I have a question regarding emerging economies And previously it was said that they will become a driver of future growth since the advanced economies grow at a slower pace But this sector is very broad And if we exclude China China has its own situation we have many countries Europe Asia all of them have different situations Is it possible to form some fiscal policy cornerstones for them in the future if its possible QUESTION In the Fiscal Monitor you mentioned Italy as one of the largest economies that are contributing to increasing the debt to close to percent by And I was wondering if you think that the government is too optimistic about its debt trajectory considering that your estimates are worse And as a followup question why have you chosen Italy in Figure as an example of a country that needs to do more on the fiscal front in the next couple of years And therefore what are your policy recommendations And what are these efforts in numbers Mr GASPAR The UK is a country that is characterized by relatively high debt The UK has had low growth for a number of years And the growth has been particularly lackluster in the recent past and the World Economic Outlook has revised the UK down Higher real interest rates and lower mediumterm growth prospects are common with other advanced economies And that is an issue that I have explored with my colleagues PierreOlivier Gourinchas and Tobias Adrian in a recent blog The UK authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation and they have been emphasizing since years the need to reduce inflation and stabilize debt To bring debt down to sustainable levels does require taking into account the criticality of spending on important and priority public services but also growth enhancing investments together with structural reforms to increase and improve potential growth There are a variety of measures that UK authorities can take to improve the fiscal balance both on the spending and on the revenue side I would respectfully recommend that the forthcoming Article IV consultation in May will provide an opportunity to discuss this and other issues more in depth and recommend the Regional Economic Outlook that takes place by the European Department this week Ms DABLANORRIS On your question on emerging market economies there is a divergence at this juncture in terms of growth performance as was pointed out in the World Economic Outlook but there are two points that I would like to make here The first is that while theres a divergence that we see at the current juncture from a longerterm perspective we see that productivity growth has been declining also for emerging market economies Right So as a group productivity growth has been declining structurally and this is a longstanding trend And the risk that this creates is that they can the convergence gap between emerging market economies and advanced economies wont close as easily So this gap could widen Right So what are the types of policies that are needed In terms of the Fiscal Monitor we talk about the importance of getting your fiscal house in order absolutely critical in order to be able to pay for the needed public investments in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in order to close convergence gaps There are a host of structural reforms that countries need which are country specific But in the Fiscal Monitor chapter we also talk about one very important component and that is innovation but specifically technology adoption So for most emerging market and developing countries technology diffusion or the adoption of innovation that is done elsewhere is absolutely critical in order to boost their own productivity growth and their longerterm growth prospects as well as to build their own innovative capabilities And here in the face of the ongoing digital and green transformations that we see there are a number of ingredients that we point out in the Fiscal Monitor For example if emerging market economies were to increase their spending on education by percentage point of GDP and this essentially closes the gap the average gap with advanced economies what this could do is that this would allow for a faster transfer of technology adoption and assimilation of technology from abroad And it could boost GDP by about percent over the medium term which is you know which is quite a sizable number And so this can be an important way for them to close sort of the skills gap in the digital domain We also talked about the importance of improving infrastructure quality Now to pay for these investments as my colleague has already pointed out countries will also need to look on the tax side of things And mobilizing revenues in an efficient way can allow countries to pay for these productive investments Mr GASPAR So to answer your question on Italy why did we pick Italy Italy is an advanced economy with a high public debt to GDP ratio It is a country where there has been traditionally a concern about bond market developments and spreads And perhaps I may have been even influenced by my own subjective experience because I remember joining European committees back in And at the time the high debt level in Italy was already an issue And for the record the public debt to GDP ratio in Italy increased quite significantly since In our forecasts we do have a situation where as in many other advanced economies the public debt to GDP ratio declined in Italy in and It continued declining until recently but in it is projected to reach about percent of GDP And going forward it is projected to continue rising to percent of GDP at the end of our projection period In recent years Italy has recorded a relatively strong recovery which together with the inflation surprise helped the decline in the public debt to GDP ratio that Ive referred to But going forward the dynamics are not favorable with economic growth projected to slow down and then recover but remaining lackluster at the same time that the effective cost of financing debt will go up There are spending pressures in Italy like in other countries associated with population aging for example but also the need for priority investments in green technology and digital and information technology And our policy recommendation to Italy is that it would be important to have a credible and frontloaded fiscal adjustment to put the public debt on a sustainable declining path Ms DABLANORRIS So maybe just very briefly on your question on climate In the October Fiscal Monitor we talked about a fundamental trilemma that countries face when it comes to tackling climate change If you were to rely on subsidies such as spending alone to tackle it it could be fiscally very costly and could add to debt pressures Not doing anything is not an option because that means global warming with really deleterious effects on lives livelihoods and economies At the same time if you were to use carbon pricing as a way to sort of meet climate commitments that could cross a political redline So somehow we need a package of measures that allows countries to get around this trilemma And we feel that carbon pricing should be an integral part of any policy mix because this could allow countries to raise the revenues that are needed for green investments but this should be complemented with a suite of other regulatory and other measures in order to incentivize firms and households to decarbonize QUESTION I would like you to comment on the news that the Brazilian government has weakened its fiscal target from a surplus to a balanced budget on the back of increasing fiscal spending and also postponing its objective to return to primary surpluses to QUESTION I have a couple of questions on Egypt particularly The first one is concerning the debt level As you know Egypt is currently engaging in a loan program with the IMF that has been recently expanded to billion from billion So my question is on the debt level in Egypt What are the projections of the IMF regarding the debt level in the country in the current fiscal year and the upcoming fiscal year And what are the recommendations of the Fund under the loan program to tackle the debt path as well as raise the potential of the countrys revenues My second one is on deficits We need to know the IMFs projections about the deficit and to what extent Egypt is able to achieve its target regarding its deficit until Thank you so much Mr MOMBRIAL So I would suggest that Era you answer first on Egypt and I will give it to Vitor on Brazil And Vitor if you could use that also to give any concluding words that you may want to Ms DABLANORRIS Doaa for your questions on Egypt So external debt in Egypt is projected to rise this fiscal year relative to the previous fiscal year And this is largely because of valuation adjustments arising from the exchange rate depreciation following the unification of the exchange rate But we expect external debt and overall debt to start declining from the next fiscal year onwards In terms of the fiscal deficits the budget for fiscal year targets a primary surplus of percent of GDP including percent of divestment proceeds to reduce public debt And for the approved budget increased the primary surplus target to percent of GDP Let me just say that more generally the economic strategy under the Fund program is really focused on reducing Egypts debt by putting the general government debt as a share of GDP on a downward path And this is expected to be achieved through continued fiscal discipline while ensuring adequate social protection spending for vulnerable groups and the use of divestment proceeds And more revenue mobilization will be also central to help support this effort as it will create the space that is needed for priority spending and for the targeted support that is needed for vulnerable groups Mr GASPAR After two years of cyclically adjusted primary surplus in and Brazil fiscal policy turned procyclical with a deficit of percent of GDP in Brazils public debt is projected to increase from around percent of GDP in to percent in the end of our projection period The authorities fiscal consolidation path aims for an improvement in the fiscal policy position over the medium term but uncertainty around fiscal consolidation going forward remains High debt and uncertain costs of financing call in Brazil like elsewhere for prudent fiscal policy and debt management Firmly placing Brazil on a public debt downward path would require more ambitious and sustained fiscal efforts Efforts should be anchored in an enhanced fiscal framework that builds on the new fiscal rule in Brazil while protecting social priority spending and investment spending I will now make my transition to the conclusion of this press conference with a number of key messages that I would like to highlight There are four messages The first you heard it at the beginning with the world economy resilient and risks to the outlook balanced the time is right for countries to stay the course of fiscal normalization build buffers to cope with future shocks and to bring down debt to more sustainable levels Two with the pandemic a distant memory and inflation approaching targets policies are no longer dominated by the response to common shocks and divergences across countries are taking center stage That means that policies in general fiscal policy in particular have to be adapted to country specific circumstances Third focusing on fiscal policy in this environment is appropriate because fiscal policy has an ample toolbox that is crucial for this adaptation to country specific circumstances I would like to emphasize the importance of longterm priorities like competitiveness growth productivity and I heard a lot about climate in this press brief Finally countries must embrace international cooperation to address the multiple and pressing global challenges And if you would indulge me if I were to pick one I would underline the urgency of climate action Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor Thank you Era and Marcos for being here with us Thank you all of you in the room and online,Transcript of Fiscal Monitor April Press Briefing International Monetary Fund Transcript of Fiscal Monitor April Press Briefing Speakers Vitor Gaspar Director Fiscal Affairs Department IMF Era Dabla Norris Deputy Director Fiscal Affairs Department IMF Marcos Poplawski Ribeiro Deputy Division Chief Fiscal Affairs Department IMF Moderator Nicolas Mombrial Senior Communications Officer IMF Mr MOMBRIAL So good morning or good afternoon or maybe even good evening I think for some of you following us online I am Nico Mombrial with the IMFs Communications Department I am going to be your host today for this press briefing on the Spring Meetings Fiscal Monitor Fiscal Policy in the Great Election Year I am really happy today to welcome Vitor Gaspar the Director of the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department Welcome Vitor He is joined by Era DablaNorris the Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department Welcome Era And Marcos Poplawski Ribeiro the Deputy Division Chief in the division which has basically written the Fiscal Monitor Before taking your questions let me give the floor to Vitor so that he can tell you what is up for fiscal policy in this great election year Vitor the floor is yours Mr GASPAR Good morning everyone Welcome Thanks Nico It is a pleasure to see you all bright and early for our briefing on fiscal policy developments around the world based on the Fiscal Monitor Since the last Annual Meetings in Marrakech the global financial and economic outlook has improved Inflation has fallen Financial conditions have eased And risks to the global outlook are becoming balanced It is time to shift focus to fiscal policy Four years after an unprecedented pandemic response public debts and deficits remain elevated After sharp declines in and public debt and deficits edged up in undermining momentum for their return to prepandemic levels In fact only half of the worlds economies tightened fiscal policy last year down from percent in As a result global public debt edged up to percent of GDP in and remained percentage points above prepandemic levels Moderate fiscal tightening is expected to resume this year but significant uncertainty remains In a record number of countries with more than half of the worlds population are holding elections Evidence shows that in election years realized deficits are percentage points of GDP higher than budgeted Looking ahead global public debt is projected to approach percent of GDP by the end of the decade This rise in global public debt is primarily driven by China and the United States where public debt is now higher and is expected to grow faster than prepandemic projections Loose fiscal policy in the United States exerts upward pressure on global interest rates and the dollar It pushes up funding costs in the rest of the world thereby exacerbating existing fragilities and risks While modest fiscal tightening is projected over the medium term it will be insufficient to stabilize public debt in many countries Under current policies primary deficits will remain above debtstabilizing levels in in about a third of advanced and emerging market economies and almost a quarter of lowincome developing countries Higher real interest rates and lower mediumterm growth prospects add to debt pressures For lowincome developing countries scarring from the pandemic has been most significant and financing most scarce Against this backdrop our latest Fiscal Monitor calls for a durable and credible fiscal tightening to safeguard public finances The size of the necessary adjustment varies across countries The required fiscal effort is particularly large around percentage points of GDP for emerging markets with rising public debttoGDP ratios The pace of consolidation should be calibrated depending on the fiscal risks and macroeconomic conditions that each country faces Tackling debt and deficits today helps avoid more painful adjustments later It would also create budgetary space for priority spending and to deal with future shocks Fiscal tightening would also be important an important contributor to completing the last mile of disinflation especially in economies characterized by excess demand While strong public finances favor sustainable development in the absence of economic growth even sound public finances will eventually be undermined In the long run economic potential is mainly driven by productivity growth and productivity growth in turn is driven by the production and diffusion of innovation Fiscal policies have a role to play in directing innovation and ensuring that the overall gains are fairly and widely shared The Fiscal Monitor provides a novel modelbased framework to evaluate the case for targeting fiscal support to promote innovation in specific sectors The gains are largest when the sectors with the highest spillovers are targeted but missed targeting is a risk If support is generally to the wrong sectors policy gains can turn into sizable losses The chapter explores the risks of political capture Ultimately international cooperation is crucial for attaining the worlds innovation potential in addition to addressing multiple imminent challenges including global debt which is the theme of the next Fiscal Monitor and artificial intelligence on which we have a forthcoming staff discussion note I would like to conclude my remarks on climate change where international cooperation is essential and existential witnessed a continued increase in CO emissions It was also the hottest year on record with temperatures exceeding degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels Tackling climate change will require a comprehensive combination of policies at national and regional levels It includes fiscal instruments both taxation and spending Crucially emissions are a global externality and decisive global action is long overdue Leadership by major players including China India the United States the African Union and the European Union would be a gamechanger Thank you for your attention My colleagues and I are ready to answer the questions that you may have Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor I think most of you know the drill but let me just remind you of a couple of ground rules If you want to ask a question raise your hand A colleague will come and give you the microphone when I call on you When you take the floor please let us know which network you are from And for the colleagues who are joining us online please let my colleague know when you want to get the floor and I will try to alternate between the room and the people online I just want to start by one or two questions that I got in advance And then I will take more QUESTION Thank you Nico for taking my question So Vitor you are talking about the high public debt levels And the debttoGDP ratio is higher than prepandemic levels And you also mentioned higher interest rates Higher interest rates have pushed up the cost of debt servicing cost and are restraining fiscal space Can you elaborate a little about how big the pressure is for governments especially for lowerincome countries And also on China some argue that China will need more fiscal support to support economic growth but the IMF has also pointed out Chinas high debt levels Do you consider there is still fiscal space for the Chinese policymakers to boost its economy Thank you Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor I also had a question from the colleague from the second row which was very similar to Maoling QUESTION My question was also about rates We have seen that inflation here is a bit sticky It might push the Fed to reconsider first cuts rates this year perhaps a bit later It might be the same also in the ECB zone for the eurozone What might be the consequences for higher rates for emerging and developing countries and specifically those who are already in debt distress or near debt distress Thank you very much Mr GASPAR So thanks a lot Important question What we do see and we have in our baseline is that interest rates have increased relative to the recent past They have increased in order to fight inflation but longterm interest rates have increased as well And they have increased significantly more than what was projected prepandemic And that puts pressure on governments because spending increases given the higher interest bill At the same time we emphasize in the Fiscal Monitor that interest rates are volatile and they are much more volatile than growth rates It is very important when thinking about public financial management to take into account that the cost of funding the availability of funding may fluctuate in a way that can be sudden and unexpected in some cases When we look at the extreme case of lowincome developing countries what we do see is that these countries were not able to extend fiscal support in response to the pandemic crisis and the costofliving crisis to the extent that was possible in advanced economies for example PierreOlivier Gourinchas the chief economist at the IMF did stress that our estimates of scarring have been revised down for most country groups but unfortunately not for lowincome developing countries In the last six months in the period since Marrakech we have seen that sovereign bond spreads have generally trended down and we have seen a number of countries from subSaharan Africa issuing bonds in international markets in the early years But the constraints on public finance are particularly severe for this group of countries And the spending pressures to tackle issues like in many countries poverty hunger the need for infrastructure investment in people associated with strong growth of population and very young populations is clearly putting pressure and stressing public finances in these countries And interest rate high and volatile interest rates make the situation worse When looking at China we see that China together with the United States is extremely important for global public debt trends In the United States in our projections debt is increasing about percentage points of GDP per year In China the path of increase is even steeper So clearly issues that have to do with the long run sustainability of public debt in China are important In our view China does have policy space And China has a number of options that it can exercise to control deficits and debt But if I were to give you my three top challenges for China and China fiscal policy right now the tackling of the debt path would not be in the top three because it should be tackled in the context of a comprehensive strategy What is important in the comprehensive strategy One I would very much agree with the Chinese authorities when they put their emphasis on innovation and productivity growth That is a topic which is very central to the Analytical Chapter in the Fiscal Monitor The second priority that I would stress is the need for China to as quickly as possible solve the property crisis and the impact of the property crisis on the public finances of some subnational entities And third and also important China is facing lack of aggregate demand Deflation in China is a risk And by taking fiscal measures that support spending by householdsfor example by strengthening social safety netsChina will be able to sustain the adjustment to a new growth model at the same time that it contributes to macroeconomic stability right now Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor So I will take one more question from the room before going online I like to reward the good students who sit in the front so I will start with you please QUESTION Thank you very much for the opportunity So my question is regarding the US fiscal situation In todays report it has raised this concern about the US fiscal deficit in so with the general government fiscal deficit rising to percent of GDP from percent in despite strong growth And I also found outin yesterdays WEO report it also basically echoed todays report warned that the risk of shortterm risk to the disinflation process as well as the longterm effect and also the risks to the global economy since it risks pushing up the global funding costs Can you elaborate how the US fiscal risk can affect not only the US economy but also the spillover you know spillover effects to other economies Do you think that the US government should be you know more responsible when considering issuing more and more debts Thank you Mr MOMBRIAL Let me ask if anyone else has a question on the US OK The lady in the third row there QUESTION I wanted to ask the US President is going to announce today a call for increased subsidies on steel I know that youve raised concerns about that kind of measure in the past And I wonder if you could comment on that But then separately I wanted to ask about the issue of taxation You are calling for countries to do more to mobilize revenues And theres a growing you know movement to tax the superrich You talk a little bit about excess corporate profits but can you just talk about whether those options would produce sufficient revenue for especially developing countries Thank you Mr GASPAR Thanks for the questions on the US When it comes to fiscal policy in the US right now Id like to start the story with the very strong turning point in US fiscal policy in In the US was well on track to normalize fiscal policy after the pandemic And my favorite indicator of fiscal stancewhich is the cyclically adjusted primary deficitwas at percent of GDP that year In it was multiplied by almost three to reach percent of GDP And going forward the primary deficit in the United States will stay in the range of threepointsomething and only comes below three toward the end of our projection period That leads to a situation where debt is increasing at about percentage points of GDP per year We have emphasized many times that this fiscal policy puts pressure on policy rates It puts pressure on longterm rates It affects costs of funding everywhere in the world And if the stance of policy in the United States is also uncertain there is also an element of risk which is reflected in the pricing These phenomena are well documented in the Fiscal Monitor and the spillovers are quantified in a variety of ways Our view about the United States as about China is that the authorities have a number of options that they can use to put the situation under control And the way it will be done will be the outcome of the political process in the United States which is Eras cue to cover issues of trade and industrial policy Ms DABLANORRIS We are of the view that maintaining open trade is actually vital to the USs economic performance As you know Andrea in our Fiscal Monitor chapter we showed that even large countries large advanced economies tend to rely on innovation that is done elsewhere So we are of the view that this is important for the USs economic performance And as we have said before including in the most recent Article IV for the US we believe that the US should actively engage with all major trading partners to address the core issues that risk fragmenting the global international trading system And as the Managing Director herself mentioned in her curtain raiser speech we advocate for open trade and crossborder investment flows because this is important also for global productivity and for global growth The issue that you raised on taxation is a very topical issue There is a lot of concern about the fair distribution of the tax burden and there is particularly concern about the concentration of wealth and income at the top of the distribution In that context many times one hears calls for taxation targeting the superrich one sees calls for wealth taxation Our position at the Fund is that taxing the returns from wealth is generally less distorting and more equitable than a wealth tax Put in other words there is no objective in terms of fairness that you cannot serve given what we have now in the world better by adapting the income tax system We very much emphasize the importance of international cooperation For example in exchanging information to make tax avoidance and tax evasion harder we do believe that international agreements like what was possible in the OECD Inclusive Framework for corporate income taxation is a very important asset And we believe that countries and tax administrations should embrace the promise of technology to adapt the tax system and reinforce tax compliance Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you OK I will move online QUESTION I would like to ask you what are the main challenges for governments to normalize budgetary policy after the debt legacy of recent years Thank you QUESTION A couple of questions from me Here in South Africa the country will be going to the polls on the th of May one of the large number of countries that are holding elections this year But we struggle with perhaps challenges that are slightly different to others We are talking slow growth and we are talking very very stubborn inflation So I wanted to know from the Funds perspective what kind of advice you are suggesting that governments pursue with respect to fiscal policy to try to build the fiscal barriers that you say are necessary in this environment The second question is around the subSaharan Africa region We do have pockets of growth but there is a real risk of fiscal slippage across many countries in the region because of high debt We also have the elections that you were talking about and the attendant pressure to spend adds to that is the geopolitical fragmentation picture Are you seeing any evidence of this beginning to affect governments ability to implement effective fiscal policy And what kind of policy options are you giving to governments to prevent inaudible sliding on this Thank you Mr MOMBRIAL I had two people in the room also send me questions on subSaharan Africa I will try to bring them in because the answer may be similar Kemi so the lady in the fourth row there QUESTION My question relates to some of what theyve asked regarding taxation Youve talked a lot about mobilizing revenue in Africa in particular through taxation And this is something that has been very difficult for governments So in your assessment when you look at the region what are some of the tax and social policies that are working that will boost you know regarding the fiscal policy that you think governments can emulate and also improve upon Thank you QUESTION In your report indicated that fiscal policy should prioritize consistent with monetary policy to restore price and financial stability while supporting the most vulnerable If you look at what is happening in Africa especially in the countries like Ghana where we have a debt challenge some are calling for a review or a reform of the common debt framework In your assessmentwere going to elections including other African countrieswhat governments should do whilst this framework is delayed Which is also affecting government ability to mobilize funds and to restore macroeconomic stability What should they do to be able to ensure that we dont go through the slippages we do experience during an election period QUESTION Thank you I know you have been asked a couple of questions about Africa More broadly speaking how do youhow does the IMF assess the effectiveness of fiscal policies in addressing the unique economic challenges faced by various regions in Africa And what strategies are recommended to optimize fiscal policies impact across the continent Lastly in light of the evolving global economic dynamics and regional disparities what key adjustment and innovation does the IMF foresee in fiscal policy frameworks to foster sustainable growth stability and resilience in African economies over the coming decade Thank you Mr GASPAR Thank you so much So our main message in the Fiscal Monitor on fiscal policy is that time is right now to engage in fiscal normalization And that is because the world economy has proven very resilient Inflation is coming down Risks are now balanced And so almost everywhere its very important for authorities to stay the course to control public debt developments to moderate public finance risks and to build buffers to be able to withstand future shocks What are the obstacles I will leave politics asidebecause we got several questions specific for African countries So I guess that Marcos will be covering that specifically But I think its very important to remind everybody that one of the findings from a book Fiscal Politics from seven years ago was that countries that have strong fiscal frameworks that use fiscal rules that rely on institutions to ensure fiscal transparency have much smaller fiscal slippages in election years So with institutions it has been possible to control the temptation for incumbent governments to use fiscal policy for political gain And I believe that is extremely important Ms DABLANORRIS Maybe Ill turn to the question on South Africa first And in terms of sort of more concrete specific recommendations we believe more decisive efforts are needed to cut spending And this can be done by reducing transfers to stateowned enterprises rationalizing untargeted subsidies while protecting public investment and protecting well targeted social assistance for vulnerable populations South Africa has a good fiscal rule Complementing this with an additional target add for instance a debt ceiling could be useful Improving expenditure efficiency through improvements in procurement and public investment management would also help public finances In addition we believe that very ambitious structural reforms are really urgently needed at this stage to bolster growth The immediate priority for South Africa is to resolve the energy and logistics crisis And further reforms in product markets in labor markets and in governance could actually bolster productivity and improve growth prospects which will also be good for public finances Mr POPLAWSKI RIBEIRO Just to give you some numbers before going to policies in subSaharan Africa In fact subSaharan Africa this year in had like a decline in the overall fiscal deficit So the overall fiscal deficit in was percent of GDP compared to percent of GDP in It is projected to continue declining to percent in reaching percent of GDP by So that would bring debt levels in the region down from percent in to close to percent by the medium term in Now clearly there are risks to this baseline that we just mentioned and I think some of the risks we have already mentioned Some of the countries that have elections this year are allocated in subSaharan Africa And our chapter discusses the risks of fiscal slippages in countries with elections countries in an election year In terms of policies we advise countries in subSaharan Africa to increase their revenue potential So our chapter has a Box discussing the revenue potential Our department has launched a staff discussion note recently on how emerging markets and developing economies could raise revenue potential And the main instrument is through broadening the tax base We believe that broadening the tax base could be one way to increase revenues including in the region It is also important as mentioned in the questions to improve and modernize public financial management systems And by that the implementation of fiscal rules or credible mediumterm frameworks thats something that countries in the region could implement in the coming years to improve their conduction of fiscal policy The Fund is also contributing through capacity development The Fund is also contributing through IMF arrangements and through international cooperation on debt restructuring Now Ghana is one example of like how this fiscal consolidation is under way They have done a strong revenue mobilization in recent years and also control expenditure Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you I see that we only have minutes left so lets do Fiscal Monitor speed dating I see we have a UK corner there So let me take all the UK questions at the same time QUESTION The UK is one of the countries that has an election looming this year Is the Fund suggesting that fiscal policy in the UK should be loosened or tightened QUESTION You make reference in the Fiscal Monitor to the UK and the recent tax cuts in the UK the reduction in National Insurance Contribution It wasnt clear whether you actually approved of that or didnt approve of it And I just wondered what your thinking was QUESTION Thank you for taking my question My question is about finding balance between the fiscal tightening and climate change because as far as I understood the IMF recommends to predicts fiscal tightening measures So how would the IMF then recommend finding a balance between fiscal tightening measures and financing climate change including financing investing in green technologies also adaptation to climate change mitigating climate change and while maintaining the financial sustainability QUESTION I have a question regarding emerging economies And previously it was said that they will become a driver of future growth since the advanced economies grow at a slower pace But this sector is very broad And if we exclude China China has its own situation we have many countries Europe Asia all of them have different situations Is it possible to form some fiscal policy cornerstones for them in the future if its possible QUESTION In the Fiscal Monitor you mentioned Italy as one of the largest economies that are contributing to increasing the debt to close to percent by And I was wondering if you think that the government is too optimistic about its debt trajectory considering that your estimates are worse And as a followup question why have you chosen Italy in Figure as an example of a country that needs to do more on the fiscal front in the next couple of years And therefore what are your policy recommendations And what are these efforts in numbers Mr GASPAR The UK is a country that is characterized by relatively high debt The UK has had low growth for a number of years And the growth has been particularly lackluster in the recent past and the World Economic Outlook has revised the UK down Higher real interest rates and lower mediumterm growth prospects are common with other advanced economies And that is an issue that I have explored with my colleagues PierreOlivier Gourinchas and Tobias Adrian in a recent blog The UK authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation and they have been emphasizing since years the need to reduce inflation and stabilize debt To bring debt down to sustainable levels does require taking into account the criticality of spending on important and priority public services but also growth enhancing investments together with structural reforms to increase and improve potential growth There are a variety of measures that UK authorities can take to improve the fiscal balance both on the spending and on the revenue side I would respectfully recommend that the forthcoming Article IV consultation in May will provide an opportunity to discuss this and other issues more in depth and recommend the Regional Economic Outlook that takes place by the European Department this week Ms DABLANORRIS On your question on emerging market economies there is a divergence at this juncture in terms of growth performance as was pointed out in the World Economic Outlook but there are two points that I would like to make here The first is that while theres a divergence that we see at the current juncture from a longerterm perspective we see that productivity growth has been declining also for emerging market economies Right So as a group productivity growth has been declining structurally and this is a longstanding trend And the risk that this creates is that they can the convergence gap between emerging market economies and advanced economies wont close as easily So this gap could widen Right So what are the types of policies that are needed In terms of the Fiscal Monitor we talk about the importance of getting your fiscal house in order absolutely critical in order to be able to pay for the needed public investments in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in order to close convergence gaps There are a host of structural reforms that countries need which are country specific But in the Fiscal Monitor chapter we also talk about one very important component and that is innovation but specifically technology adoption So for most emerging market and developing countries technology diffusion or the adoption of innovation that is done elsewhere is absolutely critical in order to boost their own productivity growth and their longerterm growth prospects as well as to build their own innovative capabilities And here in the face of the ongoing digital and green transformations that we see there are a number of ingredients that we point out in the Fiscal Monitor For example if emerging market economies were to increase their spending on education by percentage point of GDP and this essentially closes the gap the average gap with advanced economies what this could do is that this would allow for a faster transfer of technology adoption and assimilation of technology from abroad And it could boost GDP by about percent over the medium term which is you know which is quite a sizable number And so this can be an important way for them to close sort of the skills gap in the digital domain We also talked about the importance of improving infrastructure quality Now to pay for these investments as my colleague has already pointed out countries will also need to look on the tax side of things And mobilizing revenues in an efficient way can allow countries to pay for these productive investments Mr GASPAR So to answer your question on Italy why did we pick Italy Italy is an advanced economy with a high public debt to GDP ratio It is a country where there has been traditionally a concern about bond market developments and spreads And perhaps I may have been even influenced by my own subjective experience because I remember joining European committees back in And at the time the high debt level in Italy was already an issue And for the record the public debt to GDP ratio in Italy increased quite significantly since In our forecasts we do have a situation where as in many other advanced economies the public debt to GDP ratio declined in Italy in and It continued declining until recently but in it is projected to reach about percent of GDP And going forward it is projected to continue rising to percent of GDP at the end of our projection period In recent years Italy has recorded a relatively strong recovery which together with the inflation surprise helped the decline in the public debt to GDP ratio that Ive referred to But going forward the dynamics are not favorable with economic growth projected to slow down and then recover but remaining lackluster at the same time that the effective cost of financing debt will go up There are spending pressures in Italy like in other countries associated with population aging for example but also the need for priority investments in green technology and digital and information technology And our policy recommendation to Italy is that it would be important to have a credible and frontloaded fiscal adjustment to put the public debt on a sustainable declining path Ms DABLANORRIS So maybe just very briefly on your question on climate In the October Fiscal Monitor we talked about a fundamental trilemma that countries face when it comes to tackling climate change If you were to rely on subsidies such as spending alone to tackle it it could be fiscally very costly and could add to debt pressures Not doing anything is not an option because that means global warming with really deleterious effects on lives livelihoods and economies At the same time if you were to use carbon pricing as a way to sort of meet climate commitments that could cross a political redline So somehow we need a package of measures that allows countries to get around this trilemma And we feel that carbon pricing should be an integral part of any policy mix because this could allow countries to raise the revenues that are needed for green investments but this should be complemented with a suite of other regulatory and other measures in order to incentivize firms and households to decarbonize QUESTION I would like you to comment on the news that the Brazilian government has weakened its fiscal target from a surplus to a balanced budget on the back of increasing fiscal spending and also postponing its objective to return to primary surpluses to QUESTION I have a couple of questions on Egypt particularly The first one is concerning the debt level As you know Egypt is currently engaging in a loan program with the IMF that has been recently expanded to billion from billion So my question is on the debt level in Egypt What are the projections of the IMF regarding the debt level in the country in the current fiscal year and the upcoming fiscal year And what are the recommendations of the Fund under the loan program to tackle the debt path as well as raise the potential of the countrys revenues My second one is on deficits We need to know the IMFs projections about the deficit and to what extent Egypt is able to achieve its target regarding its deficit until Thank you so much Mr MOMBRIAL So I would suggest that Era you answer first on Egypt and I will give it to Vitor on Brazil And Vitor if you could use that also to give any concluding words that you may want to Ms DABLANORRIS Doaa for your questions on Egypt So external debt in Egypt is projected to rise this fiscal year relative to the previous fiscal year And this is largely because of valuation adjustments arising from the exchange rate depreciation following the unification of the exchange rate But we expect external debt and overall debt to start declining from the next fiscal year onwards In terms of the fiscal deficits the budget for fiscal year targets a primary surplus of percent of GDP including percent of divestment proceeds to reduce public debt And for the approved budget increased the primary surplus target to percent of GDP Let me just say that more generally the economic strategy under the Fund program is really focused on reducing Egypts debt by putting the general government debt as a share of GDP on a downward path And this is expected to be achieved through continued fiscal discipline while ensuring adequate social protection spending for vulnerable groups and the use of divestment proceeds And more revenue mobilization will be also central to help support this effort as it will create the space that is needed for priority spending and for the targeted support that is needed for vulnerable groups Mr GASPAR After two years of cyclically adjusted primary surplus in and Brazil fiscal policy turned procyclical with a deficit of percent of GDP in Brazils public debt is projected to increase from around percent of GDP in to percent in the end of our projection period The authorities fiscal consolidation path aims for an improvement in the fiscal policy position over the medium term but uncertainty around fiscal consolidation going forward remains High debt and uncertain costs of financing call in Brazil like elsewhere for prudent fiscal policy and debt management Firmly placing Brazil on a public debt downward path would require more ambitious and sustained fiscal efforts Efforts should be anchored in an enhanced fiscal framework that builds on the new fiscal rule in Brazil while protecting social priority spending and investment spending I will now make my transition to the conclusion of this press conference with a number of key messages that I would like to highlight There are four messages The first you heard it at the beginning with the world economy resilient and risks to the outlook balanced the time is right for countries to stay the course of fiscal normalization build buffers to cope with future shocks and to bring down debt to more sustainable levels Two with the pandemic a distant memory and inflation approaching targets policies are no longer dominated by the response to common shocks and divergences across countries are taking center stage That means that policies in general fiscal policy in particular have to be adapted to country specific circumstances Third focusing on fiscal policy in this environment is appropriate because fiscal policy has an ample toolbox that is crucial for this adaptation to country specific circumstances I would like to emphasize the importance of longterm priorities like competitiveness growth productivity and I heard a lot about climate in this press brief Finally countries must embrace international cooperation to address the multiple and pressing global challenges And if you would indulge me if I were to pick one I would underline the urgency of climate action Mr MOMBRIAL Thank you Vitor Thank you Era and Marcos for being here with us Thank you all of you in the room and online

The US government shattered its own quarterly debt record - Schiff Sovereign,The US government shattered its own quarterly debt record  Schiff Sovereign,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 15:29:59

Sovereign,national debt,Its barely six months into the US governments fiscal year which started on October and the federal budget deficit is already trillion This number is utterly astonishing Of course anyone paying attention to the rapidly dwindling US financial condition knows that the national debt is now hovering around trillion Thats up trillion in the last year alone and up nearly trillion over the last decade More importantly the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the US national debt will increase by another trillion over the next decade Those numbers are obviously bad Horrendous really But whats even worse is how much NEW debt the government actually needs to sell each year just to repay its OLD debt Remember whenever the government borrows money they issue bonds in various denominations these bonds can be as short as days all the way up to years Whenever these bonds mature the Treasury Department is obviously supposed to pay them back in full Of course the federal government doesnt actually have money to repay its debts So instead they issue new debt to pay back the old debt And the amount of money they have to raise just to repay old debts is staggering Last year alone the Treasury Department had to raise nearly trillion to repay maturing bonds Plus they borrowed an additional trillion in brand new debt on top of the trillion Unbelievable And so far in just the first three months of the Treasury Department has issued a record trillion in government bonds shattering the previous record for quarterly debt issuance that was set in during the pandemic Out of last quarters trillion debt issuance roughly billion of that was brand new debt meaning that a whopping trillion was borrowed to refinance existing debt To put that number in context the total combined value of all bank deposits in the United States is trillion So merely refinancing the federal debt that matured last quarter alone required the equivalent of of all US bank deposits Now in theory refinancing US government bonds shouldnt be such a big deal After all most bondholders typically just roll over their maturing bonds into new bonds And the majority of the maturing bonds are shortterm anyhow So its quite common that some money market fund which owns primarily day Treasury Bills will simply purchase more day Treasury Bills whenever their existing ones mature No big deal right Well the problem is that bond investors are rightfully getting spooked by outrageous federal deficits and theyre starting to demand a higher rate of return to compensate for the extra risk This is a major reason why interest rates have been rising government bonds have lost a lot of appeal and many investors no longer view them as the sacrosanct riskfree investments they once were Two years ago a day Tbill paid about Today its over Thats a X increase in the governments interest expense Another major trend is that bond investors have shifted towards the shorter duration maturities So instead of buying year notes and year bonds theyre buying day bills that have to be refinanced every three months This makes sense with so much risk and uncertainty few rational investors want to loan money to the federal government for three decades Shortterm bonds are a lot safer But this trend towards shortterm bonds means that the Treasury Department has to constantly be in the market refinancing record amounts of debt just like last quarters trillion It also means that the governments annual interest bill will continue to skyrocket because todays interest rates are so much higher than they were in the past Back in for example investors were buying year notes with a yield of less than Those year notes from are about to mature And for investors who are willing to roll over their funds and reinvest in say day Tbills the new yield is In other words the governments interest expense will increase more than x Remember that this years interest expense on the national debt is already set to exceed the national defense budget And if this trend continues the governments annual interest bill will surpass trillion over the next few years This is why we believe the Federal Reserve will ultimately step in and fix this problem by expanding the money supply and slashing interest rates The US government cannot afford to pay interest on the national debt Frankly they cant even afford to pay The Fed understands this reality and they know that the clock is ticking Thats why the Fed has been so vocal about cutting interest rates over the past few months even though inflation has been rising Minutes from the Feds meeting last month showed that they still anticipate cutting rates times this year And just yesterday the Fed Chairman said that while rates may stay at current levels longer than expected he all but ruled out any further interest rate increases despite rising inflation numbers As a final piece of evidence to support our view the Fed has already reduced its quantitative tightening program which is essentially the first step towards a new round of quantitative easing ie money printing As my partner Peter Schiff says the Fed has lost the inflation war But I would say theyre actually deserting the battlefield by abandoning their responsibility to keep inflation low The Fed believes that the insolvency of the US government is a far worse outcome than inflation ie inflation is the lesser of the two evils And it seems clear that theyre already positioning their monetary policy to bail out the federal government Bottom line this means more inflation But dont panic Its something you can prepare for and even benefit from More on that soon,The US government shattered its own quarterly debt record Schiff Sovereign Its barely six

expected to surpass the alltime high of percent of gross domestic product GDP by By the end of the year projection the debt is estimated to reach percent of GDP Such large and growing debt would have significant economic and financial consequences the CBO warns Among its other effects it would slow economic growth drive up interest payments to foreign holders of US debt heighten the risk of a fiscal crisis increase the likelihood of other adverse outcomes and make the nations fiscal position more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates Higher interest rates are already having a significant effect on the federal budget This year payments on the existing debt will total an estimated billion which is more than the Pentagons budget Debt payments have jumped by percent since thanks to higher interest rates and a larger pile of debt The new CBO report shows that debt payments will be one of the fastestgrowing parts of the budget for the foreseeable future along with the twin oldage entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare By interest payments will be the single largest line item in the federal budget If theres a sliver of good news to be found in the new CBO projections it is that the situation looks slightly less dire than it did last year That improvement is due to higher expected levels of immigration and stronger estimates of future economic growthnot because of anything that policy makers in Washington have done If anything they seem determined to prevent those improvements from coming to pass whether by limiting immigration or regulating the economy more strictly We should also keep in mind the usual caveats here The CBO does not account for the possibility of recessions natural disasters wars or other unpredictable events that could cause the federal government to borrow more heavily than current law expects The past years have included the war on terror the Great Recession and the COVID pandemic so it seems pretty likely that the next three decades will include at least a few emergencies that drive deficits higher There is no way to look at these eyepopping numbers without realizing we need to make a change

its founding principles conceived in liberty The particular values hes emphasizing more military spending to ensure Americas world leadership diversity equality and inclusion initiatives and perhaps unsurprisingly more growth for banks After securing the helm of JPMorgan Chase as CEO years ago Dimon has been adding national thought leader to the list of roles he dabbles in as a financial boss Hes had private talks on the economy with former presidential candidate Nikki Haley although whether he actually has political dreams is yet to be known In his letter Dimon took a stance on Americas position as a global leader right off the bat The terrible ongoing war and violence in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as growing geopolitical tensions importantly in China he wrote are challenging Americas global leadership role which he said is further undermined by the USs political polarization While he noted the countrys economy continues to be resilient marked by consumers still spending the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus But as unwelcome as that spending is he wrote it will need to increase as global supply chains are restructured as seen in the drop in oil production after Russias invasion of Ukraine and as the country transitions to a greener economy Despite his earlier criticism of government spendinghe has called the debt a cliff and warned of a stock market rebellion over government debtDimon identified one key area he says needs a boost military expenditures The ongoing wars have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets migration and military and economic relationships in addition to their dreadful human cost he wrote The fallout from these wars he wrote should also lay to rest the idea that America can stand alone adding that global peace and order are vital to American interests To that effect Dimon said America needs to lead with one of its biggest strengths military spending And that spending is copious This year the US approved about billion in funding for national defense according to a Senate Armed Services Committee report up from about billion in the budget The US is the worlds largest military spender representing about of the worlds military spending despite having just of its population It spent more on national defense than the next nine countries combined most of which including the UK Germany and France are politically aligned with the US But the Pentagons budget only accounts for about onethird of the USs total warrelated spending according to a Brown University report on the costs of war Between and USfunded combat in post war zones in Syria Iraq Libya Yemen and Ukraine has accumulated trillion in costs when considering additional Homeland Security spending interest on debt and veterans health care And to Dimons earlier point the current wars have been paid for almost entirely with borrowed money on which interest has to be paid while in the past wars were paid for by raising taxes and selling war bonds Between and the US paid over trillion in interest on wars according to the Brown report The shift in military funding started during George W Bushs presidency when he slashed federal taxes just as the country invaded Afghanistan and Iraq in according to Just Security an online forum that analyzes security and foreign policy Barack Obama made most of those cuts permanent while overseeing expanded US military activity in Syria and Donald Trump implemented another round of massive tax cuts in as the US was doubling down on its war in Afghanistan dropping its most powerful nonnuclear bomb in the countrys Nangarhar Province Federal taxes dropped from about of gross domestic product in to about by the start of Usually Just Security writes wars are funded through higher taxes and war bonds after an initial emergency funding period of one to two years Yet for the entire decade between and conflicts in the Middle East were paid for from emergency budgets which are devoid of serious legislative or executive oversight Progressive politicians have long called for less military spending urging lawmakers to reallocate some military funds to other industries that need support like health care and education And lately theyve been meeting a rare point of agreement with some Republicans who were outraged over a trillion funding bill for aid to Ukraine that Biden passed in December the Guardian reported Debt aside Americas military spending does however help the country secure its spot as a world leader The countrys hundreds of overseas military bases combined with the worlds largest economy and leadership positions in various international institutions like the United Nations make it an undeniable global power according to a report from the Council on Foreign Relations The downsides to high military spending include concerns that such spending is economically unsustainable is wasteful and wreaks environmental havocmilitaries are responsible for about of global greenhouse gas emissions according to a Conflict and Environment Observatory report Beyond that the military bases allow the US to hold military presences in countries including Cuba the Philippines Spain Germany and South Koreamany of which especially in Europe have negative perceptions about that presence according to a federal government study China is the worlds secondlargest military spender allocating billion for its national defense in up from the year beforebut its still just a fraction of the US budget In his letter Dimon also offers his takes on other big issues in the country including doubling down on DEI initiatives He highlighted his companys Advancing Black Pathways program stating its focus on strengthening the economic foundation of Black communities because we know that opportunity is not always created equally This comes as farright politicians continue churning out initiatives aimed at dismantling diversity programs At least bills that limit DEI programs in higher education were introduced in states in and eight of them became law The passed bills include limitations like censoring classroom instructions on racism and sexism banning books about people of color and those who are queer and closing DEI offices in universities In a world becoming increasingly more complex with these issues Dimon reiterated that there is growing interconnectedness between foreign economic policy national security and investment The US needs to lead with its strengthsnot only its military but also its economic diplomatic and moral forces he wrote There is nothing more important,Jamie Dimon who said the trillion national debt was pushing US off a cliff insists its vital to

wasteful and wreaks environmental havocmilitaries are responsible for about of global greenhouse gas emissions according to a Conflict and Environment Observatory report Beyond that the military bases allow the US to hold military presences in countries including Cuba the Philippines Spain Germany and South Koreamany of which especially in Europe have negative perceptions about that presence according to a federal government study China is the worlds secondlargest military spender allocating billion for its national defense in up from the year beforebut its still just a fraction of the US budget In his letter Dimon also offers his takes on other big issues in the country including doubling down on DEI initiatives He highlighted his companys Advancing Black Pathways program stating its focus on strengthening the economic foundation of Black communities because we know that opportunity is not always created equally This comes as farright politicians continue churning out initiatives aimed at dismantling diversity programs At least bills that limit DEI programs in higher education were introduced in states in and eight of them became law The passed bills include limitations like censoring classroom instructions on racism and sexism banning books about people of color and those who are queer and closing DEI offices in universities In a world becoming increasingly more complex with these issues Dimon reiterated that there is growing interconnectedness between foreign economic policy national security and investment The US needs to lead with its strengthsnot only its

is almost the same size as the entire US economy and the debt is on track to double within the next thirty years Some economists say that could expose the country to a number of dangers including a

expensive wars in Korea and Vietnam and the establishment of major entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid Overall debt as a percentage of GDP bottomed out in at percent In the s the Ronald Reagan administration vastly increased defense spending and enacted sweeping tax cuts ushering in a new period of rising debt During the s a combination of tax increases defense cuts and an economic boom reduced the debt as a percentage of GDP In President Bill Clinton and a Republicancontrolled Congress oversaw the first of four consecutive years of budget surplusesthe first such streak in forty years Deficits returned under President George W Bush who led a period of tax cuts war spending in Afghanistan and Iraq and major new entitlements such as Medicare Part D which added prescription drug coverage to the program Annual deficits hit record levelsmore than trillionunder President Barack Obama who in response to the Great Recession continued the Bush administrations bank bailout program and provided hundreds of billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus What does the government spend money on The federal budget is divided between mandatory and discretionary spending and interest payments on the debt Most of the budget goes toward mandatory spending which is automatic unless Congress alters the legislation authorizing it This spending primarily consists of entitlement programs such as Social Security Medicare and Medicaid The remainder goes toward discretionary spending which Congress must authorize each year through the appropriations process and debt service In fiscal year only percent of federal spending went toward discretionary programs with the heaviest spending about billion going to defenserelated agencies and programs Other major discretionary outlays including health education veterans benefits and transportation each made up less than billion What are the primary drivers of debt growth On the spending side of the ledger the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office CBO projects the main drivers to be mandatory spending programs namely Social Securitythe largest US government programMedicare and Medicaid These CBO projections assume that the laws underlying federal revenue and spending remain unchanged Their costs are expected to rise as a percentage of GDP as the US population ages and health expenses climb without any corresponding increase in revenue In the immediate future interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase dramatically in relation to GDP They have recently risen to their highest levels in more than twenty years as the Federal Reserve raised rates to combat inflation sparked by the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine In fiscal year net interest payments on the national debt reached billionabout percent of GDPand they are projected to surge to nearly percent over the next thirty years On the other hand discretionary spendingincluding for example spending on defense and transportationis expected to remain constant as a share of GDP The steady growth in federal spending in the coming decades is expected to occur while government tax revenue remains low relative to the size of the economy In President Donald Trump signed off on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the most significant tax legislation in a generation Trump and some Republican lawmakers said the bills tax cuts would boost economic growth enough to increase government revenues and balance the budget but many economists disagreed The CBO said the law would actually increase annual budget shortfalls and add another roughly trillion to the debt over the next ten years Tax cuts will add another roughly trillion to the debt over the next ten years The national debt swelled during the COVID pandemic as the government spent trillions of dollars to boost the flagging economy including on stimulus checks for citizens and aid for businesses and state and local governments These measures increased the federal deficit to trillion in about percent of GDPthe highest level since World War II President Joe Biden has signed into law several initiatives that are projected to increase the debt including an infrastructure bill the CBO projected will increase the federal deficit by more than billion over the next decade and landmark climate legislation that independent experts say will add billion to the deficit over the next decade CBO and independent models initially projected that legislation would reduce the deficit by almost billion Biden has also forgiven billion in student loans though a wider forgiveness plan was rejected by the Supreme Court Meanwhile US foreignassistance spending reached a seventyyear high in as the United States provided Ukraine tens of billions in aid to fight off Russias invasion though it remains less than percent of total government spending As of September the deficit measured as a proportion of GDP was larger than in any fiscal year in which the United States did not face war recession or another emergency How does US debt compare to that of other countries The pandemic sharply increased borrowing around the world according to the International Monetary Fund Among advanced economies debt as a percentage of GDP increased from around percent to more than percent As of the United States debttoGDP ratio is among the highest in the developed world behind only Japan and Italy However the United States has long been the worlds largest economy with no record of defaulting on its debt Moreover the US dollar has been the worlds reserve currency since the s High domestic and international demand for the dollar has helped the United States finance its debt This is because many investors including central banks around the world hold dollardenominated assets such as US Treasury bills notes and bonds due to their relative safety low risk the unparalleled size of the US debt market and more recently the opportunity to generate a higher yield than on safe euro or yendenominated securities These Treasurys are the primary financial instruments that the US government issues to finance its spending Who holds the debt The bulk of US debt is held by investors who buy Treasury securities at varying maturities and interest rates They include domestic and foreign investors as well as both governmental and private funds Foreign investors mostly governments hold more than percent of the total Japan holds the most with more than trillion China which was the United States largest creditor for much of the last decade holds the next most though its reported holdings have fallen in recent years Apart from China Japan and the United Kingdom no other country holds more than billion An increasing share of foreign holdings now comes from governments with large financialservices industries including Belgium Ireland Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands How much does rising US debt matter The sheer volume of accumulating deficits alongside a longrunning lack of political will to raise revenue or cut spending has renewed debate over the peril posed by the national debt Some economists fear that continued growth of the national debt could undermine US global leadership by leaving fewer dollars for US military diplomatic and humanitarian operations around the world Other experts worry that large debts could become a drag on the economy or precipitate a fiscal crisis arguing that there is a tipping point beyond which large accumulations of government debt begin to slow growth Under this scenario investors could lose confidence in Washingtons ability to right its fiscal ship and become unwilling to finance US borrowing without much higher interest rates This would result in even larger borrowing costs or what is sometimes called a debt spiral A fiscal crisis of this nature could necessitate sudden and economically painful spending cuts or tax increases What is the debt ceiling The debt ceiling is the congressionally mandated limit on how much the Treasury Department can borrow including to pay debts the United States already owes Since it was established during World War I the debt ceiling has been raised dozens of times Some experts say that servicing the debt could divert investment from vital areas such as infrastructure education and the fight against climate change In recent years this onceroutine act has become a highly partisan game of brinkmanship that has brought the United States near default on several occasions Experts such as CFRs Brad W Setser argue that the United States has both domestic and international incentives to scrap the debt ceiling which they view as an unnecessary risk The only other advanced economy to have one is Denmark and it has never come close to reaching its ceiling What are the policy options for dealing with the debt Politicians and policy experts have put forward countless plans over the years to balance the federal budget and reduce the debt Most include a combination of deep spending cuts and tax increases to bend the debt curve Cutting spending Most comprehensive proposals to rein in the debt include major cuts to spending on entitlement programs and defense For instance the SimpsonBowles plan a major bipartisan deficitreduction plan that failed to win support in Congress would have put debt on a downward path and reduced overall spending including for the military It also would have reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments and put Social Security on sustainable footing by reducing some benefits and raising the retirement age Economists including CFRs Benn Steil have called on Congress to create a new bipartisan commission similar to the SimpsonBowles model Raising revenue Most budget reform plans also seek to raise tax revenue whether by eliminating deductions and other tax subsidies raising rates on higher earners and corporations or introducing new taxes such as a carbon tax SimpsonBowles would have raised more than trillion in new tax revenue However more than percent of Republicans in Congress have signed a pledge never to raise taxes limiting lawmakers ability to find compromise on revenue generation Some optimists believe that the federal government could continue expanding the debt many years into the future with few consequences thanks to the reservoirs of trust the US economy has accumulated in the eyes of investors But many experts say this is simply too risky and that time is running out to get the debt under control Economists at the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate that financial markets cannot sustain more than twenty additional years of deficits At that point they argue no amount of tax increases or spending cuts would suffice to avert a devastating default The

College of Liberal Arts,national debt,Abstract National debt in the United States has the potential to impact every citizen and resident of the nation because of the cascading nature of the financial impact on nearly all aspects of everyday life This could be from increased taxes on a federal level to downstream impacts on programs provided by the government like social security National debt accumulates when the government spends more than it has in tax revenue and takes on loans at the federal level These loans have interest which increases the amount of money owed by the government The more money owed through loans the more interest and the further in the red the nation becomes financially A somewhat partisan political issue the national debt is frequently in the news cycle especially in periods when the national debt ceiling or maximum debt allowed is reached or close to being reached Some of this debt is held internallymeaning by entities within the United States such as the Social Security Administration or other governmental organizations Foreign or external debt on the other hand is debt held by an entity like a nation that is outside the United States Debts held internally by the Treasury or other domestic institutions have significantly different impacts than debts held externally largely because of varying interest rates dictated by the nation or entity holding the debt Through a capstonelevel political science course International Political Economy I was able to research the impacts of externally versus internally held debt on the United States overall indebtedness I used the time period of approximately as a case study The cost of debt was amplified during this time because of the recovery from the recession the effects of which the government aimed to mitigate through additional stimulus spending Using this period as a case study illustrates a time when the United States was heavily reliant on external foreign debts and was spending more than it was taking in leading to significant financial deficits for the nation ECLAC The total US debt rose by about trillion during the period of almost doubling the national debt held in Fiscal Data Explains the National Debt Research Methods I began my research by analyzing the types of national debt held by the United States and its impact on US society I completed a comprehensive analysis using both qualitative and quantitative data largely through a literature review of a variety of sources including US Treasury and government files scholarly journals and think tank reports I also identified trends of US debt and changes in how other nations perceived US foreign debt over time A major part of the national debt structure for the United States during the time period of my case study was the impact of highinterest foreign debts which are held in the form of securities and used to allow for governmental discretionary spending Many such debts were acquired during the postWorld War II era also known as the Bretton Woods era from to During this time the United States was lending money to rebuilding and developing nations through the Bretton Woods accords with the purpose of establishing the US dollar as an international currency This was achieved through the exchanging of other nations gold into US dollars at a fixed rate This lending was structured to help foster relations between the United States and other countries but put the United States at risk as it took on debt While gold is a tangible asset the process of exchange meant there was a negative impact on the US debt The willingness to trade dollars for gold led to US hegemony or international dominance through the formation of an international trade system Much of this dominance was structured around the ability to provide a central currency for trade through using the US dollar US Department of State By using sources such as The Economic Consequences of Rising US Government Debt as well as data derived from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean I was able to analyze potential correlations and causality between national debt and foreign debt levels in the s The Economic Consequences of Rising US Government Debt article was published in a German financial journal FinanzArchiv which focuses on the impacts of public finance on Germany Consulting this source allowed for an interesting outside perspective on the perils of US debt on the rest of the world The data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC released in was effectively a report done on the economic conditions of the world focusing on the fiscal impacts of economic factors on Latin America and the Caribbean This report was important because it had financial data that showed how the highinterest foreign debts held externally had a negative impact on the United States The report contained debt information pertaining to the United States and all the countries that held US external debts during the time period of my case study From this data I looked for trends of who was holding the US external debt what the cost of the debt was and how much debt was held over time With the information from these sources I looked at the impacts of external debts on the overall amount of US national debt over time These sources were used to determine the potential for reducing overall US national debt through a means of foreign debt reduction during this period of time and whether that approach would have been viable Results This research project deepened my understanding of how debt works and why debt is relevant to the US and international economy One key finding was that foreign debts and external debts in general are typically held at higher interest rates than debts held internally by a nation such as the United States My research revealed that in the s the national debt of the United States was largely held by two nations Japan and China However these nations decreased their holdings of US debts by approximately of what the two had held together a reduction of approximately of the United States total national debt at the time ECLAC This period of decreased holdings occurred just after the financial crisis and continued through the end of the study period Japan and China did this to avoid the risk of potential financial pitfalls such as the United States defaulting on a loan since it was in a recession This divestment was accomplished through decreased further financial investment which led to these securities being held internally by the US My research showed that a reduction in continued investment by nations such as Japan or China did not inherently correlate to a reduction in national debt something I was surprised to learn This was because of the fact that the nations were not eliminating the debts altogether but instead were reducing the amount of debt they held This means that the US debt shifted elsewhere primarily to internal holdings Internal debt is not subject to the same interest rates as external debts because of the obligations being owed to the government itself and not an outside entity Additionally internally held debt is more often focused on money being lent only to maintain the governments own operations However holding a greater percentage of debt internally is a smart move for the United States because between and there was approximately billion of interest on the US external debt ECLAC This bn figure is effectively the cost of debt held externally and is more expensive than if the same amount of debt had been held internally This gradual move from external to internal debts during the study period should have a positive impact on overall indebtedness because of the oftenlower interest rates on debts that are held internally by the government itself As is true of most debts reduction of higherinterest debt is a potential solution to decreasing the overall cost of the debt itself that cost being the economic burden that the debt carries Although the United States national debt was not reduced from decreasing external debts during the time period of my case study long term the larger degree of control US entities have over debt held within US borders will have a positive impact on our overall indebtedness The United States in its current state is reliant on debt to function in part to retain its status as a global hegemon Programs such as social security and MedicareMedicaid take on much of this burden of the debt because they are the programs lending the government funds so that necessary government functions can occur This causes burdens on these programs as they are lending money to the government instead of investing in the taxpayer Conclusion Reduction of the US national debt is a hot topic in many circles and the answer of how or whether the debt should be reduced is up for debate My research revealed that the United States in the s did not have a particular goal of reducing external debts andor the overall national debt This was evidenced by a rapidly increasing national debt during this period to blunt the recession While foreign debt was reduced during this time it did not have a significant impact on the overall US national debt in the s This was where an inconclusive answer to the research question came in It is important to note that as inflation occurs the relative cost of foreign debt increases In the time period of my case study this was not a significant issue but in the postpandemic era there is a much greater potential for this to become problematic with significant international economic inflation The bigpicture ramifications were that the US economy is working its way toward being less dependent on foreign debts and is attempting to not be overcome by highinterest external debts The national debt is currently escalating at a record pace and internal discretionary spending may be the culprit Coming into the election cycle postCovid it is very important to recognize the potential ramifications the massive US debt has on the public From this research I have gained knowledge on political questions and the way that the economy especially national debt does not follow as linear of a path as I originally expected I would like to thank my mentor Dr Reardon for helping to guide me through this project and helping me come up with a viable research plan I would also like to thank my friend Dylan Cordle who kept me on track reviewed my work and aided me when I needed it

debt,The US is in a record amount of debt Thats the national debt the total amount the federal government owes its creditors And now the trillion question Should we change our hardcharging ways or should we stop worrying and learn to love the debt How high should the governments debt be Is it bad to be in a lot of debt Should we make painful cuts to bring the debt down These are questions coming up a lot lately as the government comes up against another budget deadline in early March Yet again Congress will have to come to a budget agreement or risk a government shutdown How much do we owe anyway The US national debt totals about trillion That is a really hard number to really understand right said Rachel Snyderman the director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington DC Debt can be a great thing she said helping to fund important programs and deal with crises Still she said when the numbers get this big theyre almost impossible to really understand Does it help if I tell you that if you had trillion footlong Subway sandwiches and stacked them end to end you could get to Neptune and back Probably not so helpful but maybe NASA needs to know about this and also its been too long since Ive had a meatball sub Maybe its more useful to put that number into an economic context trillion is bigger than the Chinese economy Add to that the economies of Japan Germany India and the United Kingdom and combined they generate about trillion a year DebttoGDP Ratio The trillion is also bigger than our own economy The United States gross domestic product or GDP which is the sum total of all the goods and services we produce in a year is about is about trillion What this really shows is that the United States likes spending money more than it likes bringing in revenues Snyderman said Our debt is around of what our economy generates in a year thats our debttoGDP ratio Is a lot of national debt bad So if my friend Ralph was spending of what he earned I would strongly recommend he go on a strict spending regimen and probably stop eating Subway sandwiches entirely But countries are different they can print their own money So if youre a country is a lot of debt really bad Not so bad The truth is we just dont know In fact this very question sparked a major debate among economists in the last few years Thats the funny thing about the national debt Although the numbers are knowable very often the consequences are not Of course some consequences we do know like the amount of interest we pay on that debt about billion a day and by the Congressional Budget Office projects the interest payments on our debt will be the countrys single biggest expense Is that where Americans want their hard earned tax dollars going asked Snyderman Probably not Another potential consequence of the debt Trust issues And thats not as benign as it might sound When debt gets this high it can alarm investors said Raghuram Rajan a professor of finance at the University of Chicagos Booth School of Business who also served as chief economist at the International Monetary Fund Eventually you rack up huge debts and nobody trusts you anymore he explained Lets do the numbers In the world of debt if someone doesnt trust you they charge you a lot of interest when they lend you money If youre a country loans come in the form of government bonds So when Kai Ryssdal does the numbers and says Bond prices fell the yield on the year Tnote rose to Kai is talking about debt Tenyear Treasury notes are government bonds little loans the government sells But the amounts it sells are not so little The government sometimes sells hundreds of billions of dollars worth of government bonds in a week Bonds are the governments main source of revenue along with taxes Make no mistake the year Tnote is keeping the lights on The trouble with trust issues So the government loves its bonds and investors love them too US government bonds are one of the most popular investments on the planet The reason Safety US government bonds are perceived to be extremely safe Sometimes they are even referred to as a riskless asset And that safety might get called into question if US debt gets much higher said economist Rajan People might start to think Wow the US owes a lot of money Are they going to be able to pay all of this back If I lend them money will they be able to pay me back If that happens on a large scale that yield on the year Tnote Kai is always talking about will start going up and up Thats investors demanding higher interest rates for buying US bonds and lending the government money And that could be the moment when our billion a day in interest payments quickly balloons Rajan said And that will happen soon The truth is we dont know Thats the other tricky thing about national debt We dont know the limits and whenever we think we do we seem to be wrong says economist Rajan Is there a level of debttoGDP that we should worry about Yes What is that level We dont know What we do know is that so far investors havent really blinked even though conventional wisdom used to hold that a countrys debt should not get higher than of its GDP But Japan blew way past that its debttoGDP ratio is more than and nothing happened and then Italy has blown way past that its debttoGDP ratio is and nothing has happened Rajan said We are in totally uncharted territory Given all of that is a measly debttoGDP ratio really such a big deal The first rule of debt crises Beware because the nature of debt crises is that no one can see them coming said John Cochrane an economist at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution He said debt is an important tool for a country and its importance is why we should be so concerned Cochrane points out that during the Great Recession and the COVID shutdown the United States was able to swoop in fast with billions for bailouts stimulus checks and aid programs Government debt is a wonderful invention he said Governments should borrow and spend carefully during wars recessions crises But if the debt gets too big Cochrane cautioned the government might not be able to respond so decisively next time The money might be slower to come and the government might not be able to raise as much If we go into another hard time does the government have the capacity to persuade people Another

TODAY,national debt,The US governments national debt recently topped trillion a new record But how worried should you be about the countrys borrowing The debt has been a source of tension among politicians with lawmakers narrowly avoiding a default last year through a debt ceiling deal Neither side of the aisle was completely happy with the agreement conservative members had been advocating for deeper cuts while liberals objected to components like expanded work requirements for food stamps and future spending caps Spending deals have continued to come under fire by ultraconservative lawmakers despite the risk of a government shutdown Congressional leaders on Jan announced a deal on a shortterm funding bill that will keep the governments doors open into March The deal follows an agreement made the previous week between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY and House Speaker Mike Johnson RLa to set the overall government spending at trillion for fiscal year Johnson said he doesnt plan to back out of the deal despite calls from rightwing lawmakers to make deeper spending cuts Economists dont agree on how worrisome the debt levels are today but studies show an increasing number of Americans believe it needs to be addressed as federal spending consistently outpaces its revenue Over the past five decades the country has typically run on a budget deficit in which the government spends more money in a given year than it takes in This leads to borrowing that contributes to the national debt The US has run a deficit in all but four years since with the most recent budget surplus a year in which the government takes in more than it spends in A Pew Research Center survey found that of Americans said reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority for the president and Congress up from the year prior Heres what to know about the national debt and what the rising levels could mean for you What is the national debt The national debt is the total amount of money the US owes its creditors which includes the public individual investors businesses commercial banks pension funds mutual funds state and local governments the Federal Reserve System and foreign governments as well as other parts of the federal government including Social Security Medicare and other specialized trust funds The US has carried debt since its inception but the number has spiked in recent years thanks in part to costly events like the COVID pandemic Tax cuts stimulus programs government spending and lower tax revenue also contributed to the debt load The trillion figure looms large but experts say its important to put the number in context People sort of overreact to the number Because of inflation that number is always going to get bigger said Betsey Stevenson a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan We usually want to try to make some sense of the number by scaling it in a way that is a little bit easier to understand One method is calculating debt held by the public as a percent of gross domestic product This figure stood at at the end of down from nearly in The US Office of Management and Budget expects this figure to continue to rise and by surpass the previous record of from right after World War II Child tax credit increaseNew bipartisan bill proposes increase in child tax credit higher business deductions There is no doubt that both in raw and proportionate terms the US government carries a substantial debt load according to Brett House a professor of economics at Columbia Business School But he said that debt might be the price we need to pay to ensure money keeps flowing to essential programs We face a massive climate challenge that needs funding We also face the need to keep increasing productivity both in the public sector and in the private sector House said That sort of fiscal spending he argues can raise the countrys ability to pay off its debt over time by boosting GDP and tax revenue thereby making sustainable the debt incurred to finance that spending he said How much debt can the US take on Its unclear just how much debt is too much for the country to bear We dont know how high this thing can go said David Andolfatto a professor of economics at the University of Miami But we do know that theres likely a limit Research from the University of Pennsylvanias Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that the US debt held by the public cannot exceed roughly of the GDP per findings published late last year They estimate that financial markets can sustain about years of accumulated deficits projected under current US fiscal policy After that no amount of future tax increases or spending cuts could prevent the government from defaulting or being unable to pay its debt The Treasury Department says its unclear exactly what sort of repercussions would follow a default but it would likely have catastrophic repercussions in the United States and in markets across the globe What does the national debt mean for interest rates Some economists say the debt levels could lead to more challenges for Americans down the road by hiking the cost of borrowing If the government starts pumping out a lot of debt interest rates are going to rise and then your mortgage rate is going to rise as well Andolfatto said Another concern is that as the debt and interest keep growing the government will cut funding to programs like Social Security and Medicare Net interest costs reached billion in fiscal up from the previous year according to the Treasury Department If we just have the debt keep growing we have to pay interest on that Stevenson of the University of Michigan said So we have to spend more just to pay the interest on the debt which means that more of our budget needs to go towards the interest on the debt But some experts including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen say that interest payments as a share of GDP remain at a reasonable level The figure remained under in compared with more than in the early s What about inflation Higher inflation is another concern among some economists Higher levels of debt through cutting taxes or government spending could put more money in consumers pockets prompting them to spend more This could cause the inflation rates to swell according to Andolfatto Generally economists think that when households feel wealthier theyre likely to spend more he said And that spending could drive up prices as demand for goods soars However some economists say its not clear that the national debt is triggering inflation or higher interest rates So far neither of those things have proven to be related to the level of government spending that weve had over long periods of time that have led to that accumulation of debt load House said But that could change While the future remains uncertain House added that hitting a record trillion in debt does not mean the sky is falling With any of these deficits and debt numbers they have to be put in context given the size of the US economy House told USA TODAY And the US is continuing to be amongst the growth leaders of the industrialized world To default or not to defaultWhat debt ceiling deal means for the economy and your wallet Whats next Americans could start to see the ramifications of the national debt as lawmakers take steps to address it by raising taxes cutting spending or a combination of both Were going to have to make some hard choices about what we want to spend money on and what were willing to pay for and how we want to raise that money Stevenson said The record debt is not a time to be alarmed but its a time to pause and say There is this disconnect between what wed like our governments to provide the goods and services and the safety net and support in retirement and what weve currently set up as a system for raising revenue And we need to solve that problem she said,National debt hits trillion Heres what

Mail,national debt,Nearly two decades ago David Walker went on tour across the United States Not as a rock star or a travelling preacher though he did have a sermon to spread Instead Mr Walker was the countrys chief beancounter and his message for his fellow Americans was grim The US was suffering from a fiscal cancer the then comptrollergeneral told the public on what he called his Fiscal Wakeup Tour Spiralling deficits and debt would have catastrophic consequences if left untreated His pleas were ignored What followed was yearafteryear of unrestrained borrowing as a potent combination of falling interest rates and entrenched political division allowed spending plans to mushroom even as tax cuts left Washingtons coffers empty Large swaths of the rest of the world eagerly joined in the debtfinancing party including Canada where the Liberal governments billiondeficit budget this week yet again ramped up spending by tens of billions of dollars By next year a generation of Canadians will have been born and become adults since the federal government last balanced its books While Canada and the US may seem as if theyre on different planets when it comes to what they owe just over trillion for Canada compared with roughly trillion in Canadian dollars for the US both are now spending as much on interest payments as they do on programs they each hold dear Canada will fork out billion this year in debt costs more than Ottawa will send to the provinces in health transfers while for every dollar the US spends on defence it will pay that much in interest to its lenders All told by the gross public debt of advanced economy governments worldwide is forecast to exceed per cent of GDP the highest level since the Second World War according to the International Monetary Fund The bottom line is elected officials are addicted to spending deficits and debt Mr Walker told The Globe and Mail But I do think we are approaching an inflection point For one thing credit rating agencies have begun kicking up more of a fuss about the sustainability of government borrowing Last fall Fitch one of the big three rating agencies cut the United States credit rating from AAA to AA while another Moodys later lowered the outlook on its US credit rating to negative from stable At the provincial level in Canada British Columbia which is expected to post the largest deficittoGDP of all the provinces this fiscal year had its own credit rating cut by SP Global Ratings this month BCs third downgrade in three years of overspending In the US there have also been cracks in the longheld assumption that the worlds appetite for American bonds regarded as the safest investment on the planet might not be as bottomless as once thought As if to drive home that message this week the IMF took aim at the United States UStrillion debt load The United States surprisingly strong economic performance is owing in part to a fiscal stance that is out of line with longterm fiscal sustainability the organizations chief economist PierreOlivier Gourinchas wrote in a bulletin Something will have to give Of course given the United States vast size and role at the centre of global financial markets even if Canada and other countries transformed into bastions of fiscal virtue they could still face fallout from Washingtons continuing recklessness As the IMF also warned this week runaway debt and loose fiscal policies could push up longterm borrowing costs for other countries and pose significant risks to the global economy Yet its still unclear exactly what unsustainable means when it comes to government debt both in terms of how much is too much and when that tipping point might arrive Its certainly not the same for every country experts say But against a backdrop of higherforlonger short and longterm interest rates after so many years when it seemed as if debt didnt matter suddenly it does The scale of the United States debt burden can be mindboggling Heres one way to think about it Over the past year the US has added UStrillion in new debt an average of every days As of this week the federal debt stands at UStrillion according to the US Treasury Department That includes a lot of debt that other arms of the US government hold and so when thats excluded the actual debt held by the public is closer to UStrillion which is still a staggering per cent of GDP In other words for every dollar of output by the largest and most powerful economy on the planet its also in hock to someone else for another dollar And that ratio is only projected to climb by the Congressional Budget Office projects debttoGDP will top per cent Canadas debt picture is not as grim provided everything in the economy unfolds as optimistically as this weeks budget forecasts According to the budget the federal debttoGDP ratio will gradually decline from per cent to per cent in while the deficit will drop below per cent of GDP within three years Thats largely thanks to a billion windfall of tax revenue that will come from raising the inclusion rate on capital gains of more than from onehalf to twothirds While Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland framed the budget as responsible not everyone agrees particularly when you consider this budget in the context of all the others that preceded it Theyve dramatically increased spending doubled the national debt and increased the federal civil service said Laurence Booth a finance professor at University of Torontos Rotman School of Management That is not a sign of a prudent government Once the provinces are included in Canadas debt picture things begin to look even less rosy In a recent report economists at Bank of Montreal estimated that based on all the red ink featured in provincial budgets this year total provincial debt will increase more than billion a record jump equivalent to per cent of GDP and larger than the debt loads they took on during the first year of the pandemic Amid rising demands for services a prolonged era of cheap debt that lasted until and the churn of election cycles it is not a surprise that governments for a long time saw little upside to being champions of fiscal discipline In the US President Joe Biden isnt slowing spending particularly in an election year with so much at stake while his rival Donald Trump is promising massive tax cuts Both policies would only leave an even bigger hole in US finances Open this photo in gallery Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland are joined by cabinet ministers before the tabling of the federal budget on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on April Justin TangThe Canadian Press Many also see the Trudeau governments budget as an election gambit as it tries to shore up support among young voters dissatisfied with rising costs Mr Walker reminisces about the United States last fiscally responsible president Bill Clinton Likewise Tony Fell the former chief executive officer of RBC Dominion Securities complains that the last time Canada displayed fiscal sanity was under the Liberal government of Jean Chrtien when Paul Martin was finance minister Theres nobody up there even thinking that way now History holds many examples where governments of countries that allowed their finances to deteriorate for too long were suddenly forced to adopt prudence over profligacy including Canada in the early s when Mr Chrtien and Mr Martin wrestled the federal budget under control after straight years of deficits Their fiscal anchor was not just slightly smaller deficits but repeated balanced budgets and a rapidly falling debttoGDP ratio The question is will this be one of those moments of reckoning for the worlds big public borrowers In the lead up to this weeks budget as economists and investors waited to see if the Trudeau government would hold to its own fiscal anchors of a downward sloping debttoGDP ratio and deficits below per cent of GDP in and onwards Royal Bank of Canada issued a warning that Canada should not take its vaunted AAA credit rating for granted Key metrics indicate its fiscal position is among the more vulnerable relative to other AAA rated economies economist Rachel Battaglia wrote This suggests Canada is at a greater risk of a downgrade than other toprated peers As it turned out Ms Battaglia said the budget likely met the mark fiscally But that doesnt mean rating agencies wont be keeping a close eye on Ottawas books for signs of trouble since those weaknesses she pointed to still stand For instance while Canada compares favourably when looking at government net debttoGDP which includes the value of financial assets such as the Canada Pension Plan Canadas gross debt levels are much higher than other AAArated countries at per cent versus per cent for Germany or per cent for Denmark That translates into higher debt servicing costs than other AAArated countries which has a knockon effect of trickling down to consumers and businesses who ultimately are paying more to service their mortgages and loans she said The biggest metric credit rating agencies may be watching in Canada however is its productivity performance which is poor relative to other countries Weak productivity can put downward pressure on revenues which limits the governments ability to fund its operations without raising taxes or tacking on even more debt she said The credit rating agencies are definitely watching that Even if thats the case Prof Booth doesnt think rating agencies are in any rush to downgrade Canada Even if they did he doesnt believe it would make much difference to borrowing costs since investor demand has remained strong for federal bonds Thats more or less what happened in the US after when SP Global Ratings slashed Americas AAA rating to AA Clearly lenders werent scared away The bigger worry for any sovereign lender is market sentiment Investor confidence can be fickle and herd mentality can easily take hold much as it does in the case of a bank run when everything seems fine one day and the next crowds are rushing the exits It all comes down to supply and demand Prof Booth said Governments supply bonds and the question is whether investors want them If they dont youre into a buyers revolt yields start increasing and you know youre reaching the limit Or as Ms Battaglia puts it Debt isnt a problem until it is The problem is its virtually impossible to nail down exactly where the tipping point lies between government debt levels that might draw tablethumping from fiscal hawks but otherwise keep swelling and a debt load that suddenly plunges your country into a fiscal crisis Some have tried to identify a hard debt line One highly touted academic paper by Harvard Universitys Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff claimed an analysis of countries showed that once debt rises above per cent of GDP real economic growth turns slightly negative an analysis often marshalled to justify austerity crusades in the wake of the Great Recession until a spreadsheet error in their research was later uncovered that debunked their findings For countries such as Portugal Italy Ireland Greece and Spain a group once offensively derided as PIIGS amid the European sovereign debt crisis from to exploding deficits and a surge in debttoGDP levels above per cent sent their borrowing costs spiralling higher as investors lost faith in each countrys ability to pay off its debts What Canada and the US have that those countries didnt as members of the euro bloc is control of their own currencies which means central banks can buy their countrys debt to finance government operations and keep interest rates low as both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada did on a large scale during the pandemic The same cant be said for Canadas provinces and bond markets have already signalled their unhappiness when provincial governments have failed to live up to fiscal guardrails theyve set for themselves Quebecs recent budget with its historic billion deficit that put its longterm net debttoGDP target further out of reach is a case in point after the budgets release bond markets immediately pushed up the provinces borrowing costs Ms Battaglia said Yet countries that can print their own money are finding bond investors can lose their patience in abrupt fashion such as the collapse of Liz Trusss Conservative government in Britain in September of In that instance Ms Truss touched off a revolt among bond investors when she announced plans to slash corporate taxes while simultaneously ramping up deficitfuelled spending to boost growth Almost immediately the value of the British pound and government bonds collapsed Three weeks later Ms Truss was forced to scrap the plan and step down having famously been outlasted by a notyetwilted head of lettuce That episode continues to lurk in the shadows as the United States debt levels surge Last month Phillip Swagel the director of the Congressional Budget Office warned the United States unprecedented debt trajectory could lead to a similar shock The danger of course is what the UK faced he told the Financial Times Such a crisis wasnt imminent in the US he said but the risk is there There have been some signs that US bond markets may be suffering some indigestion as they try to absorb record levels of treasuries sold at auction last fall longterm yields jumped amid worries about US deficits and whether they were adding to inflation Yet there is no way to know what the breaking point is for US debt if one even exists or when it might come In a recent report the Penn Wharton Budget Model PWBM a nonpartisan fiscal policy research group at the University of Pennsylvania tried to determine what unsustainable US federal debt looked like The model assumed that at some point drastic fiscal policy action will be taken but determined the US debt held by the public cannot exceed per cent of GDP and that a ratio of per cent is more plausible It also found the US has roughly years for corrective action after which no amount of future tax increases or spending cuts could avoid the government defaulting on its debt Ultimately it comes down to when capital markets stop believing that the government will solve its debt problem said Prof Kent Smetters the PWBMs faculty director Theoretically it could happen tomorrow The problem is he said the US government has become numb to the idea of using debt on a massive scale to get through crises such as the Great Recession and the pandemic What happens when the crisis itself is caused by debt,How much is too much Analyzing the US and Canadas government debt problem The Globe and Mail Nearly two decades ago David Walker went on tour across the United States Not as a rock star or a travelling preacher though he did have a sermon to spread Instead Mr Walker was the countrys chief beancounter and his message for his fellow Americans was grim The US was suffering from a fiscal cancer the then comptrollergeneral told the public on what he called his Fiscal Wakeup Tour Spiralling deficits and debt would have catastrophic consequences if left untreated His pleas were ignored What followed was yearafteryear of unrestrained borrowing as a potent combination of falling interest rates and entrenched political division allowed spending plans to mushroom even as tax cuts left Washingtons coffers empty Large swaths of the rest of the world eagerly joined in the debtfinancing party including Canada where the Liberal governments billiondeficit budget this week yet again ramped up spending by tens of billions of dollars By next year a generation of Canadians will have been born and become adults since the federal government last balanced its books While Canada and the US may seem as if theyre on different planets when it comes to what they owe just over trillion for Canada compared with roughly trillion in Canadian dollars for the US both are now spending as much on interest payments as they do on programs they each hold dear Canada will fork out billion this year in debt costs more than Ottawa will send to the provinces in health transfers while for every dollar the US spends on defence it will pay that much in interest to its lenders All told by the gross public debt of advanced economy governments worldwide is forecast to exceed per cent of GDP the highest level since the Second World War according to the International Monetary Fund The bottom line is elected officials are addicted to spending deficits and debt Mr Walker told The Globe and Mail But I do think we are approaching an inflection point For one thing credit rating agencies have begun kicking up more of a fuss about the sustainability of government borrowing Last fall Fitch one of the big three rating agencies cut the United States credit rating from AAA to AA while another Moodys later lowered the outlook on its US credit rating to negative from stable At the provincial level in Canada British Columbia which is expected to post the largest deficittoGDP of all the provinces this fiscal year had its own credit rating cut by SP Global Ratings this month BCs third downgrade in three years of overspending In the US there have also been cracks in the longheld assumption that the worlds appetite for American bonds regarded as the safest investment on the planet might not be as bottomless as once thought As if to drive home that message this week the IMF took aim at the United States UStrillion debt load The United States surprisingly strong economic performance is owing in part to a fiscal stance that is out of line with longterm fiscal sustainability the organizations chief economist PierreOlivier Gourinchas wrote in a bulletin Something will have to give Of course given the United States vast size and role at the centre of global financial markets even if Canada and other countries transformed into bastions of fiscal virtue they could still face fallout from Washingtons continuing recklessness As the IMF also warned this week runaway debt and loose fiscal policies could push up longterm borrowing costs for other countries and pose significant risks to the global economy Yet its still unclear exactly what unsustainable means when it comes to government debt both in terms of how much is too much and when that tipping point might arrive Its certainly not the same for every country experts say But against a backdrop of higherforlonger short and longterm interest rates after so many years when it seemed as if debt didnt matter suddenly it does The scale of the United States debt burden can be mindboggling Heres one way to think about it Over the past year the US has added UStrillion in new debt an average of every days As of this week the federal debt stands at UStrillion according to the US Treasury Department That includes a lot of debt that other arms of the US government hold and so when thats excluded the actual debt held by the public is closer to UStrillion which is still a staggering per cent of GDP In other words for every dollar of output by the largest and most powerful economy on the planet its also in hock to someone else for another dollar And that ratio is only projected to climb by the Congressional Budget Office projects debttoGDP will top per cent Canadas debt picture is not as grim provided everything in the economy unfolds as optimistically as this weeks budget forecasts According to the budget the federal debttoGDP ratio will gradually decline from per cent to per cent in while the deficit will drop below per cent of GDP within three years Thats largely thanks to a billion windfall of tax revenue that will come from raising the inclusion rate on capital gains of more than from onehalf to twothirds While Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland framed the budget as responsible not everyone agrees particularly when you consider this budget in the context of all the others that preceded it Theyve dramatically increased spending doubled the national debt and increased the federal civil service said Laurence Booth a finance professor at University of Torontos Rotman School of Management That is not a sign of a prudent government Once the provinces are included in Canadas debt picture things begin to look even less rosy In a recent report economists at Bank of Montreal estimated that based on all the red ink featured in provincial budgets this year total provincial debt will increase more than billion a record jump equivalent to per cent of GDP and larger than the debt loads they took on during the first year of the pandemic Amid rising demands for services a prolonged era of cheap debt that lasted until and the churn of election cycles it is not a surprise that governments for a long time saw little upside to being champions of fiscal discipline In the US President Joe Biden isnt slowing spending particularly in an election year with so much at stake while his rival Donald Trump is promising massive tax cuts Both policies would only leave an even bigger hole in US finances Open this photo in gallery Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland are joined by cabinet ministers before the tabling of the federal budget on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on April Justin TangThe Canadian Press Many also see the Trudeau governments budget as an election gambit as it tries to shore up support among young voters dissatisfied with rising costs Mr Walker reminisces about the United States last fiscally responsible president Bill Clinton Likewise Tony Fell the former chief executive officer of RBC Dominion Securities complains

payments is forecast to hit billion this year exceeding the billion that the nation will spend on defense in according to a recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office This years outlay for interest payments represents a increase from last years billion in interest expense To be sure higher interest rates arent the only factor raising the cost of servicing the countrys debt Over the last decade the US has almost doubled its outstanding debt which surged to trillion last year from trillion in according to Treasury data Why interest payments have soared The nations ballooning debt stems chiefly from tax cuts enacted by former President Donald Trump in as well as the surge in federal aid to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic assistance authorized by both Trump and President Joe Biden On top of that with the Federal Reserve turning to its most effective antiinflation tool higher interest rates the US is paying more for its growing pile of debt Thats steering the US into

core programs like Social Security or to invest in initiatives that drive economic growth such as infrastructure or education Interest is projected this year to be the secondlargest federal program it

government programs A lot of folks tend to say interest is a waste of money and thats not true Kogan told CBS MoneyWatch The decision to have interest payments happened because we decided not to do tax increases or spending cuts Second spending more on interest doesnt equate with cuts in programs Its not true that if interest is higher its impossible to spend a dollar more on nutrition assistance he said The idea that this interest is crowding out other government spending isnt mechanically definitively true in any sense per person Another key point to consider is that the nations

US national debt hits record $34 trillion as Congress gears up for funding fight - The Associated Press,US national debt hits record $34 trillion as Congress gears up for funding fight  The Associated

Associated Press,national debt,WASHINGTON AP The federal governments gross national debt has surpassed trillion a record high that foreshadows the coming political and economic challenges to improve Americas balance sheet in the coming years The US Treasury Department issued a report Tuesday logging US finances which have become a source of tension in a politically divided Washington that could possibly see parts of the government shutdown without an annual budget in place Republican lawmakers and the White House agreed last June to temporarily lift the nations debt limit staving off the risk of what would be a historic default That agreement lasts until January Here are some answers to questions about the new record national debt HOW DID THE NATIONAL DEBT HIT TRILLION The national debt eclipsed trillion several years sooner than prepandemic projections The Congressional Budget Offices January projections had gross federal debt eclipsing trillion in fiscal year But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multiyear pandemic starting in that shut down much of the US economy The government borrowed heavily under then President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden to stabilize the economy and support a recovery But the rebound came with a surge of inflation that pushed up interest rates and made it more expensive for the government to service its debts So far Washington has been spending money as if we had unlimited resources said Sung Won Sohn an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University But the bottom line is there is no free lunch he said and I think the outlook is pretty grim The gross debt includes money that the government owes itself so most policymakers rely on the total debt held by the public in assessing the governments finances This lower figure trillion is roughly equal in size to the US gross domestic product Last June the Congressional Budget Office estimated in its year outlook that publicly held debt will be equal to a record of American economic activity by WHAT IS THE IMPACT TO THE ECONOMY The national debt does not appear to be a weight on the US economy right now as investors are willing to lend the federal government money This lending allows the government to keep spending on programs without having to raise taxes But the debts path in the decades to come might put at risk national security and major programs including Social Security and Medicare which have become the most prominent drivers of forecasted government spending over the next few decades Government dysfunction such as another debt limit showdown could also be a financial risk if investors worry about lawmakers willingness to repay the US debt Foreign buyers of US debt like China Japan South Korea and European nations have already cut down on their holdings of Treasury notes A Peterson Foundation analysis states that foreign holdings of US debt peaked at percent in but dropped to percent by the end of Looking ahead debt will continue to skyrocket as the Treasury expects to borrow nearly trillion more by the end of March said Peterson Foundation CEO Michael Peterson Adding trillion after trillion in debt year after year should be a flashing red warning sign to any policymaker who cares about the future of our country HOW COULD IT AFFECT ME The debt equates to about per person in the US That sounds like a lot but the sum so far has not appeared to threaten US economic growth Instead the risk is long term if the debt keeps rising to uncharted levels Sohn said a higher debt load could put upward pressure on inflation and cause interest rates to remain elevated which could also increase the cost of repaying the national debt And as the debt challenge evolves over time choices may become more severe as the costs of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid increasingly outstrip tax revenues When it could turn into a more dire situation is anyones guess says Shai Akabas director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center but if and when that happens it could mean very significant consequences that occur very quickly It could mean spikes in interest rates it could mean a recession that leads to lots more unemployment It could lead to another bout of inflation or weird going on with consumer prices several of which are things that weve experienced just in the past few years he said HOW DO REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS DIFFER Both Democrats and Republicans have called for debt reduction but they disagree on the appropriate means of doing so The Biden administration has been pushing for tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations to reduce budget deficits in addition to funding its domestic agenda Biden also increased the budget for the IRS so that it can collect unpaid taxes and possibly reduce the debt by hundreds of billions of dollars over years Republican lawmakers have called for large cuts to nondefense government programs and the repeal of clean energy tax credits and spending passed in the Inflation Reduction Act But Republicans also want to trim Bidens IRS funding and cut taxes further both of which could cause the debt to worsen Both claims are previews of cases that will likely be put to voters in this years presidential election White House spokesman Michael Kikukawa put the blame on the GOP saying in a statement that the steady accrual over years was trickledown debt driven overwhelmingly by repeated Republican giveaways skewed to big corporations and the wealthy By contrast Republican lawmakers have said that borrowing during the Biden administration contributed to the spike in inflation rates that dragged down the Democratic presidents approval ratings Akabas said There is growing concern among investors and rating agencies that the trajectory were on is unsustainable when that turns into a more dire situation is anyones guess,US national debt hits record trillion as Congress gears up for funding fight The Associated Press WASHINGTON AP The federal governments gross national debt has surpassed trillion a record high that foreshadows the coming political and economic challenges to improve Americas balance sheet in the coming years The US Treasury Department issued a report Tuesday logging US finances which have become a source of tension in a politically divided Washington that could possibly see parts of the government shutdown without an annual budget in place Republican lawmakers and the White House agreed last June to temporarily lift the nations debt limit staving off the risk of what would be a historic default That agreement lasts until January Here are some answers to questions about the new record national debt HOW DID THE NATIONAL DEBT HIT TRILLION The national debt eclipsed trillion several years sooner than prepandemic projections The Congressional Budget Offices January projections had gross federal debt eclipsing trillion in fiscal year But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multiyear pandemic starting in that shut down much of the US economy The government borrowed heavily under then President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden to stabilize the economy and support a recovery But the rebound came with a surge of inflation that pushed up interest rates and made it more expensive for the government to service its debts So far Washington has been spending money as if we had unlimited resources said Sung Won Sohn an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University But the bottom line is there is no free lunch he said and I think the outlook is pretty grim The gross debt includes money that the government owes itself so most policymakers rely on the total debt held by the public in assessing the governments finances This lower figure trillion is roughly equal in size to the US gross domestic product Last June the Congressional Budget Office estimated in its year outlook that publicly held debt will be equal to a record of American economic activity by WHAT IS THE IMPACT TO THE ECONOMY The national debt does not appear to be a weight on the US economy right now as investors are willing to lend the federal government money This lending allows the government to keep spending on programs without having to raise taxes But the debts path in the decades to come might put at risk national security and major programs including Social Security and Medicare which have become the most prominent drivers of forecasted government spending over the next few decades Government dysfunction such as another debt limit showdown could also be a financial risk if investors worry about lawmakers willingness to repay the US debt Foreign buyers of US debt like China Japan South Korea and European nations have already cut down on their holdings of Treasury notes A Peterson Foundation analysis states that foreign holdings of US debt peaked at percent in but dropped to percent by the end of Looking ahead debt will continue to skyrocket as the Treasury expects to borrow nearly trillion more by the end of March said Peterson Foundation CEO Michael Peterson Adding trillion after trillion in debt year after year should be a flashing red warning sign to any policymaker who cares about the future of our country HOW COULD IT AFFECT ME The debt equates to about per person in the US That sounds like a lot but the sum so far has not appeared to threaten US economic growth Instead the risk is long term if the debt keeps rising to uncharted levels Sohn said a higher debt load could put upward pressure on inflation and cause interest rates to remain elevated which could also increase the cost of repaying the national debt And as the debt challenge evolves over time choices may become more severe as the costs of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid increasingly outstrip tax revenues When it could turn into a more dire situation is anyones guess says Shai Akabas director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center but if and when that happens it could mean very significant consequences that occur very quickly It could mean spikes in interest rates it could mean a recession that leads to lots more unemployment It could lead to another bout of inflation or weird going on with consumer prices several of which are things that weve experienced just in the past few years he said HOW DO REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS DIFFER Both Democrats and Republicans have called for debt reduction but they disagree on the appropriate means of doing so The Biden administration has been pushing for tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations to reduce budget deficits in addition to funding its domestic agenda Biden also increased the budget for the IRS so that it can collect unpaid taxes and possibly reduce the debt by hundreds of billions of dollars over years Republican lawmakers have called for large cuts to nondefense government programs and the repeal of clean energy tax credits and spending passed in the Inflation Reduction Act But Republicans also want to trim Bidens IRS funding and cut taxes further both of which could cause the debt to worsen Both claims are previews of cases that will likely be put to voters in this years presidential election White House spokesman Michael Kikukawa put the blame on the GOP saying in a statement that the steady accrual over years was trickledown debt driven overwhelmingly by repeated Republican giveaways skewed to big corporations and the wealthy By contrast Republican lawmakers have said that borrowing during the Biden administration contributed to the spike in inflation rates that dragged down the Democratic presidents approval ratings Akabas said There is growing concern among investors and rating agencies that

lot of spending by Democrats and Republicans alike From the collapse of Lehman Brothers to the final year of Barack Obamas presidency the national debt rose from about a third of GDP to roughly three quarters It maintained that level for the first years of the Trump administration until the pandemic hit whereupon it rose sharply again to almost percent of GDP where it has been ever since Advertisement In other words most of our national debt was accumulated during the twin crises of the Great Recession and the pandemic Much of this was due to higher spending especially on the pandemic

countrys public debt to its gross domestic product GDP Looking at a countrys debt compared with its GDP is similar to a lender looking at someones credit historyit reveals how likely the country is to pay back its debt The debttoGDP ratio is usually expressed as a percentage and is used as a reliable indicator of a countrys economic situation because it compares what the country owes to what it produces in turn showing its ability to repay the debt The higher a countrys debttoGDP ratio the less likely the country is to pay off its debt This also puts the country at higher risk of default which is concerning to investors as it could cause financial panic in domestic and international markets According to a study by the World Bank countries with a debttoGDP ratio above for a prolonged period experience significant slowdowns in economic growth As of the third quarter of the US debttoGDP ratio was The US debttoGDP ratio has been above since following the financial crisis that started in The graph below shows the debttoGDP ratio for the US from to Dont confuse the terms debt and deficit While they may seem similar they are separate Debt is the running total of what the government owes to its creditors including budget deficits and surpluses Types of Debt Included in the National Debt There are different types of debt that comprise the national debt Weve highlighted some of them below Marketable and Nonmarketable Securities Marketable securities such as Treasury bills bonds notes and Treasury InflationProtected Securities TIPS can be traded on the secondary market and their ownership can be transferred from one person or entity to another Nonmarketable securities which include savings bonds government account series and state and local government series cant be sold to other investors Debt Held by the Public The US federal debt is mainly held by the American public followed by foreign governments US banks and investors This portion of the debt held by the public doesnt include US debt held by the federal government or intragovernmental debt Debt held by the public includes individuals corporations state or local governments Federal Reserve banks foreign investors and governments and other entities outside the US government The increase in the US national debt since One of the main causes of the jump in publicly held federal debt was the increased funding of programs and services during the COVID pandemic Intragovernmental Debt Intragovernmental debt is debt held by the government itself It is what one part of the government owes to another part Intragovernmental debt hasnt increased as sharply as publicly held debt over the past decade because it mainly includes debt on federal programs surplus revenue invested in Treasury debt The US national debt doesnt include debt carried by state and local governments or personal debt carried by individuals such as credit cards and mortgages Tracking Maintaining and Managing the National Debt The Bureau of the Fiscal Service provides accounting and reporting services for the government and manages all federal payments and collections One of the Fiscal Services main roles is to track and report the national debt Like the rest of us the federal government is also charged interest for borrowing money How much interest the government pays depends on the total national debt and the interest rates of different securities When the target range for the federal funds rate fed rate is increased by the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC carrying debt becomes more expensive for the government too Interest expenses have been relatively stable despite debt rising every year over the past decade thanks to low interest rates However when interest rates increase maintaining the national debt gets more costly As the Federal Reserve has repeatedly raised benchmark interest rates since to cool high inflation the US could pay as much as trillion more on interest payments for the national debt this decade according to the Peter G Peterson Foundation The Treasurys main goal when managing national debt is to ensure that the federal government is able to borrow at the lowest cost over time The Treasury does this by offering marketable securities that are attractive to a wide variety of investors because they are safe and liquid Constantly changing financial markets and uncertainty about future borrowing needs and the debt limit make the Treasurys debt management efforts challenging The Treasury needs to consider the amount of securities it offers to investors in the context of whats happening in the financial markets and to be prepared for policy changes and economic events that could significantly affect federal cash flow and borrowing needs The Debt Ceiling The debt ceiling or debt limit is the maximum amount that the US government can borrow by issuing bonds When the debt ceiling is reached the Treasury must find other ways to pay expenses If what the federal government owes reaches the debt limit and that limit is not raised there is a risk that the US will default on its debt This sounds alarm bells for investors because that could have severe consequences for national and global markets To avoid the risk of default the debt ceiling needs to be raised by Congress which has been done many times In January US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced that the US government hit its debt ceiling Yellen said the US government would take extraordinary measures to prevent a sovereign default which could come in mid if the debt ceiling isnt raised or abolished altogether Extraordinary measures authorized by Congress would temporarily suspend certain intragovernmental debt allowing the Treasury to borrow more money for a limited amount of time The debt ceiling was last raised to trillion a record in late a limit that has now been reachedby President Joe Biden and Congress In June a deal was struck between Democrats and Republicans to suspend the debt ceiling and allow further spending until How Much Does the US Pay on Its Debt Every Year Paying down or servicing the national debt is one of the federal governments biggest expenses According to the Congressional Budget Office net interest payments on the federal debt were billion in and are projected to rise to billion in What Is the Current US Debt As of January the US national debt was over trillion When Was the US National Debt the Highest Looking at national debt in terms of debttoGDP ratio the federal debt rose to an alltime high of in the second quarter of due to the pandemicfueled recession The Bottom Line The national debt is the total amount of money that a country owes to its creditors The government spends money on programs such as healthcare education and Social Security and accumulates debt by borrowing to cover the outstanding balance of expenses incurred over time Major economic and political events such as recessions wars or pandemics can affect government spending In early the US government hit the debt limit again This is the maximum amount it can borrow before the debt limit is suspended If the debt ceiling is reached and not suspended or raised by Congress the federal government could default on its debt This has never happened but if it does it could have significant ramifications for US and global markets,US National Debt by Year

National Debt The Bureau of the Fiscal Service provides accounting and reporting services for the government and manages all federal payments and collections One of the Fiscal Services main roles is to track and report the national debt Like the rest of us the federal government is also charged interest for borrowing money How much interest the government pays depends on the total national debt and the interest rates of different securities When the target range for the federal funds rate fed rate is increased by the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC carrying debt becomes more expensive for the government too Interest expenses have been relatively stable despite debt rising every year over the past decade thanks to low interest rates However when interest rates increase maintaining the national debt gets more costly As the Federal Reserve has repeatedly raised benchmark interest rates since to cool high inflation the US could pay as much as trillion more on interest payments for the national debt this decade according to the Peter G Peterson Foundation The Treasurys main goal when managing national debt is to ensure that the federal government is able to borrow at the lowest cost over time The Treasury does this by offering marketable securities that are attractive to a wide variety of investors because they are safe and liquid Constantly changing financial markets and uncertainty about future borrowing needs and the debt limit make the Treasurys debt management efforts challenging The Treasury needs to consider the amount of securities it offers to investors in the context of whats happening in the financial markets and to be prepared for policy changes and economic events that could significantly affect federal cash flow and borrowing needs The Debt Ceiling The debt ceiling or debt limit is the maximum amount that the US government can borrow by issuing bonds When the debt ceiling is reached the Treasury must find other ways to pay expenses If what the federal government owes reaches the debt limit and that limit is not raised there is a risk that the US will default on its debt This sounds alarm bells for investors because that could have severe consequences for national and global markets To avoid the risk of default the debt ceiling needs to be raised by Congress which has been done many times In January US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced that the US government hit its debt ceiling Yellen said the US government would take extraordinary measures to prevent a sovereign default which could come in mid if the debt ceiling isnt raised or abolished altogether Extraordinary measures authorized by Congress would temporarily suspend certain intragovernmental debt allowing the Treasury to borrow more money for a limited amount of time The debt ceiling was last raised to trillion a record in late a limit that has now been reachedby President Joe Biden and Congress In June a deal was struck between Democrats and Republicans to suspend the debt ceiling and allow further spending until How Much Does the US Pay on Its Debt Every Year Paying down or servicing the national debt is one of the federal governments biggest expenses According to the Congressional Budget Office net interest payments on the federal debt were billion in and are projected to rise to billion in What Is the Current US Debt As of January the US national debt was over trillion When Was the US National Debt the Highest Looking at national debt in terms of debttoGDP ratio the federal debt rose to an alltime high of in the second quarter of due to the pandemicfueled recession The Bottom Line The national debt is the total amount of money that a country owes to its creditors The government spends money on programs such as healthcare education and Social Security and accumulates debt by borrowing to cover the outstanding balance of expenses incurred over time Major economic and political events such as recessions wars or pandemics can affect government spending In early the US government hit the debt limit again This is the maximum amount it can borrow before the debt limit is suspended If the debt ceiling is reached and not suspended or raised by Congress the federal government could default on its debt This has never happened but if it does it could have significant ramifications for US and global markets

Wharton Budget Model,national debt,Summary PWBM estimates thateven under myopic expectationsfinancial markets cannot sustain more than the next years of accumulated deficits projected under current US fiscal policy Forwardlooking financial markets are therefore effectively betting that future fiscal policy will provide substantial corrective measures ahead of time If financial markets started to believe otherwise debt dynamics would unravel and become unsustainable much sooner Key Points The US public debt outstanding of trillion often cited by media is largely misleading as it includes trillion that the federal government owes itself due to trust fund and other accounting The economics profession has long focused on debt held by the public currently equal to about percent of GDP at trillion for assessing its effects on the economy We estimate that the US debt held by the public cannot exceed about percent of GDP even under todays generally favorable market conditions Larger ratios in countries like Japan for example are not relevant for the United States because Japan has a much larger household saving rate which morethan absorbs the larger government debt Under current policy the United States has about years for corrective action after which no amount of future tax increases or spending cuts could avoid the government defaulting on its debt whether explicitly or implicitly ie debt monetization producing significant inflation Unlike technical defaults where payments are merely delayed this default would be much larger and would reverberate across the US and world economies This time frame is the best case scenario for the United States under markets conditions where participants believe that corrective fiscal actions will happen ahead of time If instead they started to believe otherwise debt dynamics would make the time window for corrective action even shorter When Does Federal Debt Reach Unsustainable Levels Introduction This introduction to this brief is by necessity a bit more technical than found in most PWBM briefs We provide a small primer for policymakers and other readers to understand how PWBM analyzes the impact of debt on the US economy These insights generally apply to the workings of other dynamic models used by government scoring agencies As we have discussed elsewhere government debt reduces economic activity by crowding out private capital formation and by requiring future tax increases or spending cuts to accommodate future interest payments The dynamic overlappinggenerations OLG model originally based on the seminal work by Diamond and Auerbach and Kotlikoff is the workhorse framework for analyzing the impact of government debt on the economy through both tax and spending channels The Penn Wharton Budget Model PWBM and the Congressional Budget Office use versions of the OLG model largely based on the papers by Nishiyama and Smetters subsequently modified in various ways over time The Joint Committee on Taxation also has access to its own OLG model for assessing dynamics It is generally not well understood outside tight academic and DC modeling circles that these models effectively crash when trying to project future macroeconomic variables under current fiscal policy The reason is that current fiscal policy is not sustainable and forwardlooking financial markets know it leading to the economy unraveling through backward Dealing with this problem has sometimes led scoring agencies to also use additional models where financial markets follow simple adaptive backwardlooking rulesofthumb In some cases these alternative modelsin particular the standard neoclassical growth modeldo not include a role for government debt under the strong assumption of Ricardian consumers To be sure obtaining insights from alternative models can often provide meaningful information However for understanding novel debt dynamics with no historical precedent such alternative reduced form models are unsuitable and generally provide projections that are optimistically biased Instead in practice the workhorse OLG model is generally fixed by augmenting it with an additional assumptionnamely a future fiscal policy action that is not actually contained in current law This modelling fix also called closure rule springs into action at a future date to stabilize the amount of debt held by the public relative to GDP It often takes one of several alternative forms a broadbased valueadded tax VAT a proportional wage tax not subject to any payroll tax ceiling a proportional income tax a broadbased reduction in spending or some combination of each Broadbased closure rules introduce very small economic distortions relative to other alternatives such as a narrowbased progressive tax on capital income Importantly broadbased closure rules allow model sustainability with the maximum amount of debt relative to GDP before needing to be activated Both PWBM and CBO typically have this rule kick in the year or later potentially with some gradual introduction As it turns out the exact form of the broadbased closure rulefor example whether it is a VAT or some other taxis not that important in terms of economic effects What is important is that a large broadbased future corrective change in fiscal policy happens in any form to stabilize the debtGDP ratio and that such a correction action is anticipated by financial markets Otherwise forwardlooking financial markets would unravel much soonera process known as backward inductionto cause a sovereign debt crisis Existing dynamic OLG models also face a second encumbrance For reasons that go beyond this brief OLG models used in policymaking typically do not properly distinguish between riskfree assets government bonds and risky assets eg stocks That lack of distinction usually creates only a minor loss in model fidelity when analyzing the economic impact of many fiscal policies such as preK education or infrastructure The lack of distinction is more problematic at higher levels of government debt that materially change financial market prices Now we want to estimate the amount of government debt that the economy can handle while being consistent with household investment risktaking preferences and the effects of distortionary taxes and changes to productive spending Over the past several years PWBM has built a second OLG modelthe PWBM moonshot OLG modelthat solves a state space times larger than the PWBM standard OLG model referenced above While simpler in some dimensions to our standard model the moonshot model combines mathematical advances with largescale computing to solve the curse of dimensionality commonly found in quantum computing problems The moonshot model allows us to compute interactions of debt with financial markets with much greater confidence to ensure consistency with investor risk preference in more extreme boundary settings Even with a closure rule discussed above added to the moonshot model there is only so much federal debt that financial markets can handle that is at any government borrowing rate We will explore this issue in more detail in a future brief Succinctly for now the increase in debt crowds out private capital formation which lowers GDP growth and the size of tax bases This crowding out is especially pronounced in the moonshot OLG when reaching limits of the economys debt carrying capacity At the same time more tax revenue is needed to implement the closure rule that stabilizes debt relative to GDP Even when using an efficient VAT the tax distortions shrink the economy even more so that interest payments can no longer be made In effect the economy collapses under the sheer weight of government debt As of September the federal debt held by the public herein debt stood at trillion or about percent of projected GDP The public debt outstanding of trillion often cited in media is largely misleading and not relevant for assessing economic impact about trillion of that amount is from the federal government holding its own debt for accounting purposes The economics profession has long focused on debt held by the public Still even with the most favorable of assumptions for the United States PWBM estimates that a maximum debtGDP ratio of percent can be sustained even if investors believe maybe myopically that a closure rule will then prevent that ratio from increasing into the future Countries like Japan with an even larger debtGDP ratio morethan offset their government debt with a household saving rate that is much larger than that found in the United States This percent value is computed as an outer bound using various favorable assumptions a more plausible value is closer to percent and even then it assumes that financial markets believe that the government will eventually implement an efficient closure rule Once financial markets believe otherwise financial markets can unravel at smaller debtGDP ratios Government Debt Projections Have Risen Sharply Over Time Federal debt has increased consistently since the lates Figure shows the Congressional Budget Offices year projections labeled by the month and year of publication of federal debt held by the public as a share of the Gross Domestic Product GDP in percent since Each line in Figure represents a time series of numbers In each the first value shows actual debtGDP ratio at the end of the year before the year of publication The second value shows debt held by the public expected as of the end of the current calendar year and the following values are CBOs projection of debtGDP ratio at the end of each year during the next decade Figure CBO year Projections of Debt Held by the Public as a Share of GDP fiscal years percent DOWNLOAD DATA Some of the increase in debt is well understood and driven by policy changes including in response to Great Recession the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of and more recent Covid stimulus Some of the projected debt increase was due to underestimates in entitlement program spending arising from fasterthanexpected growth in the population of retirees and their Social Security and Medicare benefits A decomposition of the exact causes goes beyond this brief What Figure clearly documents however is the secular rise in the debtGDP ratio relative to past projections rather than an upanddown relationship consistent with countercyclical policy Put differently US debt is on secular upward path and past projections have if anything underestimated that increase regardless of the reason How Long Does the United States Have Financial markets demand a higher interest rate to purchase government debt as the supply of that debt increases controlling for other macroeconomic shocks that might simultaneously increase the demand for debt Forwardlooking financial markets should demand an even higher return if they see debt increasing well into the future Those higher borrowing rates in turn make debt grow even faster snowball potentially producing a downward spiral in the price that the government can sell debt in exchange for a promise of a fixed set of future payments Modeling this behavior can often become circular with key drivers such as closure rules lacking transparency In this brief we take a more cautious and transparent approach leaving presentation of our more sophisticated analyses to future briefs Toward this end Table uses the PWBM microsimulation model to project future debtGDP ratios at different levels of interest rates without explicit debt feedback effects on interest rates For the PWBM Baseline rate we use future interest rates that are currently used by the Social Security Administration their medium cost projection for estimating future trust fund balances These real interest rates start at around percent today and gradually increase to percent by the th year where they remain steady thereafter The rate at the th year is currently smaller than the year real interest rate as of October In contrast CBO assumes CBO real rate that increases from percent today to in years and then keeps rising to percent by We present values based on their numbers in the Appendix Importantly in theory the SSA interest rate projections are not intended to include the impact from historically unprecedented mounting future government debt itself Candidly however at this point some arguments about debt and future rates become circular in modeling discussions However both authors are experts in SSA estimation methodswith one of the authors currently serving on the Social Security Advisory Board and the other author serving on its most recent technical panel The larger SSA rate is mostly guided by historical averages rather than forwardlooking estimates that incorporate future debt Indeed SSA generally does not attempt to incorporate federal debt into its own forecasts even though this debt can erode the size of the payroll tax base that supports benefits We will return to this topic in another brief Table then shows the impact on the debtGDP ratio if financial markets start to demand a larger return before unraveling equal to an

debt,In the late th century Alexander Hamilton wrote A national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing A nice idea in theory but Americas governments since then havent quite stuck to the plan Instead the US economy is resting atop a public debt exceeding trillion with its debttoGDP ratio sitting at around Perhaps not the blessing the Founding Fathers had once envisioned Now alarm bells are beginning to ring with increasing frequency and volume Jamie Dimon says Washington is facing a global market rebellion because of the tab it is racking up while Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan believes its time to stop admiring the problem and instead do something about it Elsewhere The Black Swan author Nassim Taleb says the economy is in a death spiral while Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says its past time to have an adult conversation about fiscal responsibility And despite the issue being the most predictable crisis weve ever had according to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryana summary Dimon agrees withits an item that isnt yet top of the political agenda Its also worth noting this isnt the job of one party or the other to fix This debt has been accumulated courtesy of spending by both Republicans and Democrats The list of presidents who added the most debt by percentage begins with FDR Dem followed by Woodrow Wilson Dem and Ronald Reagan Rep Whoevers shoulders it falls on to address its clear the public now wants action Last year Pew Research found that reducing government debt was a key concern for of the people surveyedup from just a year prior But do individualswho currently have a sum of more than dangling over their heads when debt is divided per capitaneed to be so concerned about the issue How will it impact their purse strings their living costs and their savings plans How big is the threat It depends on who you ask If its the Peter G Peterson Foundation youre talking to the issue is pretty sizable The New Yorkbased nonpartisan organization dedicates itself to raising public awareness around fiscal challenges with the increasing government debt being one of its top concerns The group believes debt could lead to reduced public spending private investors losing faith in Americas economy a shrinking window of prosperity for US families thanks to worsening housing and job markets and a threat to national security Laura Veldkamp a professor of finance at Columbia University has a less catastrophic view She encourages the public to use realworld comparisons to understand the context around the headlinegrabbing figures Professor Veldkamp explained to Fortune If the US were a household we might measure its debt by the debttoincome ratio The debt is about times the national income GDP The payment each year for federal debt interest is around of the debt This means the US government needs to pay about of GDP in interest expenses Federal tax income is around of GDP So the debt payments are less than onethird of the income If this were a household or firm we wouldnt call that highly indebted The far more difficult issue is whether or not this debt is being accumulated responsibly and will result in a positive return in the future This is where JPMorgan boss Dimon gets concerned In a slowing economy can the government expect to see an uptick in output to offset the investment Instead of focusing on the level of debt we should be asking What is the return on the investment professor Veldkamp added If the government is issuing debt to invest in highreturn projects then debt is good If it is not then the debt will be tough to pay off because of low future productivity And in The Deficit Myth Stephanie Kelton professor of economics at Stony Brook University points out that public debt in the past has made economies more equitable and prosperous but that scary words like deficit quell societies into not pushing fiscal support far enough for it to truly pay off on a large scale While professor Keltons belief is a far cry from the doomsday opinions of some she doesnt advocate for limitless spending without cause or future societal payoff either as investing in areas of the economy that are already working well merely results in inflation Could the housing market be impacted Housing construction cars and any other interestratesensitive sectors will be disproportionately impacted by an attempt to rebalance public debt William G Gale of the Brookings Institution told Fortune Higher government debt will tend to raise interest rates the author of Fiscal Therapy Curing Americas Addiction to Debt and Investing in the Future said If government creates debt it has to be financed somehowtaxes or money creation If debt gets out of hand money creation historically has been the false solution as it is easier to issue money than raise taxes but often more disastrous in the long term Any rise in interest rates will shock younger generations coming up the housing ladder over the next few decades While many economists point out the controversial Fed rate hikes of the s are merely normalizing the rates of many eras before homeowners and prospective buyers have grown accustomed to a federal base rate of effectively less than Beyond having negative psychological impacts rising rates are also bad news for the already unattainable market According to the latest National Association of Realtors index the median family income is while the median amount needed to qualify to buy a home is Will public debt impact Americas national security This is a longheld fear from experts in the field More than a decade ago when national debt sat at a measly trillion Americas former joint chiefs of staff chairman Admiral Michael Mullen said debt was the top threat to national security Fourteen years on former Speaker Ryan told the Bipartisan Policy Center in January that before long the government will be spending more on servicing its debt than it is on investing in the Pentagon Dimon added This is about the security of the world We need a stronger military we need a stronger America We need it now So I put this as a risky thing for all of us Couldnt the government just keep spending If the government has racked up this level of debt and the economy is still survivingafter all inflation is down jobs are steady consumers are in decent shapesome might question why politicians cant keep spending seemingly without confidence There are a couple of issues with that The first is wellknown The government has a selfimposed debt ceiling which it cannot spend above and it needs congressional approval to raise or extend it This is a fairly regular occurrenceits happened separate times since However negotiations reached the eleventh hour last summer when Republicans pushed hard for promises from President Bidens government to rein in spending When the issue comes around again just after the election a deal may be more difficult The other issue is that at some point investors may no longer want to buy government debt if they fear the US wont be able to pay it back Thats a primary concern for Joao Gomes senior vice dean of research and professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School The most important thing about debt to me for people to keep in mind is you need somebody to buy it Gomes told Fortune We used to be able to count on China Japanese investors the Fed to buy the debt All those players are slowly going away and are actually now selling Americas ability to pay its debts is a concern for the nations around the world that own a trillion chunk of the funds The nations most exposed are Japan which owned trillion as of November China billion the UK billion Luxembourg billion and Canada billion If at some moment these folks that have so far been happy to buy government debt from major economies decide You know what Im not too sure if this is a good investment anymore Im going to ask for a higher interest rate to be persuaded to hold this then we could have a real accident on our hands Gomes said He added The moment the government in any country realizes that it cannot sell trillion in annual debt anymore you will have to impose major cuts on some programs That opens a Pandoras box of social unrest that I dont think anybody wants to think about,Jamie Dimon Brian Moynihan and Jerome Powell are worrying about national debt should you Fortune In the late th century Alexander Hamilton wrote A national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing A nice idea in theory but Americas governments since then havent quite stuck to the plan Instead the US economy is resting atop a public debt exceeding trillion with its debttoGDP ratio sitting at around Perhaps not the blessing the Founding Fathers had once envisioned Now alarm bells are beginning to ring with increasing frequency and volume Jamie Dimon says Washington is facing a global market rebellion because of the tab it is racking up while Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan believes its time to stop admiring the problem and instead do something about it Elsewhere The Black Swan author Nassim Taleb says the economy is in a death spiral while Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says its past time to have an adult conversation about fiscal responsibility And despite the issue being the most predictable crisis weve ever had according to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryana summary Dimon agrees withits an item that isnt yet top of the political agenda Its also worth noting this isnt the job of one party or the other to fix This debt has been accumulated courtesy of spending by both Republicans and Democrats The list of presidents who added the most debt by percentage begins with FDR Dem followed by Woodrow Wilson Dem and Ronald Reagan Rep Whoevers shoulders it falls on to address its clear the public now wants action Last year Pew Research found that reducing government debt was a key concern for of the people surveyedup from just a year prior But do individualswho currently have a sum of more than dangling over their heads when debt is divided per capitaneed to be so concerned about the issue How will it impact their purse strings their living costs and their savings plans How big is the threat It depends on who you ask If its the Peter G Peterson Foundation youre talking to the issue is pretty sizable The New Yorkbased nonpartisan organization dedicates itself to raising public awareness around fiscal challenges with the increasing government debt being one of its top concerns The group believes debt could lead to reduced public spending private investors losing faith in Americas economy a shrinking window of prosperity for US families thanks to worsening housing and job markets and a threat to national security Laura Veldkamp a professor of finance at Columbia University has a less catastrophic view She encourages the public to use realworld comparisons to understand the context around the headlinegrabbing figures Professor Veldkamp explained to Fortune If the US were a household we might measure its debt by the debttoincome ratio The debt is about times the national income GDP The payment each year for federal debt interest is around of the debt This means the US government needs to pay about of GDP in interest expenses Federal tax income is around of GDP So the debt payments are less than onethird of the income If this were a household or firm we wouldnt call that highly indebted The far more difficult issue is whether or not this debt is being accumulated responsibly and will result in a positive return in the future This is where JPMorgan boss Dimon gets concerned In a slowing economy can the government expect to see an uptick in output to offset the investment Instead of focusing on the level of debt we should be asking What is the return on the investment professor Veldkamp added If the government is issuing debt to invest in highreturn projects then debt is good If it is not then the debt will be tough to pay off because of low future productivity And in The Deficit Myth Stephanie Kelton professor of economics at Stony Brook University points out that public debt in the past has made economies more equitable and prosperous but that scary words like deficit quell societies into not pushing fiscal support far enough for it to truly pay off on a large scale While professor Keltons belief is a far cry from the doomsday opinions of some she doesnt advocate for limitless spending without cause or future societal payoff either as investing in areas of the economy that are already working well merely results in inflation Could the housing market be impacted Housing construction cars and any other interestratesensitive sectors will be disproportionately impacted by an attempt to rebalance public debt William G Gale of the Brookings Institution told Fortune Higher government debt will tend to raise interest rates the author of Fiscal Therapy Curing Americas Addiction to Debt and Investing in the Future said If government creates debt it has to be financed somehowtaxes or money creation If debt gets out of hand money creation historically has been the false solution as it is easier to issue money than raise taxes but often more disastrous in the long term Any rise in interest rates will shock younger generations coming up the housing ladder over the next few decades While many economists point out the controversial Fed rate hikes of the s are merely normalizing the rates of many eras before homeowners and prospective buyers have grown accustomed to a federal base rate of effectively less than Beyond having negative psychological impacts rising rates are also bad news for the already unattainable market According to the latest National Association of Realtors index the median family income is while the median amount needed to qualify to buy a home is Will public debt impact Americas national security This is a longheld fear from experts in the field More than a decade ago when national debt sat at a measly trillion Americas former joint chiefs of staff chairman Admiral Michael Mullen said debt was the top threat to national security Fourteen years on former Speaker Ryan told the Bipartisan Policy Center in January that before long the government will be spending more on servicing its debt than it is on investing in the Pentagon Dimon added This is about the security of the world We need a stronger military we need a stronger America We need it now So

been added since the end of the fiscal year and it took years for the debt to reach that same number One point right off the bat The fiscal year ended in September which means the numbers include the last few months of former President Donald Trumps time in office Overall Hovde is pretty close on the actual numbers said Menzie Chinn a public affairs and economics professor at the University of

Foundation,national debt,The most recent projections from the Congressional Budget Office CBO confirm once again that Americas fiscal outlook is on an unsustainable path increasingly driven by higher interest costs Growing debt in addition to the rise in interest rates over the past couple of years has significantly increased the cost of federal borrowing In interest costs on the national debt totaled billion surpassing most other components of the federal budget CBO projects that interest costs in will total billion a jump of percent from the previous year and following increases of and percent in each of the two years before that This years high interest bill isnt a oneyear phenomenon its part of a trend that stretches out into the future as debt continues to climb and relatively high interest rates push up the cost of federal borrowing Over the next decade the US governments interest payments on the national debt are now projected to total trillion the highest dollar amount for interest in any historical year period and more than double the total spent in the past two decades In fact by pretty much any measurement interest on the national debt will soon grow beyond its highest level since when such data were first collected Adjusting for inflation to dollars net interest costs under CBOs projections which generally assume that current laws remain the same would rise from billion in to nearly trillion in Outside of the past couple of years the previous inflationadjusted high was billion in Relative to the size of the economy interest costs would reach percent of gross domestic product GDP in eclipsing the previous high set in Interest costs would climb to percent of GDP by As a share of federal revenues federal interest payments would rise to percent by exceeding the previous high of percent set in They would continue climbing to percent by As a percent of total spending interest costs would reach percent by eclipsing the previous high of percent set in Download as PDF Another way to contextualize the growth in interest costs right now the Treasury pays about billion per day on average for interest And unless we change course that will rise to billion per day in Mounting interest costs put tremendous pressure on the federal budget making it more difficult and costly to address pressing challenges and invest for the future In fact under CBOs projections net interest costs will eventually become the largest program in the federal budget exceeding Medicare in and Social Security in Rising interest costs also contribute to a vicious cycle of higher debt and additional interest costs Any number in the trillions can be hard to grasp Here are some ways to consider what trillion in interest means for America trillion is Roughly per person About twice what the government spent on net interest between and Nearly four times Social Securitys cumulative cash deficits in the next years About twice the cost of the federal response to COVID Nearly five times the cost of the US weather and climate disasters that exceeded billion since adjusted for inflation About times the billion need for Americas drinking water infrastructure over the next years By any measure interest costs as part of the federal budget are at an alltime high and trending even higher in the years ahead Securing our nations fiscal and economic future will mean getting these interest costs under control which will help relieve pressure within the budget allow us to invest in more forwardlooking priorities for our future respond to emergencies and help ensure

interest costs on the national debt totaled billion surpassing most other components of the federal budget CBO projects that interest costs in will total billion a jump of percent from the previous year and following increases of and percent in each of the two years before that This years high interest bill isnt a oneyear phenomenon its part of a trend that stretches out into the future as debt continues to climb and relatively high interest rates push up the cost of federal borrowing Over the next decade the US governments interest payments on the national debt are now projected to total trillion the highest dollar amount for interest in any historical year period and more than double the total spent in the past two decades In fact by pretty much any measurement interest on the national debt will soon grow beyond its highest level since when such data were first collected Adjusting for inflation to dollars net interest costs under CBOs projections which generally assume that current laws remain the same would rise from billion in to nearly trillion in Outside of the past couple of years the previous inflationadjusted high was billion in Relative to the size of the economy interest costs would reach percent of gross domestic product GDP in eclipsing the previous high set in Interest costs would climb to percent of GDP by As a share of federal revenues federal interest payments would rise to percent by exceeding the previous high of percent set in They would continue climbing to percent by As a percent of total spending interest costs would reach percent by eclipsing the previous high of percent set in Download as PDF Another way to contextualize the growth in interest costs right now the Treasury pays about billion per day on average for interest And unless we change course that will rise to billion per day in Mounting interest costs put tremendous pressure on the federal budget making it more difficult and costly to address pressing challenges and invest for the future In fact under CBOs projections net interest costs will eventually become the largest program in the federal budget exceeding Medicare in and Social Security in Rising interest costs also contribute to a vicious cycle of higher debt and additional interest costs Any number in the trillions can be hard to grasp Here are some ways to consider what trillion in interest means for America trillion is Roughly per person About twice what the government spent on net interest between and Nearly four times Social Securitys cumulative cash deficits in the next years About twice the cost of the federal response to COVID Nearly five times the cost of the US weather and climate disasters that exceeded billion since adjusted for inflation About times the billion need for Americas drinking water infrastructure over the next years By any measure interest costs as part of the federal budget are at an alltime high and trending even higher in the years ahead Securing our nations fiscal and economic future will mean getting these interest costs under control which will help relieve pressure within the budget allow us to invest in more forwardlooking priorities for our future respond to emergencies and help ensure a vibrant and inclusive economy for our nation Related CBOs Projections Indicate Our Fiscal Trajectory Remains Unsustainable Image credit Kent Nishimura

What Lessons Can Be Drawn from Japan's High Debt-to-GDP Ratio? - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,What Lessons Can Be Drawn from Japan's High Debt-to-GDP Ratio?

Reserve Bank of St. Louis,national debt,The US national debt reached trillion in the second quarter of which is approximately of US gross domestic product GDP On its own trillion is a large number but is a debttoGDP ratio of also considered high According to historical data the answer is yes Twenty years ago the US debt ratio was only of GDP Looking further back in time the previous high was in following the heavy expenses associated with World War II Additionally the Congressional Budget Office has projected that if current laws remain unchanged the US will continue to run a large primary deficit at over of GDP annually until Under this scenario the US will need to steadily increase its debt level to finance its deficit Given that the CBO is currently forecasting the economy to grow less than annually through this means that the debttoGDP ratio will keep growing as well Under this forecast it seems unlikely that the US will begin running a fiscal surplus anytime soon Given this high level of national debt paired with the uncertainty of a future government surplus there is concern regarding the United States ability to sustain its public debt Looking at Japans Debt Burden Some economists have turned to Japan as an example to address this concern Why For more than two decades Japans national debt has floated above of its GDP In fact as of the second quarter of Japans debttoGDP ratio was In other words Japan has been able to maintain a very high level of debt for decades Researchers have also pointed out similarities in the fiscal problems faced by the US today and Japan years ago Due to Japans rapidly aging population economists predicted that the heavy burden of social security expenses would result in a large fiscal deficit which could then lead to a public debt crisis However a crisis has yet to occur When examining Japans debttoGDP it may therefore seem fair to assume that concerns regarding the USs high level of debt are overstated In this blog post we show that while simple a comparison based solely on the debttoGDP ratio overlooks several other key factors A more comprehensive view of the debt issue necessitates an examination of the public sectors balance sheet as a whole the level of net liability and the revenue from its asset returns Consolidated Balance Sheets Explained We must look outside the federal governments level of national debt for a few reasons First the governments liability position may be more than its level of public debt For example the government may also have other types of borrowing from the private sector or hold unfunded pension obligations to government retirees Secondly any operating surpluses or deficits sustained by independent government agencies such as the Social Security Administration will eventually be felt by the general public So arguably there is no reason to focus solely on the liabilities and assets of the executive departments of the federal government ignoring all other public institutions In some countries these public institutions likely hold a sizeable asset position in the form of social security funds or sovereign wealth funds As we will discuss Japans social security fund is quite largearound of GDP in the second quarter of In short it is important to look at the public sector as a whole given that its overall level of assets indicates the countrys ability to offset any outstanding liabilities including debts Looking at the Numbers for Japan and the US The tables below report the consolidated balance sheets of Japans and the United States public sectors for the third quarter of Japans Consolidated Public Sector Balance Sheet as a Percentage of GDP Third Quarter of Assets Currency and Deposits Domestic Loans Domestic Equities Foreign Securities Other Domestic Securities Sum Liabilities Bank Reserves Currency Government Bonds Loans Sum Net Liability SOURCE Japan Flow of Funds NOTE The numbers may not add up because of rounding US Consolidated Public Sector Balance Sheet as a Percentage of GDP Third Quarter of Assets Currency and Deposits Domestic Loans Others Sum Liabilities Bank Reserves and Repo Claims of Pension Fund on Sponsor Currency and Deposits Government Bonds Others Sum Net Liability SOURCE US Financial Accounts NOTE Most of domestic loans are student loans provided by the federal government The claims of pension fund on sponsor category refers to the amount of underfunding in defined benefit pension plans to government workers Notice that for Japan the net debttoGDP ratio government bondstoGDP ratio found in the consolidated balance sheet is only which is much smaller than the debttoGDP ratio reported earlier in the second quarter of This is a direct result of intragovernmental holdings which refers to public debts that are owned by its own agencies such as the social security fund and the central bank For example the Bank of Japans holdings of Japanese government debt is equivalent to around of GDP For the same reason the United States net debttoGDP ratio is also lower only in the consolidated balance sheet On a consolidated balance sheet intragovernmental holdings will appear on both the asset and liability sides and hence they cancel each other out For example in the US the Social Security trust funds and the Federal Reserve System both hold a significant amount of assets in the form of US Treasuries These holdings contribute to the reduction of the debttoGDP ratio shown in the consolidated balance sheet Additionally the first table illustrates the Japanese governments large asset position Again this is in large part a result of that countrys sizable social security fund which is equal to of GDP A lower level of net liabilities defined as liabilities minus assets is indicative of a strong fiscal situation The Japanese public sectors liabilitiescurrency bank reserves and government bondsare of GDP which is quite high However the consolidated balance sheet shows a large number of assets which represent of GDP Thus Japans resulting net liability position is only As for the US with a liability position totaling and a much smaller asset position of GDP the countrys net liability position is similar to that of Japans Considering the Debt Servicing Burden The final key aspect is the revenue from returns on the assets and liabilities held by each countrys public sector There is a large return gap between assets and liabilities on Japans consolidated balance sheet Due to Japans low interest rate policies the returns on bank reserves and government bonds are essentially zero which suggests that the interest burden on the countrys debt is not heavy Meanwhile Japan maintains a risky asset position with many domestic equities of GDP and foreign bonds and equities of GDP and therefore the returns are quite high Essentially the Japanese governments strategy is to borrow at an extremely cheap rate and invest in risky highreturn assetsa factor that partially explains why Japan can sustain a high level of debt despite running a consistent deficit Why the US Situation Is Different However this is not the story for the United States In fact the return difference on the US public sector balance sheet is small meaning the US government borrows at a rate that is close to its average asset return In short as a way of supporting the large deficit caused by the aging population Japans strategy involves a concept called financial repression meaning the government uses regulatory methods to borrow cheaply and widen the returns gap on their balance sheet For this to hold some economic agent must be willing or forced to lend to the government cheaply In this case the economic agent is Japanese households When Japanese householdswho hold a large amount of lowreturn demand depositsdeposit their savings into banks the banks can then lend cheaply to other domestic borrowers such as the government However this is not the case in the US where households largest portfolio share is equity Therefore opportunities for a cheap funding source are much more limited for the US Given differences in the level of net liability and in the revenue from returns between the US and Japan the aggressive fiscal and monetary policies adopted by Japan may not be appropriate or even feasible for the United States Thus we should not rely on the

the national debt rising from of gross domestic product GDP in to of GDP in That level of debt held by the public is nearly three times the to average of of GDP It would also far surpass the current record high of of GDP which was set in when the US was in the process of demobilization after the conclusion of World War II The CBO projects the debt held by the public will break that record in

from of gross domestic product GDP in to of GDP in That level of debt held by the public is nearly three times the to average of of GDP It would also far surpass the current record high of of GDP which was set in when the US was in the process of demobilization after the conclusion of World War II The CBO projects the debt held by the public will break that record in reaching of GDP Annual

payments on its debt than it does on national defense That state of the countrys fiscal house and how its likely affecting the Federal Reserves interest rate decisions was a central theme at the SIEPR

are posing some unique challenges and our countrys politics are arguably more polarized than ever The price of political gridlock The session explored what could be done to ward off a fullblown fiscal crisis The biggest threat experts say is if investors no longer think of the US as a safe haven for their money If that happens the country would no longer be able to borrow to pay off its debts and other obligations We totally know how to fix this but the problem is the lack of political will says Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget When could that tipping point come asked Greg Ip the The Wall Street Journals chief economics commentator who facilitated the conversation As the ratio of US debt to GDP has continued to climb many experts thought it would have

totally know how to fix this said Maya MacGuineas the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget She was joined on the panel by Phillip Swagel director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and William Gale a prominent economist at the Brookings Institution The problem MacGuineas said boils down to the lack of political will to make hard choices around cutting spending andor raising taxes People just have politicians telling them they can have it all and not pay for it she said And like a homework deadline the longer we wait to get it done the more difficult the assignment gets and the more unpleasant it gets Swagel said Possible solutions The speakers didnt lack ideas for how to repair the countrys broken finances MacGuineas and Ip for example

according to the United States Department of Treasury Paying off the US federal debt will prove to be a longterm challenge that could have a significant impact on the job market For example a default on the US debt could lead to substantial job losses potentially affecting millions of workers In White House economists warned that a protracted default scenario could eradicate million jobs from the US economy Without the ability to spend on countercyclical measures such as extended unemployment insurance Federal and state governments would be hamstrung in responding to this turmoil and unable to buffer households from the impacts the Council of Economic Advisers reported in a White House blog post Neither would households be able to borrow through the private sector as the interest rates on the financial instruments that households and businesses useTreasury bonds mortgages and credit card interest rateswould skyrocket due to risks of an uncertain future the CEA added The relationship between the US national debt and the job market is influenced by a number of factors High debt levels lead to higher interest rates making it more expensive for businesses to borrow money for expansion and investment which can potentially slow down job creation To reduce the debt the federal government will need to implement spending cuts or tax increases These actions impact government programs and consumer spending leading to job losses in certain sectors Additionally a high debt burden can create uncertainty and undermine investor confidence adversely impacting economic growth and hiring Government spending financed by debt stimulates the economy and job growth in the short term particularly in public sectors and industries receiving government contracts which is evident in recent US jobs reports A high national debt could raise the likelihood of a financial crisis which would spark job losses and economic instability Some economists fear that continued growth of the national debt could undermine US global leadership by leaving fewer resources for military diplomatic and humanitarian operations which could indirectly affect the job market According to Moodys Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi a US debt default could wipe out trillion in household wealth Addressing the US federal debt and its impact on the job market requires comprehensive policy measures economic reforms and strategic planning It is critical to consider the potential consequences of high levels of debt on job creation labor market dynamics and Americans financial wellbeing Some suggest despite strong opposition that opening the US borders would help A study coauthored by an MIT economist found that immigrants are more likely to start a business than nativeborn US citizens which would serve to benefit the economy and job market Proponents of this solution say that by opening the borders future entrepreneurs from all over the world would help fuel the business creation that results in higher tax revenue that is desperately needed to reduce the national debt A fastergrowing population due to immigration could also create more demand for everything from housing to cars This may result in a stronger economy that can help pay down the debt Also having more individual wage earners would help finance Social Security and other social programs for decades to come according to analysis from the Cato Institute Another controversial solution that will surely make people unhappy is to raise the retirement age Making the full amount of Social Security retirement benefits available to Americans in their s instead of their s could help reduce the national debt since it increases the amount that people pay into Social Security and reduces the time that they rely on payments from the program Paying off the debt completely would require significant sacrifices or economic measures Reducing government spending across various programs could free up resources for debt repayment Raising taxes could generate additional revenue for debt repayment However this would be politically divisive and impact different income groups unevenly Extending debt maturities or negotiating lower interest rates with creditors would reduce the immediate burden A combination of measures like balanced spending cuts strategic tax adjustments and economic growth strategies might be more sustainable and politically viable Completely eliminating the debt might not be the sole objective Aiming for sustainable debt levels that ensure fiscal responsibility and
