Then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything.

At the start of Donald Trump’s presidency in January 2017, the economy was healthy.

Employers had added jobs for 76 months straight — the longest hiring streak on record at the time — and unemployment was just 4.7%, a 10-year low. Corporate profits were near all-time highs, and so were stocks. Overall, gross domestic product was growing around 2.5% a year — a modest rate for the world’s largest economy. Not everything was rosy: the federal debt was at its highest level since the 1950s. But by most metrics, it was hard to deny: the economy was on solid footing. And fortunately for Trump, the growth continued from there.

Then came the pandemic.

Below, we’ve tracked 10 indicators to show how the economy evolved under each president from Ronald Reagan to Trump. Keep in mind, each presidency started under different circumstances. George W. Bush’s first year in office was plagued by the dot-com bust and the September 11th attacks. Barack Obama’s started with the Great Recession, following a devastating housing crash and a global financial crisis. Despite these crises, however, most recent presidents have presided over a growing economy during their time in office. The Trump presidency will be characterized by the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which is still playing out both as a health crisis and an economic one.

Hover over the charts to see how the economy under Trump compares with how it evolved under his predecessors.

Jobs Big losses

Up until 2020, President Trump’s first term was characterized by solid job growth, but then the pandemic wiped out about 15% of American jobs in just two months. Since May, the economy has recovered only about half those jobs, and Trump is heading into the election with the worst job losses on record under any president.

In contrast, at this point in Obama’s presidency, the job market was up 0.4%. He took office at a time when employers were cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. Hiring kicked into higher gear later in his presidency.

Unemployment A big rise

By the time Trump entered office, he had inherited one of the strongest job markets in American history from Obama. But Covid-19 swiftly put an end to that. The unemployment rate shot to 14.7%, up 10 percentage points from when Trump took office. Although it has improved slightly since then, unemployment still remained elevated in September. No other president has encountered such a sudden spike in joblessness.

Median income Big gains (Data until 2019)

Trump loves to talk about how middle class incomes have increased during his presidency — and that was true in his first three years. In September, the Census Bureau released data showing that the median American household earned $68,703 in 2019 — up $5,800 or 9% from 2016, after adjusting for inflation. A strong job market helped lift incomes, as more people worked full-time, year-round. And more than 20 states also raised their minimum wage, boosting earnings for low-income workers.

We don’t have data for 2020 yet, but the pandemic will surely impact those numbers in a big way. For some families, $1,200 stimulus checks and a temporary $600 boost in weekly unemployment benefits actually lifted incomes during the pandemic. But many others, especially those who have lost businesses or are grappling with long-term joblessness, are struggling to make ends meet.

S&P 500 Big gains

The longest bull market in history began shortly after Obama entered office and continued well into Trump’s presidency. Investors welcomed Trump’s corporate tax cuts in 2017, and although the trade war with China put them on edge, stocks enjoyed a record-breaking run all the way up to 2020. At the start of the pandemic in 2020, the S&P 500 plunged 34% in about a month, before recovering later in the summer. As of October 28, the index was up 44% in Trump’s presidency, overall. While that quick bounce-back is a bright spot for him, it also contrasts with 75% stock gains under Obama and 63% gains under Clinton at the same point in their presidencies.

Home prices Big gains

The housing market is one of the few parts of the economy that hasn’t dramatically declined during the pandemic. That’s in part because record-low interest rates and the work-from-home trend have led city dwellers to buy homes in suburban and rural areas, boosting home prices in many regions. It’s also because extensive measures, including a moratorium on evictions and forbearance programs for mortgages, have helped struggling families weather the crisis so far. Those unpaid bills could eventually catch up to millions of families, causing distress in the housing market. But so far, home prices are up 21% since Trump’s inauguration.

Food prices Small increases

If it feels like your grocery bill is higher lately, that’s because food prices did surge suddenly during the pandemic. Over the longer haul, however, they’ve been relatively stable. At this same point in the presidencies of Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton and George W. Bush, food prices were already up 9% or more. They’re up only 6.1% under Trump, and were up 5.9% under Obama, reflecting an era of low inflation.

Consumer spending Up, but underperforming

American consumers are the backbone of the US economy and are not easily fazed. Although consumers sharply cut back on spending at the start of the pandemic, they were quick to reopen their wallets in May and June once stimulus checks and unemployment benefits came to their aid. Retail spending on goods, particularly through online retailers, rebounded swiftly. (Meanwhile, spending on services like haircuts, travel and dining out at restaurants remains well below pre-Covid-19 norms.) Even with a quick recovery, though, consumer spending has grown less under Trump than under any of the prior five presidents.

Manufacturing jobs Barely changed

American manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979, and no president other than Clinton has presided over gains in factory jobs since then. So when Trump promised to bring back factory jobs, it was a tall order. In Trump’s first three years, the manufacturing sector did add some jobs, but in 2020, the pandemic ruined what little progress those workers had enjoyed. As of September, the sector was down 164,000 jobs, or 1.3% from when Trump took office. That said, layoffs at factories were even steeper under Presidents Reagan, Obama and the Bushes, as globalization and technological progress reduced America’s manufacturing workforce.

Debt-to-GDP A big rise

The federal government’s debt burden hasn’t been this high relative to the size of the economy since World War II, but it didn’t get there during Trump’s presidency alone. The debt grew under Reagan, who ushered in massive tax cuts, and it surged under Obama, who used federal stimulus funds to aid the economy during the Great Recession.

At the time Trump took office, the debt totaled around 76% of GDP. But by mid 2020, it was 105% – a 29 percentage-point increase during his presidency. Economists often argue for paying down the debt when the economy is strong, and spending more when the economy is weak. But despite his promises to “get rid of” the debt, Trump has grown it in both good times and bad. While much of that increase came from coronavirus relief funds, earlier policies like corporate tax cuts and an increase in defense spending also fueled the rise.

Gross domestic product A deep recession

The widest measure of economic activity — gross domestic product — measures the value of the goods and services produced in the country. It typically grows between 2% to 3% per year after adjusting for inflation. Trump’s first three years were all within that range, but 2020 saw a deep decline. We don’t have a full year of data yet, but the second quarter was the worst in records going back to 1947. Third-quarter data, which was released on Thursday, showed a partial recovery.

Many economists predict businesses and workers will not fully bounce back from this severe economic downturn for years.

Story Highlights Americans' economic confidence now among lowest for recent election years

Still, few cite the economy as ""most important problem""

Trump's job rating on the economy down sharply, but remains solid

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' views of the U.S. economy and how President Donald Trump is handling it offer both positive and negative signals regarding Trump's reelection. Even the positive signals, however, have grown weaker since the pandemic began.

In January, Americans were mostly positive about U.S. economic conditions, a record few cited the economy as the nation's top problem and a solid majority approved of Trump's handling of the economy. Today, Americans' views have turned negative, they are more likely to name the economy as the top problem and Trump's job approval rating on the issue has dropped below 50%.

Ratings of the U.S. Economy and President Donald Trump in 2020 Selected trend Jan 2-15 , 2020 May 28-Jun 5, 2020 Gallup Economic Confidence Index (ECI) +40 -21 Economy/Jobs/Inflation named ""most important problem"" 3% 13% Approval of Trump on the economy ^ 63% 47% ^ Trump approval on the economy is from a Jan. 16-29, 2020, poll. Gallup

So what do these diminished economic ratings suggest for Trump's reelection? In short, they put him in a gray zone between presidents who have won a second term with better ratings on one or more economic measures than Trump has now (Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan) and those who have lost their reelection bid, with the public expressing much more concern about the economy than they do today (George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford).

Here are more details on the historical context in which to interpret these indicators as the rest of 2020 unfolds.

Presidential Job Approval on the Economy

Trump started 2020 with the highest economic approval rating in an election year of any president seeking reelection since Gallup began measuring economic approval in the current approve/disapprove format during Reagan's presidency.

Trump's 63% approval rating on the economy in January slipped to 58% in February, matching Clinton's prior record high in October 1996, just before he won reelection in a landslide. Trump's rating has fallen to 47% in Gallup's May 28-June 5 poll.

While below 50%, Trump approval on the economy is still on par with the October ratings earned by Obama (45% in 2012) and George W. Bush (46% in 2004) before each won reelection. It is well above the 18% approval George H.W. Bush received in 1992, shortly before he lost his bid for a second term.

Given the wide gap between Bush's 18% economic approval rating before the 1992 election and the 45% seen for Obama in 2012, it is not clear what the minimum economic approval rating needed for reelection might be. However, if Trump's rating approaches either end of the 18% to 45% range closer to the election, that could indicate whether the economy is more of an asset or a liability to his campaign.

Trump's overall job approval rating will likely remain the more important indicator of his reelection chances. His 39% job approval in Gallup's latest polling is a long way from the safety zone near 50% associated with past presidents who prevailed.

Economic Confidence

The Gallup Economic Confidence Index (ECI) is a summary of Americans' ratings of current economic conditions and their outlook for the economy. The index is the average of net positive responses to the current conditions question ((""excellent"" plus ""good"") minus ""poor"") and net positive responses to the outlook question (""getting better"" minus ""getting worse""), and has a theoretical range of -100 to +100.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans' rating of the economy as measured by the ECI went from strongly positive in January (+40) to decidedly negative in the first half of April (-32). It has since improved slightly to -21 in June.

January's +40 ECI score is roughly tied with the +41 in February as the highest Gallup has recorded in any presidential election year with an incumbent since 1992. By contrast, today's -21 score is among the lowest, significantly below the readings of -1 or higher seen at the end of 2012, 2004 and 1996, when the incumbent presidents prevailed.

Today's ECI score is not as low as the -37 recorded at the end of the 1992 campaign -- the only available election year in the trend for this metric when the incumbent lost.

The large gap between economic confidence in 2012 (when Obama won) and 1992 (when Bush lost) makes it difficult to pinpoint the level at which economic confidence becomes a significant liability for the president. It's also important to note that there is time for economic confidence to improve before the election, as it did for Obama and Clinton. If Trump sees a similar degree of improvement between now and the election, economic confidence would be more on par with the levels for presidents who won reelection.

The Economy as Most Important Problem

Gallup's historical ""most important problem"" question, originating in 1939, provides a much longer trend line on Americans' concerns about the economy during presidential election years than the Economic Confidence Index.

The combined 3% of Americans naming the economy, jobs or inflation as the nation's top problem in January was a record low for a presidential reelection year. While the figure has increased to 13% in June, this remains on the low side of the range from 7% to 79% seen in all other reelection years since 1964.

In the final pre-election readings of the most important problem from 1964 to 2012, the combined mentions of the economy, jobs or inflation averaged 34% in the six years when the incumbent won and 70% in the three years when the incumbent lost.

The disjuncture this year between Americans' low ratings of economic conditions and their low mentions of the economy as the top problem is a pattern not previously seen over the years Gallup has tracked both measures.

One reason economic mentions were not higher in April and May of this year, more in line with the negative ECI scores that had set in by then, is that COVID-19 was the dominant response, named by 40% to 45% of Americans. That was followed by government (reflecting a mix of grievances about the leaders in both parties). As troubling as the economy was, Americans were simply more focused on other things. More recently, race relations has emerged as a top-tier issue.

However, because up to three responses are recorded for each respondent, one might expect economic mentions to be even higher than they currently are. The fact that they aren't could mean that Americans believe the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 is temporary, or they may simply categorize today's economic problems as fundamentally stemming from COVID-19.

How this figure changes between now and November could indicate whether the 2020 recession is a strong liability for Trump.

Bottom Line

Before the coronavirus brought the country to a near standstill in March, Americans' ratings of the economy and the president's performance on it were as good as they get in an election year. Other issues may have ultimately overshadowed the economy in voters' choice for president, but the economy was still a positive component of the value proposition Trump was offering for another four years in office.

With the U.S. economy formally slipping into a recession in February, Trump's reelection now appears in jeopardy. At the same time, the 2020 recession is unusual in that it was brought on by a pandemic, at least partially shielding Trump from blame. These nuances are seen in Trump's approval rating on the economy, which remains relatively strong, and the low percentage of Americans still citing the economy as the nation's top problem.

Normally, how these metrics shift over the next four months could affect whether Trump wins or loses in November, and by how much. But with the coronavirus still ravaging the country and Trump's job approval rating lagging significantly behind his rating on the economy, it's not clear that the economy will have as much effect as it usually does on the outcome. Americans' confidence in the economy and Trump's handling of it are still likely to have some influence on their vote. But his overall presidential job approval rating may better capture the multitude of factors voters will consider as they cast their ballot.

4,The Trump economy versus the Obama economy in 16 charts - The Washington Post,The Trump economy versus the Obama economy in 16 charts  The Washington Post,"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwLzA5LzA1L3RydW1wLW9iYW1hLWVjb25vbXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"As the United States suffers the worst economic downturn in nearly a century, key questions remain: How quickly can the nation recover, and who has the better track record to get us there? The dire job losses from the spring are close to half recovered, but 13.6 million workers remain unemployed. Stocks are back near record highs, but food bank lines are long and evictions in parts of the country are growing.

The 2020 presidential election will be, at least partly, about the economy. President Trump argues the economy was soaring pre-pandemic and he can bring it back again, while former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, argues the nation wouldn’t be in such bad shape if Trump hadn’t fumbled the handling of the pandemic. Biden says he can get people working again and points to the Obama administration’s track record after the Great Recession. Trump portrays the Obama era as sluggish.

Perhaps the best case Trump can make for improvement since he took office is higher wages and a boost in confidence. The average worker’s pay finally grew more than 3 percent a year under Trump, and there was a drop in the number of Americans on food stamps. Consumer and business confidence also jumped after Trump’s election and remained high after the GOP tax cuts took effect in 2018. As recently as February, many Americans rated this as the best economy since the late 1990s. Now those gains are wiped out.

The pandemic recession triggered more than 22 million job losses, modern-day bread lines and millions of pay cuts. Even before the pandemic hit, the picture was mixed. Manufacturing, business investment and growth were slowing noticeably heading into 2020.

While there’s ongoing debate about how much influence presidents really have over the economy, the charts below illustrate the trends under then-President Barack Obama and Trump.

1. Job gains (and losses)

The United States experienced some of its best years of job gains in 2014 and 2015 in Obama’s second term when the economy added more than 225,000 jobs a month. Employment continued to be strong under Trump — until the pandemic hit.

Average monthly job gains under Trump peaked at 193,000 in 2018. Economists call this very robust, especially given the recovery was nearly a decade old by then. But the devastation from the pandemic wiped out a decade’s worth of jobs gains in the spring. By August, 48 percent of the jobs had returned.

2. Economic growth

Trump says he had the “greatest economy in history” during the GOP convention, a claim fact-checkers quickly marked as false. A look at economic growth shows why.

The economy grew just shy of 1 percent in Obama’s first term when the Great Recession took its toll. Growth improved to 2.3 percent in Obama’s second term. Under Trump, the economy is on track to average slightly above zero in his first term because of the sharp losses from the pandemic.

Excluding 2020, growth in Trump’s initial three years in office was 2.5 percent — barely above Obama and well below the growth under the Clinton, Reagan and Johnson administrations.

3. U.S. unemployment

The U.S. unemployment rate hit a half-century low of 3.5 percent in late 2019 and stayed around that level through February 2020. Trump frequently touted the job news, though he often left out that the unemployment rate was a fairly low when he took office (4.7 percent) and has been steadily declining since 2011.

As the pandemic escalated, Trump and other officials opted to close down much of the economy to keep people home to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. This caused the official unemployment rate to soar to nearly 15 percent in April. The Labor Department had trouble doing its usual worker surveys during the pandemic and says the unemployment rate likely reached as high as 19.7 percent — a level not seen since the Great Depression. But as the economy reopened, many jobs came back. By August, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.4 percent, a level that’s still high but not unprecedented.

4. Black unemployment rate

Trump has started making the claim that his administration has done more for African Americans than “any president since Abraham Lincoln,” which The Washington Post Fact Checker gave Four Pinocchios. A key part of Trump’s argument is the Black unemployment rate, which hit the lowest level ever recorded — 5.4 percent — in August 2019. (The Labor Department began tracking the Black rate in 1972).

When Trump took office, Black unemployment was 7.5 percent. Many of the job gains under Trump did go to Black and Hispanic workers, especially women. As the labor market tightened, many employers gave a chance to workers they were not looking at before, such as those without college degrees. The pandemic, however, has hit Black and Hispanic workers the hardest, erasing many of the gains it took years to see after the Great Recession. In August, the Black unemployment rate was 13 percent.

5. Middle-class income

Middle-class households were hit hard during the Great Recession. For years, their incomes remained lower than in the late 1990s, once the cost of living was taken into account. While incomes rose the most during the final two years of Obama’s term, median household income did not officially equal its 1999 level until 2018, according to the U.S. Census.

Economists generally credit Obama with getting the recovery solidly underway and Trump with keeping it going until the pandemic recession. The steady job and pay gains in recent years have been the biggest drivers of rising middle-class incomes.

6. U.S. stock market

One of Trump’s favorite indicators is the U.S. stock market. Even with the deep blow of the pandemic that caused a 30 percent drop in stocks in March, the market has come roaring back this summer. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index recently surpassed its pre-pandemic record level thanks largely to surging tech stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft and Google’s parent, Alphabet. The index has fallen some in the past week.

Many economists are quick to point out the stock market is not the economy. Analysts also note that stocks gained more in Obama’s first term than Trump’s. But that comes with a caveat: Stocks began Obama’s presidency in a deep slump from the financial crisis and then began an epic rebound a few weeks into his presidency. The market was already high when Trump took office and has climbed higher since then. Though Obama had better market gains, both presidents have been good for Wall Street.

7. Food stamps

While the stock market was quick to soar under Obama, many people were quick to point out that the United States still had record numbers of Americans on food stamps, a sign of the lingering pain of the Great Recession. By 2013, roughly 1 in every 6 Americans was on government food aid. That declined only slightly by the end of Obama’s tenure.

The Trump administration made it a goal to get the number of Americans on food stamps down, including by tightening rules about who is eligible for food aid. As a result of more stringent eligibility rules and more job gains in recent years, the number of Americans on food stamps dropped to 35.7 million in 2019 — the lowest level since 2009. The pandemic has ushered in deep hardship again, causing many Americans to seek food stamps and visit food banks for the first time. Photos of long lines of cars waiting outside food banks during the pandemic have been dubbed modern-day bread lines.

8. Manufacturing output

The end of Obama’s second term saw a mini manufacturing recession that deeply hurt blue-collar workers even as the service economy continued to chug along. Trump vowed to revive factories. Early on in his presidency, manufacturing jobs and output jumped. In 2018, manufacturing jobs were growing at the fastest clip since the early 1980s. But it didn’t last.

Manufacturing output and jobs stalled in 2019, an early warning sign of economic trouble. The pandemic was a major blow. Real-time indicators show some rebound in manufacturing, especially as auto sales and home sales have bounced backed. But manufacturing employment remains more than 700,000 jobs below pre-pandemic levels.

9. U.S. home prices

Home prices have been on a steadily upward climb even since bottoming out in 2011. A lot of this growth has been driven by the Federal Reserve. The Fed has kept interest rates low, which has led to historic lows in mortgage rates that have made home-buying more affordable for many families (as long as they have savings for a down payment).

Even the pandemic didn’t put much of a dent in home purchases. In fact, some city dwellers have been rushing to the suburbs in search of bigger homes with more space. That trend, combined with a surge in millennials buying homes and mortgage rates below 3 percent, have fueled a housing boom. The median home price in the United States hit $304,100 in July, according to the National Association of Realtors. It’s the highest price on record, surpassing the prior 2006 high in inflation-adjusted terms.

10. U.S. government debt

Both Obama and Trump have been criticized for growing the national debt. Spending increased under Obama as the federal government tried to revive the economy after the Great Recession, as well as fund the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and continuing most of the Bush tax cuts.

Trump’s 2017 tax cut added about $1.5 trillion more to the debt, contrary to claims by the president’s administration that it would not. Then the pandemic hit and Congress responded with more than $3 trillion in aid. The result is the national debt is at the highest levels since World War II. The closely watched debt-to-GDP ratio, a sign of how big U.S. debt held by the public is relative to the economy, is on track to surpass 100 percent in the coming months.

Many economists say the bulge in spending after the Great Recession and pandemic recession were necessary and unavoidable, but they fault Obama and Trump for not doing more to right the federal budget during the good economic years.

11. Consumer confidence

Consumer spending drives about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. Many economists and business leaders closely watch signs of consumer confidence to see if Americans are likely to keep buying. The two main gauges of consumer confidence are monthly surveys by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan. Both showed an increase in confidence after Trump’s election, largely because Republicans and independent voters rated the economy more highly.

As the unemployment rate continued to decrease, confidence hit levels not seen since the late 1990s in early 2020. Though much of the economy under Trump looked similar to under Obama, many Americans appeared to feel better about their job and business prospects. Then the pandemic hit, causing confidence to tank. Nearly 1 in 3 Americans now worries about losing their job, according to Gallup.

12. Wages

While the economy did a big U-turn under Obama, his administration admitted that its “unfinished business” was seeing wages grow faster again. When the economy is performing well, it’s usually hard for employers to find enough workers, and they start lifting pay by more than 3 percent a year. That did not happen in the Obama era. It took until the summer of 2018 to finally see average hourly earnings rising above 3 percent.

13. Gas prices

Gas prices were well above $3 a gallon for much of Obama’s tenure. Many Americans see these prices as they drive to work, and it influences their overall feeling about the economy. As prices rise, they tend to feel gloomier as gas costs eat into their weekly pay. But oil prices plunged in 2014 as the world’s major oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, refused to cut back production, leading to a glut of oil on the world market.

When Trump took office, gas prices were just $2.37 a gallon, on average. They have remained low throughout Trump’s first term, helping keep costs manageable for many Americans. Though Trump likes to tout that America is now “energy independent” because it exports oil again, the reality is the nation still depends on imports of crude oil from abroad. The rise and fall of gas prices are largely driven by the world market and power players like Saudi Arabia that have continued to pump cheap oil.

14. Americans with health insurance

Obama made it one of his top goals to get more Americans covered by health insurance. The number of Americans lacking health insurance went from more than 48 million people in 2010 down to 28 million after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

The uninsured rate has remained low under Trump, though it ticked up slightly after Trump did away with the penalty for American adults who don’t buy health insurance. Trump also made it a goal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but that has not happened in his first term.

15. Business investment

An ongoing problem for the U.S. economy in recent years has been sluggish business investment. The economy tends to perform better when firms spend more on new research, products and equipment, since that tends to lead to more innovation.

Business investment was slow at the end of Obama’s second term. Trump and many Republicans said their 2017 tax cut would spur a business investment boom. Though 2018 did see improved business investment, the bump was short-lived. Business investment was anemic again in 2019, even before the pandemic’s economic blow.

16. Trade deficit

Most economists paid little attention to the trade deficit before Trump ran for office. The United States has purchased more goods from abroad than it has sold for years, largely because American consumers like to shop. Economists didn’t worry about this because foreign nations would turn around and invest in the U.S., so the dollars typically came back, one way or another.

But Trump insisted deficits were a sign of weakness. He promised his trade deals would get the deficit back down. What happened instead is the overall trade deficit in 2018 was the largest in a decade."

Almost 30 million people are now collecting unemployment benefits. Yet President Trump still gets relatively high marks for his handling of the economy.

As Republicans focus on ""opportunity"" at their convention Tuesday, the economy remains one of the president's strongest selling points.

""You see the kind of numbers that we're putting up. They're unbelievable,"" Trump told supporters in Minnesota last week. ""More jobs in the last three months than ever before.""

In boasting about the big job gains in May, June and July, Trump conveniently omits the historic job losses in March and April. So far, the U.S. has recovered less than half of the jobs that disappeared this spring.

Ordinarily, a double-digit unemployment rate would be crippling for a president seeking reelection. Consider the price that George H.W. Bush paid in 1992 for what was, in hindsight, a relatively mild recession.

Despite his popularity after winning the first Gulf War, Bush's economic approval rating plummeted to 18%. Although the unemployment rate that year never reached 8%, Bush was sent packing in an election characterized by James Carville's famous phrase, ""It's the economy, stupid.""

Loading...

Although the current recession is much deeper, Trump's economic approval rating continues to hover near 50%.

""What's going on is the memory of the economy before the pandemic,"" says Republican pollster Whit Ayres.

He believes many Americans are still judging Trump by the economy as it was six months ago, before the coronavirus took hold here.

""It was rolling,"" Ayres recalls. ""Unemployment was at historic lows. The economy was in great shape before the pandemic killed it.""

Presidential approval ratings in general don't swing up and down as much as they used to. Americans have increasingly sorted themselves into highly polarized camps, reluctant to abandon their own standard-bearer or show even grudging approval for the other side.

Trump may also be getting a pass on the economy because Americans are more concerned with other problems, including race relations and especially the pandemic itself.

""People see COVID as the problem and the economy as a symptom,"" says Lydia Saad, director of U.S. social research for Gallup. ""They're viewing [the economic downturn] sort of like a hurricane. Something that's happened. It's come in. It's created all sorts of havoc. But it's going to go away and things are going to get back to normal.""

That's how Mark Schneider sees it. He retired from the Navy after 20 years on nuclear submarines and now runs an advocacy group for nuclear power. Last week, as the S&P 500 stock index was heading for a record high, Schneider tweeted that the Trump economy is ""unstoppable."" He thinks the recession will soon pass.

""It just feels temporary,"" Schneider says. ""We just kind of paused the economy, as opposed to something mucking the system.""

As he drives around his home of Chesapeake in southeastern Virginia, Schneider is confident that a lot of people feel the same way.

""I have yet to see a single Biden sign in my entire city. I haven't seen a bumper sticker. I haven't seen anything Biden. But there's Trump flags flying everywhere,"" Schneider says. ""My forecast is that Trump's going to take this thing in a landslide.""

Ayres, the GOP pollster, is not so certain. Despite Trump's solid grade on the economy, it may not be enough to save the president, come November.

""The coronavirus has driven out everything else,"" Ayres says.

Trump's overall approval rating is considerably lower than his economic marks, weighed down in part by his handling of the pandemic. And until there's a solution for the coronavirus, Ayres says it's going to be difficult for the economy to come roaring back."
6,Data show Trump didn't 'build' a great economy. He inherited it. - NBC News,Data show Trump didn't 'build' a great economy. He inherited it.  NBC News,"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL21lZXQtdGhlLXByZXNzL2RhdGEtc2hvdy10cnVtcC1kaWRuLXQtYnVpbGQtZ3JlYXQtZWNvbm9teS1oZS1pbmhlcml0ZWQtbjEyMzc3OTPSASxodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtcC9uY25hMTIzNzc5Mw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s campaign speeches can careen into many topics, but his primary appeal continues to be that he built “the greatest economy that we've had in our history” before the COVID-19 pandemic and he can do it again. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows he has an edge with voters on that issue and the Trump economy is likely to be a big topic this week at the Republican convention.

But the real story of the Trump economy, and the president’s role in building it, is not so simple. If you compare key economic indicators from Barack Obama’s second term in office to the first three years of Trump’s time (that is, before the pandemic hit), the data show a continuation of trends, not a dramatic shift. It suggests Trump didn’t build something new; rather he inherited a pretty good situation.

Start with the broadest measure of economic health, gross domestic product. In 2016, Trump said he was unhappy that the country’s economic growth rate was under 3 percent a year. Trump said he thought the economy could grow at better-than-4-percent annual rate.

But the numbers show that average quarterly economic growth under Trump, 2.5 percent, was almost exactly what it was under Obama in the second term, 2.4 percent.

Other than the overall similarity, two things jump out of those numbers. First, Trump didn’t get near his 4 percent figure. Second, the growth that began in Obama’s second term and essentially continued under Trump was enough to create an economy that even Trump believes was great. In other words, there might be something to be said for slow-steady growth over a prolonged period of time.

Job numbers for Obama and Trump show a similar story.

The president rightly takes credit for having low unemployment during his presidency. In December of 2019, the unemployment rate was a scant 3.5 percent, the lowest it had been in 50 years.

However, as good as that number was, when Trump took office the rate was already at 4.7 percent. That figure is quite low by historical standards (lower than all of the 1980s as well as most of the 1990s and 2000s). In December of 2017, it was the lowest the number had been since the Great Recession. In fact, Obama saw a much steeper drop in unemployment in his second term, a 3.3 drop in the rate, than Trump did in his first three years, a decline of 1.2 points.

That’s not to besmirch the remarkably low unemployment under Trump, but it’s hard to ignore that the unemployment track under Obama had been downward. Again, the numbers look like the continuation of a trend, not something new.

And the job creation numbers show more evidence for that view.

On average, there were more jobs added monthly in Barack Obama’s second term than there were in Trump's first three years.

On average, the country created 215,000 new jobs a month in Obama’s second term. In Trump’s first three years, the figure was 182,000. They are both good numbers and if you look at the jobs data plotted on a graph, the rise since 2011 actually looks pretty consistent.

But that’s the point. Since the recovery from the last recession the numbers look like a slow, steady build. There is no sudden change when Trump takes office in 2017. There was nothing dramatic in the post-2011 job figures until the pandemic hit this spring.

There is one big indicator that suggests a change under Trump, the rise in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average in particular took off when he won the presidency.

On Dec. 31, 2019, the DJIA was at 28,538. That was up 56 percent from 18,332, where it was the day Trump was elected in 2016. That’s a pretty impressive run. (For the Dow, we use Election Day as the starting measure because investors can and often do react to big news events.)

To be clear, Obama’s figures were not bad on this measure. From his second Election Day until 2016, the Dow climbed 38 percent. But Trump can rightfully brag about that climb and this week the DJIA has recovered most of what it lost in 2020.

The real question is: How important is the Dow to the overall health of the economy? Other lingering problems, such as continued high unemployment and a projected drop in GDP for the year, only emphasize how that one measure doesn’t come close to telling the whole story of the economy.

A president taking credit for the economy is nothing new, of course. It’s a time-honored tradition in politics. And there are parts of the economy that Trump can rightfully celebrate. But the idea that the president somehow rescued a nation that was struggling economically when he arrived simply isn’t borne out in the data.

If Trump is re-elected, he would not be rebuilding the economy again; he would be taking on a new task he did not face when he first arrived in Washington. He might be the right person for that job, but there is little evidence in his record as president that says he is."
7,Data v spin: The truth about Trump and the US economy - Al Jazeera English,Data v spin: The truth about Trump and the US economy  Al Jazeera English,"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIwLzkvMjkvZGF0YS12LXNwaW4tdGhlLXRydXRoLWFib3V0LXRydW1wcy1lY29ub2150gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS8yMDIwLzkvMjkvZGF0YS12LXNwaW4tdGhlLXRydXRoLWFib3V0LXRydW1wcy1lY29ub215?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Al Jazeera English,"Can Trump take credit for the economy’s pre-COVID strength? And did his policies really lift all Americans?

President Donald Trump presided over the final years of an economic expansion in the United States that lasted an unprecedented 128 months. But the record run – which began in June 2009 – came to a halt this year when the US and global economies fell off the COVID-19 cliff.

In a matter of weeks, tens of millions of Americans found themselves out of work as businesses in every sector shut their doors.

Back on February 4 – before lockdown orders swept the nation – Trump highlighted his stewardship of the economy during his State of the Union address, telling the American people:

“From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the US economy – slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements … We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, colour, religion, and creed very, very high.”

But did Trump’s policies really “revive” the economy for the benefit of all Americans? And does Trump or his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, have the winning policy mix to get the economy back on track as the country remains mired in the coronavirus pandemic?

A surge in optimism

The nation’s economic performance hinges on many factors, including human emotions. When businesses feel confident about the outlook, they are more likely to invest in operations to boost capacity and create jobs. When people feel positive about the future of their personal finances, they are more likely to spend – a massively important variable, given consumer spending is the engine of the US economy, driving some two-thirds of growth.

After Trump took office in 2017, the US public started to feel a whole lot better about the economy, a survey by the Pew Research Center found.

Partisanship was a driving factor behind the optimism, with Republicans and Republican-leaning Americans experiencing a surge in positive views.

In January, before COVID-19 disrupted nearly every facet of daily life, Americans generally felt better about their economy than at any point over the past two decades.

Some 44 percent of people said Trump’s policies had made the economy better, compared with 26 percent who said they had no effect.

Of course, that was pre-COVID. To understand how Americans’ views on the economy and potentially four more years of Trump have changed, read on. But first, here is how economic growth and the jobs market changed under Trump – before the coronavirus pandemic struck.

Jobs and GDP

There is no disputing that the economy grew steadily during the first three years of Trump’s presidency, while unemployment continued to fall to hover near a half-century low of 3.5 percent.

The economy’s performance fell well short of the 4 percent – 6 percent growth Trump repeatedly promised to voters, growing 2.2 percent, 3.0 percent and 2.3 percent in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.

Still, the fact that the economy kept growing was touted by Trump’s supporters as evidence of the economic “revival” he helped spur.

The president’s critics though are not so quick to give the political outsider credit.

Instead, they point out that the economy had been on an upward trajectory since June 2009, when it began its long crawl out of the deep hole that was the Great Recession. To detractors, Trump was simply enjoying the momentum created under by the Obama-Biden administration.

When measured against the data, “revival” is not a fair characterisation. But the expansion that Trump inherited was rather long in the tooth by post-World War II standards.

When he took office in January 2017, the economy was in its 91st consecutive month of growth, and economists, policymakers and investors were seriously questioning how much longer it would continue.

Before 2009, the average run for a post-war growth cycle was 53.25 months, while the previous record run – 120 months from March 1990 to March 2001 – was credited, in large part, to the IT revolution that turbocharged productivity.

There was no IT revolution afoot when Trump was inaugurated, and yet the economy kept expanding for 37 months on his watch.

Which begs the question – was it Trump’s policies that kept the trend going?

Souring trade wars

Trump won the presidency in part on his promise to put “America First” and revive the nation’s flagging manufacturing sector.

A hallmark of his administration has been the use of tariffs against major trading partners with the aim of giving goods produced in the US an edge over competitive imports.

Starting in 2018, the US unleashed three separate rounds of actions. The first two targeted all major US trading partners by slapping tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines, then steel and aluminium. The third and biggest round was aimed at the US’s largest competitor and the world’s second-largest economy: China

Over the course of 18 months, the Trump administration slapped punitive levies on $370bn worth of Chinese goods. China responded with retaliatory tariffs on $100bn of US exports.

In January this year, both sides entered into a phase one agreement that saw China pledge to boost purchases of US exports, tighten protections for US intellectual property, stop forced technology transfers and open up its financial services market to US players.

But instead of boosting the US manufacturing sector, the Trump trade wars had the opposite effect – at least in the short term.

What was a healthy manufacturing landscape during Trump’s first year in office started to turn sour in 2018, when factory output began to decline and employment in the sector stalled.

The inflection point hit after the Trump administration started slapping significant tariffs on Chinese goods.

The downward trend was the result of tariffs increasing the costs of imported raw materials for some US businesses, and the negative effect retaliation from trading partners had on US exports, a study by the Federal Reserve found.

Tax reform

In 2017, Trump scored a significant legislative achievement with his signature Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA). The largest overhaul to the federal tax code since 1986, it was sold by Trump and Republicans in Congress as a reform that would “pay for itself” by boosting growth, driving business investment, creating more jobs and raising wages for workers.

The TCJA instituted many reforms, but the big highlights for business included slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and revising business tax deductions and international tax rules.

For individuals, the TCJA increased the child tax credit, doubled the standard deduction and reduced the upper limits of most individual tax brackets while lowering rates.

But for all those reforms, the promised economic payoff has yet to materialise. While corporations repatriated a significant amount of income they had hoarded abroad and got a massive tax cut on domestic profits, business investment did not catch fire.

Instead, corporations appeared to use their TCJA windfall to purchase their own stock – driving up wealth for shareholders while doing little to create jobs and boost workers’ wages.

The Congressional Research Service looked at the data and determined that in 2018, the TCJA was not only failing to pay for itself, but it also had “a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy”.

But that does not mean the TCJA was a complete failure. The drag on growth from the Trump administration’s tariffs may have offset the stimulus effect of tax cuts. Moreover, tax changes can take years to ripple through the economy.

One thing that is certain, while the TCJA lowers taxes for American households across the income scale, the better-off get a way bigger break.

An analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think-tank in Washington, DC found that the largest cuts as a share of after-tax income go to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles of income distribution, while the poorest households reap the smallest tax cuts.

And after 2025, when the individual tax cuts expire, the nation’s poorest would see their taxes actually increase, while wealthy households would continue to get a tax break.

Of course, big or small, a tax break is a tax break. And it is highly likely consumer spending was boosted by putting more money in Americans’ pockets, especially low and middle-income earners.

But here, too, there were other forces at play driving growth. In 2018, the TCJA was not the only fiscal policy stimulating the economy. The federal government had also boosted its spending on defense and nondefense programmes in a major way.

Narrowing the inequality gap

There is no disputing that major benchmarks of inequality narrowed on Trump’s watch before the pandemic, largely due to the red hot, pre-COVID jobs market.

Not only was the US unemployment rate hovering near a half-century low before lockdowns were initiated – the gap between the white unemployment rate and the African American and Latino unemployment rates had decreased to the narrowest on record.

Median household income adjusted for inflation was $68,703 in 2019, an increase of 6.8 percent from the previous year – and the fifth consecutive annual bump, according to the Census Bureau.

The official poverty rate in 2019 was 10.5 percent – the lowest rate observed since the Census started tracking it in 1959. Income inequality also decreased slightly in 2018 and 2019 by some measurements.

Meanwhile, as US Federal Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month, anecdotal evidence gathered by the US Federal Reserve through its “Fed Listens” series found that “the robust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum”.

Pandemic and perceptions

The coronavirus pandemic has launched the economy into uncharted territory. Never before in the history of the nation has a shock hit the economy so swiftly and so ferociously. Some 22 million jobs were lost in March and April as businesses closed and Americans were forced to shelter in place.

Thanks to trillions of dollars in lending stimulus from the Federal Reserve and virus relief aid from Congress, the economy has regained roughly half of the jobs lost.

But as the November 3 election draws closer, and Republicans and Democrats continue to butt heads in Congress over a new round of stimulus funding for struggling businesses and households, there are myriad signs America’s economic recovery is starting to plateau.

Layoffs remain widespread, consumer spending is slowing down and output at the nation’s factories is shifting into low gear.

Little wonder, then, the economy consistently ranks as a top issue with voters.

President Trump has presented the formula he used on America’s pre-COVID economy – America-first trade policies, extending tax cuts and rolling back regulations – as the winning combo for getting the post-COVID economy back on track.

Biden’s blueprint, by contrast, aims to revive the economy with policies that redress long-standing racial and wealth inequalities and tackle climate change. The Democratic presidential nominee has pledged to reverse some of Trump’s tax cuts, especially for corporations and the wealthy; invest trillions in a clean energy economy, and invest in child and eldercare. Biden has also signalled he will be tough on China, but through the multilateral trade dispute body, the World Trade Organization.

When it comes to who is better for the economy’s performance though, voters have consistently leaned towards Trump.

A recent survey of consumer attitudes by the University of Michigan found that 38 percent of Americans believe Trump is better for the economy, compared to 33 percent who believe Biden is.

As for the 28 percent remaining – they think it makes no difference who sits in the White House.

That reality makes for an interesting state of play in US politics right up to Election Day."

Political scientists and pollsters say it’s likely a good wager.

Trump spent a large portion of his State of the Union address Tuesday touting his economic accomplishments, including cutting taxes and “job killing-regulations.”

“From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy,” Trump said. “In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back,” he added.

Economy is top of mind for many voters. In a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll from December, independent voters ranked the economy as their number one issue.

Trump’s overall approval rating has never risen above 50 percent, according to Gallup, but voters tend to give him higher marks for the economy than they do other areas, such as foreign policy.

Voters appear to be making a distinction, even though Trump’s foreign policy, including his trade war with China and his effort to push through a replacement to the North American Free Trade Agreement, has had a significant effect on the domestic and global economy, injecting short-term uncertainty into the markets in hopes of a longer-term gain.

Like most issues, the numbers tend to break along party lines. Real Clear Politics’ average of various polls show about 55 percent of voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy.

Denver-based pollster Floyd Ciruli said the fact that a majority of voters favor Trump on the economy shows independents and even some Democratic-leaning voters are giving the president credit for the economic expansion that began during former President Barack Obama’s tenure.

Analyses of past elections show that an improving economy — specifically a rise in gross domestic product — gives incumbent presidents like Trump a distinct advantage.

“If GDP growth is positive above about a percentage point, the incumbent party is more likely than not going to win the election,” said Lynn Vavreck, a UCLA political science professor.

In each of the last two quarters, GDP growth has been 2.1 percent. That is far from the 6 percent growth Trump predicted in 2017, and there will be another three fiscal quarters to watch before the November elections. But if the economy continues to hum along as it has for the past few years, it will likely bode well for Trump’s reelection prospects.

In a trend that started under Obama, the unemployment rate has dropped to historic lows during Trump’s three years in office. Plus, wages have started to tick up, albeit not as quickly as some economists have hoped.

There are still some weak points to the current economy. Trump’s trade wars are dragging on the American and global economies. Some economists have warned that the Republican 2017 tax cuts, the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut key interest rates and a boost in government spending that has increased the national deficit have all artificially inflated the nation’s economy.

As the effects of those measures wear off, the economic expansion could slow or even come to an end. Those concerns raised fears of a recession last year, but investors shrugged off most of those concerns as they headed into 2020.

It’s unclear exactly why voters tend to vote for an incumbent president when the economy is growing. One theory is that voters are “rewarding” a president for his economic policies, even though research shows presidents typically have less influence over an economy than they take credit–or get blamed–for.

Another theory: People naturally gravitate toward the status quo because they are afraid that a new president could derail the economy.

Alberto Alesina, a professor of political economy at Harvard University, explains a typical voter mindset this way: “Things aren’t perfect, my wage hasn’t gone up much, but I’m employed and things could go worse, so let’s stick with things as they are.”

That thinking is known in the field of behavioral economics as loss aversion. In essence, people feel losses more strongly than they do gains, which makes them averse to change. Cutting your salary in half, for example, tends to make you more unhappy than doubling your salary makes you happy.

“The fact that there is loss aversion doesn’t mean that things should never change. When people are sufficiently upset about the status quo, they are willing to change it,” Alesina said. But it is a difficult argument to make in a good economy, she added.

Still, political inertia does not mean that a president’s messaging on economics doesn’t matter.

In 1976, the U.S. economy turned around from a recession and saw GDP growth of 5.6 percent under President Gerald Ford. But, Vavreck said, Ford’s campaign did not capitalize on the growing economy as much as he could have — a move that likely contributed to his failure to win reelection.

It’s a mistake Trump is unlikely to repeat. In addition to the State of the Union, Trump regularly touts his economic accomplishments at his campaign rallies. His lawyers even cited his record during the Senate impeachment trial.

So where does that leave the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, who have been campaigning on the message that the current economy is only benefiting the wealthy?

In the Democratic response to the State of the Union, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, told viewers “The American economy needs to be a different kind of strong.”

Any focus on the economy requires people to imagine a scenario in which they are doing better than they are today — and take a risk to try to get there. That can be a tall order for voters who might generally think they are doing O.K. financially — or at least slightly better off than they were four years ago.

“If you want to talk about inequality as an economic issue that is plaguing the country, that is a much harder sell in an economy that is objectively growing,” Vavreck said.

Still, Democratic presidential candidates could take a lesson from Whitmer in other ways.

Whitmer was elected governor of the battleground state in 2018, in a wave of Democratic wins across the nation that was viewed by some analysts as a rebuke to Trump.

Michigan-based pollster Richard Czuba, founder of the political research firm Glengariff Group, said voters in that swing state have a mixed view of the economy.

Trump promised on the 2016 campaign trail to create 25 million jobs and bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas. So far, a little more than 6 million jobs have been created while he has been in office, including 443,000 manufacturing jobs. But few jobs have been brought back from foreign countries and manufacturing is starting to experience a slowdown in some states. Michigan lost 5,300 factory jobs in 2019 while being hit by the trade war with China. However, the USMCA trade deal — which replaced NAFTA — and a Phase 1 trade deal with China could indicate better prospects in the coming months.

But even more than the economy, Czuba said Michigan voters seem to be interested in improving infrastructure, reducing prescription drug prices and having good health insurance — all issues Whitmer focused on in her 2018 campaign and highlighted in her response to the State of the Union.

“It’s these bread-and-butter issues that are really motivating voters right now,” Czuba said.

Political analysts note that the 2020 Democratic candidates for president are targeting their current messages at the Democratic base, but there is still plenty of time to pivot to a broader message intended for independent and moderate voters.

And Vavreck adds that if Democrats are addressing economic inequality couched in a large “umbrella” message about societal values, for example, it could begin to resonate without drawing attention to what could be perceived as Trump’s economic accomplishments.

Czuba said that despite the diverse range of views he hears from voters every day, there is one thing he hears over and over: “They are fatigued” by the partisan rancor in Washington, which has only seemed to worsen with Trump’s impeachment that has gone on for months.

If Democrats are hoping to win over those frustrated voters despite an economy that is likely to be a boon to Trump’s campaign, 1976 can be a guide. It was that year that Jimmy Carter tapped into the country’s weariness from the the political turmoil that spawned from the Watergate scandal and campaigned on a positive message of love and restoring trust in the federal government.

Political analysts say for Trump, the task is more simple. While he’s not expected to shy away from other divisive issues like immigration, his main message should be consistent. The economy is doing well. Why risk a change?"

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Secretary of the Interior David L. Bernhardt released the Department of the Interior’s Economic Report for Fiscal Year 2019, highlighting the Department’s economic contributions that arise from managing Federal lands and waters and making investments that conserve and restore natural landscapes and the cultural heritage of the Nation. Departmental management of these resources facilitates private sector activities that result in economic contributions across conventional and renewable energy, recreation, non-fuel minerals, irrigation and a wide swath of other activities that supported $336 billion in economic output and 1.9 million jobs across the country.

Compared to FY 2016, 200,000 more jobs were supported contributing an additional $82 billion in economic output for communities throughout the country.

“The Trump Administration agenda for public lands management has been a major boon for communities throughout the country,” said Secretary Bernhardt. “Especially this year, public lands have been a critical place of refuge for the American people and will continue to support the economic vitality of our country.”



For FY 2019, Interior-managed lands and waters produced 1.06 billion barrels of crude oil, 4.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 317 million tons of coal in FY 2019. Last year was the first time oil production from Interior-managed leases had ever surpassed 1 billion barrels, helping make the United States the top producer of crude oil and dry natural gas in in the world. Oil, gas and coal produced from Interior lands and waters supported an estimated $156 billion in economic output and an estimated 665,000 jobs.

One-fifth of the nation’s energy supply came from Interior-managed lands and waters.

Approximately $12 billion in revenues were collected from all energy production on Federal and American Indian-owned lands and offshore areas, which was nearly double that of FY 2016 revenues. Disbursements paid to states and Tribes from energy lease revenues go right back to the communities where the energy was produced, providing critical funding for schools, public services, conservation improvements, coastal restoration and infrastructure projects that create and support American jobs.

National parks, refuges, campgrounds and other public lands sites managed by Interior hosted an estimated 501 million recreational visits in FY 2019—up from 473 million in FY 2016. These visits supported an estimated $60.6 billion in economic output and an estimated 469,000 jobs nationwide.

Interior stores and delivers water for irrigation, municipal and industrial uses, and other purposes that supported an estimated $61.6 billion in economic output, and 455,000 jobs.

Trump Administration Leads Economic Revival in 2020

The Trump Administration remains intensely focused on helping every American enterprise remain viable, recover, and once again, thrive at historic levels even beyond last year’s significant economic growth and progress. Public lands indirectly and directly support thousands of small businesses. Small businesses employ nearly half of the entire private-sector workforce and create two-thirds of all net new jobs in the United States.

The Trump Administration created nearly 7 million jobs in the first three years, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment rates for African Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans hit their lowest levels ever, and we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years. Our country’s economic revival continues to defy all expectations as 11.4 million jobs have been added back since the start of re-opening, and in September, the unemployment rate dropped in 38 states.

The Trump Administration has also made numerous commonsense regulatory reforms that have been critical to keeping businesses viable and growing, uplifting the economy without sacrificing critical environmental protections. In FY 2019 alone, regulatory reform actions across the Trump Administration resulted in a savings of approximately $13.5 billion in net present value."

But governors from both parties were quick to push back, noting they have primary responsibility for ensuring public safety in their states and would decide when it’s safe to begin a return to normal operations.

Trump would not offer specifics about the source of his asserted power, which he claimed, despite constitutional limitations, was absolute.

“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said at the White House. “The governors know that.”

The comments came not long after Democratic leaders in the Northeast and along the West Coast announced separate state compacts to coordinate their efforts to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses on their own timetables.

Anxious to put the crisis behind him, Trump has been discussing with senior aides how to roll back federal social distancing recommendations that expire at the end of the month.

While Trump has issued national recommendations advising people stay home, it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing non-essential businesses. Some of those orders carry fines or other penalties, and in some jurisdictions extend into the early summer.

And governors made clear Monday they wouldn’t tolerate pressure to act before they deem it safe.

“All of these executive orders are state executive orders and so therefore it would be up to the state and the governor to undo a lot of that,” New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said on CNN.

“The government doesn’t get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level,” said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.

Meanwhile, governors were banding together, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island agreeing to coordinate their actions. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar pact. While each state is building its own plan, the three West Coast states have agreed to a framework saying they will work together, put their residents’ health first and let science guide their decisions.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, stressed the efforts would take time.

“The house is still on fire,” Murphy said on a conference call with reporters. “We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we’re going to need ... to make sure this doesn’t reignite.”

Trump, however, insisted it was his decision to make.

“The president of the United States calls the shots,” he said, promising to release a paper outlining his legal argument.

Trump can use his bully pulpit to pressure states to act or threaten them with consequences, but the Constitution gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials.

Though Trump abandoned his goal of beginning to roll back social distancing guidelines by Easter, he has been itching to reboot an economy that has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities. The closure has also undermined Trump’s reelection message, which hinged on a booming economy.

Trump’s claim that he could force governors to reopen their states also represents a dramatic shift in tone. For weeks Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.

While Trump can use his daily White House briefings and Twitter account to try to shape public opinion and pressure governors to bend to his will, “there are real limits on the president and the federal government when it comes to domestic affairs,” John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, said on a recent Federalist Society conference call.

Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, a supporter of Trump, said the question of when to lift restrictions would be “a joint effort” between Washington and the states.

Talk about how and when to reboot the nation’s economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was slow to respond to the virus and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.

That frustration was amplified by comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, who told CNN on Sunday that, “obviously,” had the country “started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.”

Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor. But at Monday’s briefing, Trump insisted Fauci’s job was safe after Fauci took the podium to try to explain his comments.

Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations.

But Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that — at least for now — he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.

The speech was obviously an effort to change the subject from impeachment, but it also prefigured the two-track electoral strategy that Trump is likely to pursue after the impeachment trial is done. For the members of his base and other ardent Republicans, he will offer the same strongman platform that he offered in 2016: nativism, protectionism, and slashing attacks on the Democrats and the media. For less committed voters, the Trump campaign will serve up a more traditional incumbent message: “Things are going well. Why risk it all by electing my radical opponents?”

The first task of the Democratic candidate, whoever it is, will be to point out the manifest dangers of giving a figure like Trump four more years in office. That shouldn’t be too hard. But the Democrat will also need an economic counter-narrative that directly addresses the points Trump made in Davos. Actually, that isn’t very hard either, but it will involve debunking his claims and pointing out that it is he who has engaged in radical and damaging policies, the costs of which the country will be bearing for decades. Let’s look at some of the points he made:

When I spoke at this forum two years ago, I told you that we had launched the great American comeback. Today, I’m proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before.

Even allowing for Trump’s tendency to exaggerate, this is a ridiculous claim. The truth is that he has presided over a modest pickup in G.D.P. growth, but he has signally failed to fulfill his campaign goal of raising the economy’s growth rate to four per cent.

Between the summer of 2009, when the Great Recession ended, and January, 2017, when Trump took office, the economy had been growing at an annual rate of about 2.2 per cent. Since the start of 2017, the growth rate has risen to about 2.6 per cent. But between 1947 and 1973, G.D.P. growth averaged more than four per cent, and, from 1997 through 2000, it was close to 4.5 per cent.

More recently, there were a couple of quarters in 2014, and also a quarter each in 2009 and 2011, when the growth rate was four per cent or higher. Under Trump, the quarterly growth rate hasn’t risen above 3.5 per cent. In the third quarter of last year, the most recent period for which we have data, it was 2.1 per cent.

The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any U.S. President in recorded history. We started off with a reasonably high rate.

Actually, Trump inherited an unemployment rate that was already low: 4.7 per cent in January, 2017. Since then, the rate has fallen an additional 1.2 percentage points, taking it down to 3.5 per cent, which is the lowest rate since the late sixties. But Trump doesn’t deserve much credit. If you look at a chart of the jobless rate since the start of 2010, it has fallen continuously. If anything, job growth has slowed a little since Trump took office. According to the nonfarm payroll figures from the Labor Department, about a million more jobs were created in the final three years of the Obama Administration than in the first three years of this Administration. That isn’t particularly surprising, given the length of the recovery, but it undercuts Trump’s claims.

This is a blue collar boom. . . . Real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded. The American dream is back, bigger, better and stronger than ever before. No one is benefiting more than America’s middle class.

Here, again, Trump is claiming credit for a trend that pre-dated him. After having fallen for almost a decade, median household income—the income of the household in the very middle of the income distribution—finally started rising again in 2015, under Obama, and the pickup has continued during this Administration. Rather than any policy changes, the buoyant jobs market has been the driving factor. When the unemployment rate is low, workers are hard to find, so employers are forced to offer higher wages and longer hours. That allows middle-class families to earn modestly higher incomes.

Make no mistake, though—the biggest winners during the past three years have been the rich rather than the middle class. As usual, Trump boasted about the stock market, which is hitting new record highs. He didn’t mention that the wealthiest ten per cent of households own more than ninety per cent of all stocks and mutual funds, or that the 2017 tax cut, which he championed, was massively slanted toward corporations and the rich. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, middle-income households enjoyed a tax cut of about nine hundred and thirty dollars, whereas households in the top one per cent saw a cut of more than fifty-thousand dollars.

We lowered our business tax from the highest in the developed world down to one that’s not only competitive, but one of the lower taxes.

Trump wasn’t lying here. The 2017 tax bill cut the corporate income-tax rate from thirty-five per cent to twenty-one per cent, and it also contained a huge giveaway for the proprietors of “pass-through” businesses, which, rather than pay the corporate income tax, report income via their owners’ individual tax returns. The key point, which Trump failed to mention, is that there is still no sign of the surge in capital spending and wages that the White House claimed the tax cut would generate. Rather than investing in new offices and equipment, many corporations took the money they saved and spent it on stock buybacks—thus boosting the net worth of their C.E.O.s and stockholders. Workers got very little, and future taxpayers got landed with a huge bill. The tax cut was financed by issuing debt, which has risen by about $2.9 trillion since Trump took office.

If you combine all this, what you get is a giant scam—one that some of the C.E.O.s and Wall Street titans assembled in Davos could probably appreciate. After presenting himself as a populist who would confront a “rigged” economic system, Trump has governed as a plutocrat, showering additional riches on his fellow-members of the one per cent and offering nickels and dimes to the masses. He’s still trying to pull the con; during his speech, he used the word “worker” or “workers” fifteen times, and he claimed to have pioneered a “whole new approach centered entirely on the wellbeing of the American worker.” It isn’t difficult to provide the facts and figures to debunk Trump’s claims. What is needed is a Democratic candidate who can pull them all together and get the message across in language that ordinary people can understand. But that is the subject for another column.

A previous version of this article misstated the unemployment rate in January, 2017, and its subsequent decline."
16,Americans say they feel like this is the best economy since the late 1990s - The Washington Post,Americans say they feel like this is the best economy since the late 1990s  The Washington Post,"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwLzAyLzEwL2FtZXJpY2Fucy1mZWVsLWdvb2QtZWNvbm9teS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"Americans increasingly rate this as the best economy since the late 1990s, with a recent surge in optimism, even though many economic metrics show striking similarities to the final years of the Obama administration. Fifty-nine percent of Americans say they are better off financially today than they were a year ago, the highest since 1999, according to a Gallup survey released last week. And nearly three-quarters predict they will do better a year from now, the most optimistic reading that Gallup’s annual “Mood of the Nation” survey has ever recorded.

Other polls and surveys aren’t quite as ebullient, but nearly all show that Americans are far less worried about the economy and their personal financial situations than they were during the last presidential election.

Upbeat sentiment is critical for the U.S. economy because it motivates consumer spending, the most important driver of U.S. economic growth. And President Trump is counting on a strong economy to motivate voters to turn out at the polls and reelect him.

Bryan DeHenau runs a roofing business in Macomb County, Mich., just outside Detroit. Around the time of the last presidential election, he had enough jobs to keep one crew busy, but some of the gigs were barely profitable. Today he can keep three crews busy during the spring and summer months, and he has been able to raise prices, regularly giving people estimates of $20,000 to totally redo a roof and finding that “they don’t even bat an eye about it anymore.”

“I’m driving a brand-new 2019 Ford F-250. I’ve got work coming out the ying-yang. I’m doing okay,” DeHenau said. “Four years ago, I couldn’t sleep at night. That’s a pretty big turnaround.”

Some of the biggest recent increases in consumer confidence have come from independent voters and less affluent households, according to Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. His team always asks people to explain why they feel confident, and lately they are hearing near-record levels of people saying their income and wealth are rising.

“We’ve only seen this many people mention income gains twice before: 1966 after the 1960s expansion and 2000 after the 1990s expansion,” Curtin said.

In interviews with six small-business owners across the country, all acknowledged that the economy had turned around under President Barack Obama, but they pointed out that three more years of steady growth, solid job gains and additional stock market records under Trump had turned “cautious optimism” into full-blown optimism.

Business owners varied in how much credit they would give Trump personally, but all had examples of how they had more work than they could handle and were buying equipment and bringing on new people in ways that had not happened since before the Great Recession. Trump’s approval rating on the economy hit an all-time high last month, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 225,000 jobs in January, beating forecasters’ expectations and further dampening concerns about a recession. Many workers have also felt better off financially thanks to tax cuts, cheaper gas prices and minimum-wage increases in more than 20 states. Wage growth has inched up for rank-and-file workers in recent months, although it remains below the stellar levels of the late 1990s.

Economists say one of the biggest drivers of consumer confidence is job quantity. Confidence rises when people feel as if it is easy to get a job, even if it is not a high-paying one.

Job growth has slowed lately, averaging 182,000 a month under Trump vs. 220,000 a month in the 37 months at the end of Obama’s tenure. But the health of the labor market is evident, with the unemployment rate near half-century lows at 3.6 percent. The nation has added over 2 million jobs every year for the past nine years, an unprecedented streak of steady gains.

“Your chance of going to work tomorrow and getting laid off is lower than it’s ever been going back to 1948,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “That feeling of job security is very important.”

DeHenau, 33, calls this the best economy of his working years. He voted for Obama and then Trump. He gives Obama credit for getting the upswing going, but he thinks the economy would not be as good as it is now without Trump.

“I give Trump 80 to 90 percent of the credit,” DeHenau said. “Even under Obama when it was good, there was no profitability.”

There has been less praise for Trump in the manufacturing sector, which tumbled into a technical recession last year as the president’s trade war drove up prices and hurt purchases from other parts of the world.

Jamison Scott, who runs a small manufacturing company in Woodbridge, Conn., remembers the ugly surprise he got after Trump enacted steel tariffs in March 2018 and steel prices soared about 20 percent.

Scott, who manufactures and distributes air ducts and says he uses American steel, was worried how his company could manage the extra cost — or even keep getting enough steel. One steel shipment he ordered that year showed up with about a quarter less material than what he requested.

But steel prices have come back down in recent months, a welcome relief for Scott, and his business from throughout the country has picked up. Enough cash has been coming in that he bought a new plasma cutter and seam welder, the types of big purchases he had not made in years.

“Customers we haven’t heard from in a while are coming out of the woodwork,” said Scott, the executive vice president of Air Handling Systems. “The biggest difference for me is the volatility is gone.”

Manufacturing is now a smaller part of the overall U.S. economy, which is driven largely by the fast-growing service sector. Still, there are signs of a potential pickup, even for manufacturing. A popular manufacturing gauge, the Institute for Supply Management survey, recently reported its first expansionary reading since July.

Trump’s recent “Phase One” trade deal with China includes promises that China will buy more U.S. manufacturing and agricultural products in the next two years, another reason for optimism in sectors hit hard by the trade war.

“The Chinese are sticking to the Phase One deal,” Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, said in an interview. “The president had a good phone call [Thursday] night with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping. Xi said, ‘Look, the expected purchase of U.S. exports may be slightly delayed, but we will make it.’ ”

Michael Canty, president of Alloy Bellows & Precision Welding in Cleveland, is more confident about manufacturing after the recent China deal and Trump’s signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

“All boom cycles have an end — we all know that. But I think this is going to continue for at least another two years,” Canty said. “The reason for that is the trade deals and the regulations that have come off. They are having an effect now.”

There are two big question marks for the U.S. economy this year — how bad the impact of the coronavirus will be and whether business spending will pick up. Kudlow and many private-sector economists have predicted a small impact from the deadly coronavirus on the U.S. economy, shaving off about 0.2 percent from first-quarter growth. But it is yet another reason for leaders of large multinational companies to worry.

While consumers have continued spending at a healthy rate, business investment outside the housing sector contracted from April through December. Many leaders of large corporations do not hold the same economic ebullience that consumers and small-business owners do.

“When we look at the CEO confidence survey, it’s quite a different story,” said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators and surveys at the Conference Board. “They are much more pessimistic. Trade has taken a toll on business investment.”

There are also concerns about the U.S. economy that Democratic presidential candidates have been talking up frequently, especially the lack of higher-paying jobs and the often burdensome costs of health care, child care and college.

Jobs that pay middle-class wages have been going away in recent years, replaced with really high-wage and really low-wage work. That trend is ongoing despite Trump’s repeated promises of a “blue-collar boom.”

17,Trump will leave office with a historically bad economic record - CNN,Trump will leave office with a historically bad economic record  CNN,"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMC8xMi8xMy9wb2xpdGljcy90cnVtcC1lY29ub215LXJlY29yZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMC8xMi8xMy9wb2xpdGljcy90cnVtcC1lY29ub215LXJlY29yZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"CNN —

President Donald Trump still can’t accept the numbers measuring his loss to Joe Biden: more than 7 million popular votes and 74 electoral votes.

But another set of numbers adds insult to his psychological injury. They show that – notwithstanding lies as promiscuous as the ones he tells about election fraud – Trump will leave office in January with a historically bad record on the economy.

That sounds discordant since many Americans believe the economic fable that Trump has repeated relentlessly throughout his term. But placing his bottom-line results alongside those of his predecessors paints a deeply unflattering portrait.

Alone among the 13 presidents since World War Two, Trump will exit the White House with fewer Americans employed than when he started. He will have overseen punier growth in economic output than any of the previous 12 presidents.

His throwback “America First” agenda has failed to restore the old economic engine that powered an earlier era’s prosperity. On Trump’s watch, industrial production has fallen. The Federal Reserve says the manufacturing sector fell into recession in 2019 even before the coronavirus pandemic hit.

Last week was the 38th in a row in which at least 700,000 Americans filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits.

Holiday-season lines at food banks dramatize the scale of human suffering. More abstract measures, such as the US trade deficit and ratio of government debt to the size of the economy, have also worsened during Trump’s term.

“Trump’s economic record ranks near or at the bottom compared with other presidents,” concludes Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi, who compared the economic results of all presidents from the last 70 years. “The economy under his watch has performed very poorly.”

To be sure, the deadliest public health pandemic in a century has devastated economic activity during this last year of the President’s term. But responding to unexpected catastrophe – from hurricanes to terrorist attacks to civil unrest to financial crises – represents a big part of the job. And, as Zandi notes, Trump’s bungled coronavirus response has exacerbated and extended damage to jobs and output.

Trump’s pre-pandemic record

Trump’s record offered little legitimate grounds for boasting before the pandemic. The persistent growth in output and decline in the unemployment rate during his first three years extended trends in the recovery from the Great Recession that he inherited from President Barack Obama.

Growth accelerated in early 2018 following Trump’s sole major legislative achievement, the tax cuts he and Congressional Republicans enacted. But that didn’t last long with the economy already near full employment, and the budget deficit swelled. A temporary surge in investment resulted mainly from higher energy prices.

“It provided no long-term benefit,” Zandi says.

The counter-productive tariff wars Trump initiated quickly offset any short-term benefit from the tax-cuts and the administration’s deregulation push. That’s why Trump, to avoid further damaging the economy in his re-election year, called a truce with China in January without obtaining the structural reforms he had demanded from Beijing. Trump earlier threw away leverage by abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership with allies that the Obama administration had negotiated.

Among Trump’s “very serious policy mistakes,” Zandi said, were his attacks on international and domestic institutions. They include “actively trying to undermine” the Fed’s independence.

Financial markets vs. the real world

Trump can accurately point to above-average financial market gains. Through November the S&P 500 had risen by an average of 14.34% per year during his term, slightly more than the 12.43% under Obama.

But those gains have largely been driven by rock-bottom interest rates, which drive investors into stocks in search of higher returns. And the benefits of those gains accrue largely to the most affluent Americans who own most of the stocks.

The President can also cite a higher-than-average 3.32% annual gain in real per capita disposable income. But that average conceals the extent of those gains that flowed to the affluent, who benefited disproportionately from his tax cuts.

As a candidate in 2016, Trump championed the beleaguered blue-collar workers he called “the forgotten Americans.” His policies have not closed the gap between them and economic elites.

Through the third quarter of 2020, Zandi says, the least wealthy 50% of Americans own just 1.9% of the nation’s net worth, while the top 1% own 30.5%. The surging pandemic promises make that disparity worse before Trump leaves office.

When the Labor Department issues the final monthly jobs report of his presidency in early January, Zandi expects it to show a renewed decline in employment. In the first quarter of 2021, as Trump yields power to Biden, the Wall Street firm JPMorgan predicts that economic output will shrink."

Trump claimed the U.S. economy is “roaring” and “the best it has ever been."" He went as far as to say the nation is “moving forward"" at an “unimaginable” pace, a claim not backed up by the data.

The broad consensus among economists is that the U.S. economy is doing well, but these are not unprecedented times.

In a number of ways, the current economy is the best the nation has seen since the late 1990s. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, economic growth is steady, inflation is tame, and consumer confidence is high. This situation is helping many Americans get jobs and pay raises after years of struggles. Any president would be touting an economy like this, with record low unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanics and people with less than a high school diploma.

“In many ways, I think the United States is doing well. We have a strong labor market,” Janet L. Yellen said Tuesday at a Bipartisan Policy Center event. Yellen is a former chair of the Federal Reserve and a former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton.

But where Trump goes too far is in touting this economy as the “best ever” and trying to portray the end of the Obama era as dire and himself as the hero flying in on the Trump jet to save the day. He has taken steps such as tax cuts to keep the economy growing and increase competitiveness, but he’s also inflicted pain. His tariffs have hurt U.S. manufacturing and agriculture. And his tax cuts and increased government spending have added substantially to the national debt.

Consider economic growth. Last year, the U.S. economy grew 2.3 percent — about average for this expansion and well below the 4 percent level Trump promised. So far in Trump’s term, growth is averaging 2.5 percent. That’s higher than under Presidents Barack Obama or George W. Bush, but much slower than the averages for Clinton and Ronald Reagan.

It’s a similar story looking at the stock market. The return so far for the Dow Jones industrial average during Trump’s tenure is very good (about 45 percent since he took office), but it’s below the returns of Clinton and Obama three years into their respective presidencies.

What’s different today, especially compared with the end of Obama’s second term, is that consumer confidence is significantly higher about the economy. In January 2017, 46 percent of Americans were satisfied with the state of the economy. In January 2020, that was up to 68 percent, according to a recent Gallup poll.

The uptick comes from the fact that nearly 6.7 million more Americans are employed today than when Trump took office. Monthly job gains were stronger under Obama than Trump, but the labor market has tightened further in recent years, helping more people feel better off. A combination of higher wage gains in recent months and Trump’s tax cuts have helped most Americans feel richer, even though many still worry about how to pay for health care, child care and college.

Overall, Trump’s economic track record is mixed. His “Trumponomics” playbook is big tax cuts, deregulation and tariffs. There’s widespread agreement that the tax cuts that took effect in 2018 boosted growth, sent the stock market to record highs and helped fuel the hot labor market, even triggering a hiring binge for blue-collar workers. But the effect was short-lived and came at a hefty cost to the national debt, which has spiked nearly 50 percent under Trump.

The scene at President Trump's third State of the Union address + 41 Amid an impeachment trial in the Senate, Trump makes his third State of the Union speech before a joint session of Congress.

Trump’s eagerness to impose tariffs last year spooked businesses. The tariffs caused companies to drastically scale back spending and pushed U.S. manufacturing into a mild recession in 2019. The tariffs have hit the hardest on parts used to make cars, washing machines and other products, raising costs for U.S. companies. A widely watched gauge of the health of the manufacturing sector — a survey of purchasing managers from the Institute for Supply Management — fell in December to its lowest level since the Great Recession.

The president argues that the tariffs were necessary to win concessions from China and other nations. He recently signed a partial “Phase One” trade deal with China and a revised deal with Mexico and Canada. In the short term, some U.S. businesses suffered clear pain from these tariffs. There’s hope that these deals will lead to more business opportunities for U.S. companies abroad, but that remains to be seen.

Perhaps the best case Trump can make for improvement, since he came into office, is higher wages. The unemployment rate has been falling steadily since 2011, but Obama and his top advisers regularly lamented that pay wasn’t going up much, even in 2015 and 2016. Business leaders believed there were still plenty of people seeking work, so they didn’t need to raise wages to attract and keep workers.

But that dynamic changed in 2018. Average hourly earnings, especially for rank-and-file workers, really started to pick up.

Many economists say businesses were forced to increase pay as the unemployment rate dropped below 4 percent, making it harder to find workers. Minimum wage increases in many states and cities played a role, too. Some economists also credit Trump’s large corporate tax cuts and deregulation push for helping keep the labor market hot.

Trump frequently notes that wage growth has been faster over much of the past year for lower-paid workers and non-managers than it has been for bosses, a welcome sign. He’s right that wage gains for nonsupervisory workers climbed as high as 3.6 percent in October, a level not seen since the crisis, according to the Labor Department, though the rate has since fallen.

As Trump takes a victory lap on the economy, his challenge is to keep the economy on a steady course as many of his tariffs continue to drag down global growth and as the coronavirus presents yet another serious worry for global business.

Trump “undoubtedly is concerned that the economy might be simply a modest plus in November, not the huge advantage that he’s counting on,” said Greg Valliere, chief strategist at AGF Investments.

Alas, the presidential record they’re describing isn’t Trump’s. It belongs to his predecessor, Barack Obama. And perhaps also to Obama’s second-in-command, Joe Biden. Team Trump, in promulgating the myth of Trump’s economic genius, has recently doubled down on a false narrative: that Trump inherited a recession and magically turned it into a boom. This is almost the exact reverse of events of the past 3½ years. In reality Trump inherited from Obama an expansion — one that, in retrospect, turned out to be the longest in U.S. history — and converted it into a bust.

Not just any bust; a possible depression, at least for the working class.

Now, my standard disclaimer applies: Presidents generally get too much credit when the economy is good and too much blame when the economy is bad. They don’t control the business cycle and can affect things only on the margin. For example, they could bungle the response to an existing downturn (by, ahem, appointing incompetent aides, discrediting real experts, increasing distrust in government statistics, alienating crucial allies — that sort of thing).

But Trump has asked to be judged by cold, hard economic metrics. So let’s indulge him.

Follow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions Follow

Right now, employment is down, on net, 6 million jobs since Trump became president. Contrary to White House adviser Peter Navarro’s christening of Trump as “the greatest jobs president” in history, Trump is on track to become the worst jobs president on record. That is, if not reelected, he will likely become the first president since modern employment statistics were recorded to leave office with fewer jobs than there were at his inauguration.

That’s because, while payrolls are growing, we remain deeply in the hole; the Congressional Budget Office recently forecast that under current law the U.S. economy won’t until 2022 recover all the jobs that existed when Trump was inaugurated. Recovering to the level at the start of the pandemic would take even longer.

Team Trump’s response to this unflattering legacy has been simply to invent a different one.

During the Republican National Convention last week, Trump and his surrogates repeatedly claimed that Trump “built” the “strongest,” “best,” “greatest” economy ever. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow touted Trump’s record as “a roaring success.”

There are multiple problems with this spin.

First, it seems peculiar to freeze the record in February as they did, high-school-yearbook-deadline-style, and pretend the past half-year didn’t happen. Whatever the economic conditions at the start of 2020, today — two months before Election Day — unemployment is at 10.2 percent, a higher rate than ever experienced during the Great Recession. And, of course, that’s under Trump’s watch too.

Imagine if Herbert Hoover had run for reelection on a message of: “Remember the first seven months of my presidency? Man, were we booming then!”

Second, the economic trends under Trump even pre-pandemic were decent, but not spectacular. Just as they were under Trump’s predecessor.

Job growth under Trump, pre-coronavirus, continued at about the same pace it had under Obama. Actually, it was a bit slower: Employers added an average of 185,000 jobs per month under Trump through February 2020, compared with 216,000 per month during Obama’s second term. Economic output growth under Trump, pre-pandemic, was likewise roughly equal to that during Obama’s second term.

This despite the fact that Trump benefited from an enormous fiscal stimulus, through both tax cuts and spending increases, and an accommodative Federal Reserve.

At the RNC, Kudlow falsely claimed that Trump had “inherit[ed] a stagnant economy on the front end of recession.” Again, the United States was not in recession when Trump took office (as it had been when Obama was first inaugurated). In January 2017, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent and had been falling steadily for more than seven years. It continued falling at about the same pace over the subsequent three years.

What changed? Only that unemployment data Trump had labeled “phony” under Obama miraculously transformed to “very real” once Trump took office.

Even the more esoteric economic victories Trump might try to claim have been a bust.

So far, China’s promised purchases of U.S. products are below 50 percent of the year-to-date targets set out in Trump’s vaunted trade deal. Despite glowing convention testimonials from a Wisconsin dairy farmer and a Maine lobsterman, their industries have suffered greatly under this president. Wisconsin led the nation in farm bankruptcies last year, with the number of failing farms jumping 20 percent; the value of Maine’s lobster harvest has likewise declined under Trump, because China had been the top U.S. export market.

Meanwhile, Vice President Pence fear-mongers that “our economic recovery is on the ballot.” Kudlow warns that a vote for Biden means turning “back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism.”

JACKSON CENTER, Ohio – Today, U.S. Secretary of the Interior David L. Bernhardt was joined by Airstream leadership as they highlighted the importance of outdoor recreation and the resurgence of the American economy during a visit to the Airstream Factory Service Center. Following a tour of the manufacturing operations, Airstream’s leadership signed the Trump Administration's Pledge to America’s Workers, committing to invest in their workforce and expand job opportunities in Ohio.

Since the program launched in 2018, more than 450 companies have signed the Pledge to America’s Workers, committing to support more than 16.3 million job and training-related opportunities for American workers. More Americans are getting back to work as the economy continues to rebound and reopen. Under the leadership of the Trump Administration, the American economy has added nearly 12 million jobs in the summer and fall of 2020, and outdoor recreation has played a major role in those figures.

“Our economy is coming back to be stronger than before, and it starts with companies hiring and investing in their workers. Airstream is yet another company who has signed the Trump Administration’s Pledge to America’s Workers, creating job opportunities in Ohio,” said Secretary Bernhardt. “The RV industry is an important part of our outdoor recreation economy with millions of RVers traversing into our iconic national parks, refuges and public lands. With President Trump signing the Great American Outdoors Act, we will invest billions of dollars to improve our facilities and infrastructure, so RVers and other visitors can make memories on our public lands for generations to come.”

“The passage of the Great American Outdoors Act comes at an ideal time as many Americans are turning to RVs in unprecedented numbers to experience the great outdoors and our iconic public lands. With so many new RVers, Airstream remains committed as ever to workforce development and job creation here in Ohio,” said Airstream President & CEO Bob Wheeler. “We are excited to host Secretary Bernhardt at our Airstream facility and grateful for his leadership in ensuring that these shared natural spaces receive the funding they deserve. We are also thankful to all members of Congress from both parties who supported this legislation, and to Ohio Senator Rob Portman in particular, who has spent the last decade leading the effort to secure this much needed funding for our public lands.""

“Our country’s renowned national parks are one of the most favored destinations for RVers who will benefit greatly from the passage of the Great American Outdoors Act,” said RV Industry Association Vice President of Government Affairs Jay Landers. “Secretary Bernhardt has been a leader on the issue of improving our public lands and we look forward to continuing to work with him and his team to identify projects that will make the biggest impact to improve the access, safety, and enjoyment of RVers on our public lands for generations to come.”

At Airstream, Secretary Bernhardt discussed the Department of the Interior’s role in facilitating outdoor recreation opportunities across the country, managing approximately 500 million acres of land and how travel trailers help outdoor enthusiasts visit America’s national parks, wildlife refuges and other public lands.

Airstream was founded by Wally Byam in his backyard in Los Angeles in the late 1920s. When production resumed after World War II, Byam opened a new facility in beautiful west-central Ohio. Today, every single one of the Airstream riveted aluminum travel trailers is manufactured by hand in Jackson Center, Ohio. The Jackson Center facility manufactures 120 RVs every week.

The Great American Outdoors Act, recently signed by President Trump, provides $1.9 billion a year for the next five years to address deferred maintenance needs at national parks, refuges, American Indian schools and other public lands throughout the country.

Pandemic aside, the American economy has boomed since 2016, but how much is down to the president's policies?

In the 2016 US presidential election, large swaths of working-class Barack Obama voters switched their support to Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to ""Make America Great Again.""

Vowing to drain the Washington ""swamp"" that he said had sold millions of US jobs overseas, the billionaire businessman and reality TV show host struck a chord with voters, who had, for years, tolerated the offshoring of high-paying jobs, stagnant or falling wages, and rising job insecurity.

By August 2018, Trump was boasting that half a million manufacturing jobs had been created during the first two years of his presidency and that his aggressive, protectionist policies, which included tearing up trade agreements, imposing tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel and the wider US-China trade war, were benefiting the American people.

No Rust Belt revival

A report by the Economic Policy Institute published in August contradicted his claims, however. It found that far from reenergizing the so-called Rust Belt — former industrial areas of the northeastern US that had seen a sharp economic decline since the 1990s — more manufacturing jobs left the US than were created during Trump's first two years in office.

The Washington-based think tank wrote: ""President Trump's erratic, ego-driven and inconsistent trade policies have not achieved any measurable progress, despite the newly combative rhetoric. On top of that, COVID-19 — and the administration's mismanagement of the crisis — have wiped out much of the last decade's job gains in US manufacturing.""

As the president bids for a second term in the White House, he faces derision for his inconsistent response to the coronavirus pandemic. So, trailing his Democratic rival Joe Biden, Trump is playing up the economic successes of his first term.

In the first TV debate against Biden, for example, he claimed that he had ""brought back"" 700,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector. In realty since Trump took office, the bottom line is that 237,000 industrial jobs have been lost, according to fact-checkers at Politifact, a non-profit group.

Record-high stock market

The coronavirus pandemic came at an untimely moment for Donald Trump, who's seeking reelection in November Image: Getty Images/AFP/A. Weiss

US stock markets, he regularly boasts, have skyrocketed under his leadership, even after the initial shock of the pandemic lockdown. Since he took office in January 2017, the Dow Jones is up nearly 40% and at around 27,000 is not far from the previous high of 29,570 in February this year. The NASDAQ has more than doubled in value.

Many economists, however, say the stock market boom began under his predecessor Barack Obama and was fueled by trillions of dollars in quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve and stock buybacks by the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent, Alphabet. Main Street hasn't benefitted from the meteoric stock market rise as much as corporate America.

""Pre-pandemic: In terms of growth, employment gains and inflation, the US economy has performed about the same as under the Obama administration,"" Joel Prakken, chief US economist at IHS Markit, told DW. Asked what economic successes Trump can take credit for, he added: ""Little, if any.""

Tax cuts boosted wealthy

Tax cuts are another of Trump's proudest achievements. In 2017, the top individual tax rate was cut from 39.6% to 37% until 2025, while corporate taxes were reduced permanently from 35% to 21%. Prakken said the cuts had helped boost the stock market by 5-7% but had also led to a ""significant increase in the US budget deficit with potential negative long-run implications for the US standard of living.""

In a report shortly after the tax package went into effect, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center wrote that the top 20% of Americans enjoyed more than 60% of Trump's tax savings. Economists said any boost to consumer spending and business investment was shortlived and that little of the benefit had trickled down to low-income Americans. Despite this, Trump has promised to make the individual tax cuts permanent if reelected and plans to slash payroll taxes.

'Free and fair' trade deals

Trump has often stressed his ""America First"" trade stance — including the levying of billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs with China — which he said had gained an unfair advantage over the US. The president insists his policies have pressured multinationals to bring jobs back home and forced other nations to open their restricted markets to US firms. The tax cuts provided further encouragement, he said.

""Tariffs on China haven't done much for the manufacturing sector, but have undercut farm income,"" Prakken told DW, adding that there hasn't been a notable shift in direct foreign investment coming into the US from Trump's policies, while thousands of American farmers went out of business when Beijing restricted US agricultural imports.

In July, NAFTA 2.0 — an update of the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico — came into force. But despite promises that it would bring 180,000 new US jobs, the trade deal has no provision to stop work being outsourced to low-cost Mexico. Car manufacturers have continued to relocate their US plants across the border.

Election research shows that economic development just before the election can be decisive, says Prakken. ""Most models of the economy's impact on US presidential elections stress the role of [low] unemployment and income growth 6-9 months before the election.""

After the coronavirus lockdown in the spring that saw a record 40 million layoffs, Trump had hoped for a quick recovery of the US economy. And indeed, many economic indicators pointed up again in the summer.

In the meantime, however, the number of infections has risen to new record levels. This week for the first time there were 70,000 new cases within 24 hours. All of this endangers the slight summer recovery. For Trump an election day in early November, in the middle of the next wave of the coronavirus pandemic, is just a bit too early."

If you look deeper into 2019’s economic numbers an encouraging trend has emerged. The Trump economy, particularly after passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, has seen great increases in opportunities and prosperity for American women.

Women’s participation in the workforce today is steadily increasing.

Women’s wages are rising at a faster percentage rate than men.

Women of color are winning the jobs race.

As Reuters noted, “A tight U.S. labor market and booming demand in industries with an abundance of female workers is drawing more women back into the workforce, helping to shrink the longstanding gap in the labor participation rate between men and women to the narrowest on record.”

The Wall Street Journal also reported, “The share of women on payrolls, excluding farmworkers and the self-employed, exceeded the share of men in December for the first time since mid-2010, Labor Department data released Friday showed. Women held 50.04% of jobs last month, surpassing men on payrolls by 109,000.”

GREATER INCREASES IN WAGES FOR WOMEN:

Women have seen a much larger jump in wages than men since the start of the Trump Administration, and nearly three times as much since the second quarter of 2019. This is according to the weekly earnings numbers released by BLS on October 16. Overall men and women have seen nominal increases in their usual weekly earnings over the last quarter, year, and since the enactment of Tax Reform and the beginning of the Trump Administration. Here are the numbers:

THE JOBS RACE IS BEING WON BY WOMEN OF COLOR

With a record number of job openings, women of color have been experiencing the greatest increases in opportunity.

The New York Times reports “…Hispanic women have emerged as the biggest job market winners in an economy that has now grown for 121 straight months, assuming data released in coming months confirms continued growth. Employment rates for Hispanic women between 25 and 54, prime working years, have jumped by 2.2 percentage points since mid-2007, the eve of the Great Recession. That’s the most of any prime-age working group. Black women came in second, adding 1.6 percentage points.”

The bottom line: A pro-growth agenda of tax cuts and regulatory reform have led to a record jobs boom, and women are seeing the biggest gains in the Trump economy. Republicans will continue to push for this growth to continue, starting with passing USMCA without delay – which is expected to add another 176,000 jobs to the U.S. economy."

Behind closed doors, President Trump — concerned with the sagging economy — has sought a strategy for resuming business activity by May 1, according to people familiar with the discussions.

In phone calls with outside advisers, Trump has even floated trying to reopen much of the country before the end of this month, when the current federal recommendations to avoid social gatherings and work from home expire, the people said. Trump regularly looks at unemployment and stock market numbers, complaining that they are hurting his presidency and reelection prospects, the people said.

Like others, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions.

Trump said at his daily briefing Thursday that the United States was at the “top of the hill” and added, “Hopefully, we’re going to be opening up — you could call it opening — very, very, very, very soon, I hope.”

Multiple Cabinet secretaries in recent days have publicly expressed hope that the various government orders directing residents to stay at home and forcing nonessential businesses to close could at least be partially eased next month.

Asked Thursday during an appearance on CNBC whether he thought it was possible that the country could be open for business next month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said, “I do.” A day earlier, Attorney General William P. Barr had called some of the stay-at-home orders and other restrictions “draconian” and suggested that they needed to be reevaluated next month.

“When this period of time, at the end of April, expires, I think we have to allow people to adapt more than we have, and not just tell people to go home and hide under their bed, but allow them to use other ways — social distancing and other means — to protect themselves,” Barr said on Fox News.

The White House cannot unilaterally reopen the country. Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued federal guidance advising people to avoid social gatherings, work from home and use pickup and delivery options for food, it is state officials who have put the force of law behind those suggestions.

The CDC guidance is set to expire April 30, but the states are free to choose their own paths. Already, the state directives have varied in timing and in severity, and that is certain to continue as they are rolled back.

White House advisers have contemplated scenarios in which some “hot spot” states will not be ready to reopen as quickly, the people familiar with the matter said. There have already been vigorous debates, with public-health experts and some presidential advisers warning against reopening too soon, while key members of the president’s economic team — and some conservatives in the vice president’s orbit — push for a quicker return to normality.

Among those pushing to reopen the economy, according to senior administration officials, is Marc Short, the vice president’s chief of staff and a top adviser to Trump. Short has argued there will be fewer deaths than the models show and that the country has already overreacted, according to people with knowledge of his comments.

Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top expert on infectious diseases, said Thursday that some places might reopen sooner than others, and that hard-hit New York, for example, shouldn’t loosen its restrictions until there was a “very steep decline” in infections.

“It’s not going to be one size fits all,” he said.

The president, said one senior administration official with direct knowledge of the conversations, asks regularly: “When can we reopen?”

Health experts say that ending the shutdown prematurely would be disastrous because the restrictions have barely had time to work, and because U.S. leaders have not built up the capacity for alternatives to stay-at-home orders — such as the mass testing, large-scale contact tracing and targeted quarantines that have been used in other countries to suppress the virus.

Even one of the most optimistic models, which has been used by the White House and governors, predicts a death toll of 60,400, but only if current drastic restrictions are kept in place until the end of May.

There have been nascent signs that the aggressive social-distancing measures imposed by state and city governments have slowed the spread of the infection, which has killed more than 16,000 Americans. Federal officials have noted that Washington state and California were among the first states to see cases of the virus but have not experienced the high levels of infection and death that others, such as New York and New Jersey, are enduring. Pence said Thursday that officials were beginning to see “stabilization” in some of the hardest-hit areas.

“It’s working, America,” Pence said.

New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said Thursday that hospitalizations and intensive-care admissions in the state have fallen, suggesting progress. But he stressed that he did not know when New Yorkers would be able to begin a return to normal life.

“We’re not going to go from red to green; we’re going to go from red to yellow,” Cuomo said.

Trump aides internally have taken note of New York’s stabilizing hospital numbers, and some believe that the modeling projections are excessive.

The comments from Barr, who is not a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, and Mnuchin, who is, seem to indicate the growing recognition in the administration that the steps meant to stem the spread of coronavirus have inflicted economic pain that is likely to last for many months.

On Thursday — as the Labor Department tallied another 6.6 million Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said the U.S. economy was deteriorating “with alarming speed” and called for a national discussion about what will be required to reopen it.

Trump is preparing to announce this week the creation of a second, smaller coronavirus task force aimed specifically at combating the economic ramifications of the virus, according to people familiar with the plans.

The task force is expected to be led by Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and include Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic adviser, and Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, along with outside business leaders. Others expected to play a role are Kevin Hassett, who has been advising Trump on economic models in recent weeks, and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, administration officials say.

Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who advises the administration informally and has pushed for the country to reopen more quickly, said he believed the task force was a good idea to help expedite that process.

“You have to figure out: How do you do it? Where do you it? When do you it? What areas of the country? What industry?” Moore said. “His presidency depends on getting that right.”

Barr, the country’s top law enforcement official, noted that the economics of the shutdown could cost lives. For example, he said, cancer researchers were probably at home, not doing their critical work.

“We will have a weaker health-care system if we go into a deep depression,” Barr said. “So, just measured in lives, the cure cannot be worse than the disease.”

Barr’s comments came in response to repeated questions from Fox News’s Laura Ingraham about the civil liberties problems created by government-imposed shutdowns.

Barr, a person familiar with his thinking said, has known Ingraham for many years and agreed to the interview some time ago.

The attorney general repeatedly lauded Trump and said states were, at least for now, within their rights to impose such measures. The person familiar with his thinking said he was focused on what happens after the CDC’s guidelines on social distancing expire this month.

The person said Barr has been informally talking with associates about how businesses could reopen, including having more equipped with personal protective equipment or on-site testing.

“He was trying to say once we’re through this period, it’s not sustainable to live in fear,” the person said.

Health experts and economists have said that reopening prematurely could backfire and lead to another shutdown if coronavirus cases begin surging again and a long-term solution is not found. Past pandemics have offered clear warnings of what can happen.

A 2007 study funded by the CDC examined the fate of several U.S. cities when they eased restrictions too soon during the 1918 flu pandemic. Those cities believed they were on the other side of the peak, and, like the United States today, had residents agitating about the economy and for relaxing restrictions.

Once they lifted the restrictions, however, the trajectory of those cities soon turned into a double-humped curve with two peaks instead of one. Two peaks means overwhelmed hospitals and many deaths, without the flattening benefit authorities were trying to achieve with arduous restrictions.

Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, notably did not advocate a May reopening, saying such steps were more likely after July. And even some close to Trump seemed wary of supporting an early date.

Pence on Thursday did not put a firm date on a possible reopening but said that the decision would be guided by medical experts and that Trump wanted it to be done “responsibly.”

“No one wants to reopen America more than Donald Trump,” Pence said.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said an early reopening was “an aspirational goal.”

“The real fear is that you do it too quickly and you create a spike in the disease, which is likely to come back in the fall,” Graham said. “It has to be a science-based assessment, and I don’t see a mass reopening of the economy coming anytime soon.”

Even some of those most affected by the economic downturn expressed fear of a premature return to work.

“If restoring the economy means restoring transit systems back to full-throttle schedules, before covid-19 is defeated, it’s just going to expose more transit workers to harm’s way, and it’s something we would not be in favor of,” said John Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union. “Public transit systems are the most effective disperser of the virus. An evil-genius engineer could not have engineered a better system than the New York City transit system to spread covid-19.”

Zack Hershman, 27, has been out of work since mid-March when he was laid off as a server at Suraya, a Middle Eastern restaurant in Philadelphia’s Fishtown neighborhood. The layoff was profoundly unsettling, he said, but he nonetheless commended his employers for leveling with the staff early on about why the closures were necessary.

“As much as I would love to get back to work,” he said, “it’s not the right thing to do long-term in terms of the safety of people working and eating at restaurants.”"

Easter is April 12, less than three weeks away.

Trump's remarks in a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" event at the White House came as more states imposed extreme measures, including shutting down businesses and ordering residents to stay home, to try to slow the spread of the disease.

""We're opening up this incredible country. Because we have to do that. I would love to have it open by Easter,"" Trump said.

""I would love to have that. It's such an important day for other reasons, but I'd love to make it an important day for this. I would love to have the country opened up, and rarin' to go by Easter.""

In a second interview with Fox that aired Tuesday afternoon, Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because ""Easter's a very special day for me.""

""Wouldn't it be great to have all the churches full?"" Trump asked. ""You'll have packed churches all over our country … I think it'll be a beautiful time.""

Trump added that ""I'm not sure that's going to be the day,"" but ""that would be a beautiful thing.""

At a press briefing Tuesday evening, Trump appeared to back off the idea even further. ""We'll only do it if it's good,"" Trump said, adding that he is ""very much in touch"" with White House experts. ""I just think it would be a beautiful timeline.""

""Our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening"" of the economy, Trump said in that presser. ""Every decision is grounded solely in the health, safety and wellbeing of our citizens.""

Medical experts had recoiled at Trump's suggestion that Americans could gather en masse amid the coronavirus outbreak.

""Obviously Trump is not rooted in reality,"" said Dr. Tina Tan, a board member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and a staff member at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

""This is the making of a major public health disaster. I am not sure where he is getting his information from, but it is extremely flawed,"" Tan said.

The number of people found to have COVID-19 has increased significantly in recent days, as testing kits have been made more available to states.

At least 46,500 cases of COVID-19, including 590 deaths, have so far been confirmed in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University.

With a growing number of Americans not willing to attend church, many churches have already canceled their in-person Easter services.

""Our current plan is to have Masses and other Holy Week liturgies celebrated privately by the priests, with no congregation present,"" a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York told CNBC.

The New York metro area has quickly become the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other tri-state officials banned large gatherings of people last week.

Medical experts, including the Trump administration's scientific point man in the crisis, Dr. Anthony Fauci, have strongly advocated restrictions on people-to-people contact, saying it's better to overreact now than to be sorry later.

""I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting,"" he told NBC last week.

Asked at the White House on Tuesday about the Easter timeline, Fauci said there could be flexibility in different areas of the country where coronavirus cases are less prevalent.

Fauci has been lauded across the aisle for his straight talk about the coronavirus, offering blunt risk assessments – even at times when Trump has downplayed the threat. Fauci was absent from the White House's most recent briefings on the virus, but appeared at the Tuesday evening briefing.

A senior administration official told CNBC that Fauci was at the White House on Monday and had numerous meetings with the coronavirus task force earlier Tuesday.

Fears about the coronavirus — and the impact of government containment efforts on businesses and workers — have prompted a dramatic surge in unemployment and have sent stocks spiraling down in recent weeks.

The White House and leading lawmakers are working long hours on Capitol Hill to hash out the final details of a massive stimulus bill that would offer relief to those affected by the virus. The stimulus package is expected to cost at least $1.5 trillion and could include direct cash payments to Americans and around $350 billion in relief for small businesses."

President Donald Trump says he wants the nation “opened up and just raring to go by Easter” – a date just more than two weeks away that few health experts believe will be sufficient in containing the spread of coronavirus.

Speaking during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday, Trump reiterated he was eager to see the nation return to normal soon, even as doctors warn the nation will see a massive spike in cases if Americans return to crowded workplaces or events.

“I give it two weeks,” Trump said earlier in the town hall, suggesting he was ready to phase out his 15-day self-isolating guidelines when they expire. “I guess by Monday or Tuesday, it’s about two weeks. We will assess at that time and give it more time if we need a little more time. We have to open this country up.”

But Trump said Monday that the health experts on his task force do not necessarily agree with his hope for a quick return to their jobs to boost the economy. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, are also sounding the alarm.

“There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus,” Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, tweeted Tuesday.

The White House’s coronavirus task force is receiving plenty of feedback from public health experts who are sounding the alarm over easing the social distancing guidelines next week, a source familiar with the matter said.

Although Trump has talked about reopening the country by Easter, the source said, the President hasn’t reached a final decision on exactly when the government’s guidelines would be relaxed to get the economy back up and running. Trump is hearing from advisers who are urging him to make Easter more of an “aspirational date,” the source added.

When Trump talked up the idea of packing churches on Easter, the source continued, the President knew it was more wishful thinking than a realistic goal.

“He was being himself,” they said.

At the moment, the source said the current thinking is that it’s unlikely Trump will relax the social distancing guidelines next week, when the current 15-day period for those measures is scheduled to come to an end. That kind of a move would likely spark fierce debate inside the task force, the source said.

‘A beautiful timeline’

Trump told reporters during the daily press briefing it was his idea – and not that of his medical experts – to suggest Easter, which falls on April 12, as a potential date by which the US would again be “raring to go.”

“We’ll only do it if it’s good. We’ll do large sections of the country,” Trump said, adding he would listen closely to recommendations from Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, two top medical experts on the White House coronavirus taskforce.

Asked who suggested the Easter date, Trump said it was him.

“I thought it was a beautiful time. A beautiful timeline,” he said.

Pressed whether it was based on data, he said: “It was based on a certain level of weeks from the time we started and it happened to arrive, we were thinking of terms of sooner. I’d love to see it come sooner.”

Fauci told reporters that while he met with Trump in the Oval Office Tuesday he emphasized the need to be “flexible” in determining a date for a bounce back.

“We just had a conversation with the President in the Oval Office. You can look at a date but you gotta be very flexible,” Fauci told reporters when asked what he thought of Trump’s timeline.

Fauci also said that parts of the country may be OK by Easter but added other places that are worsening would likely not be.

“Obviously, no one is going to want to tone down things when you see things going on like in NYC,” he said.

Health officials drafting plans

It’s a timeline that federal public health professionals are now drafting plans for, a senior federal health official involved in the coronavirus response told CNN on Tuesday.

The official told CNN that public health professionals are drafting options “to be able to allow people to take a step back” into society in certain areas. The official described a “rolling” response, with recommendations easing for different parts of the country at different times.

The source cautioned that this approach is not without risk, as it could mean sending people back to work or school.

“The response to this outbreak is going to be rolling with increased mitigation, and then we’ll see it back off, followed by another increase as the virus increases,” the senior official said, referring to epidemiological modeling data shared with response team members. “With that said, we have to be willing to tolerate some risk in order to mitigate the virus.”

Echoing members of the White House coronavirus task force, the official told CNN, “This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We can’t do what we’re doing now and think it’s sustainable. We have to allow for the variations [of the virus] moving across the country.”

One idea being discussed inside the task force is dramatically expanding self-testing for the coronavirus on a massive scale inside the country, the source familiar with the matter said.

That would provide public health experts with a wealth of data to make more informed decisions about restarting the economy. Under such a scenario, almost anybody with flu-like symptoms could be tested, giving the administration a better sense of where the coronavirus is impacting communities.

That obviously would take time. But the problem right now, they added, is that very little data is available due to the slow rollout of testing across the country.

Administration health experts have an understanding of what’s happening in New York, California and Washington state. But less is known about the state of the pandemic in areas where there aren’t any known outbreaks.

“We don’t have the testing to know what’s going on,” the source said.

Disagreement within the White House over Easter goal

Trump’s new Easter goal came hours after the New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that the state is expecting a height of coronavirus infections to come in two to three weeks.

In a separate Fox News interview later Tuesday, the President provided a little more reasoning behind his timeline.

“So, I think Easter Sunday, and you’ll have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time. And it’s just about the timeline that I think is right,” he said.

The administration’s social distancing guidelines recommend against gatherings of more than 10 people, and many places of worship have adapted with online services.

Trump did concede he wasn’t sure if that timing – just 19 days from now – would work.

“It gives us more chance to work on what we’re doing, and I’m not sure that’s going to be the day, but I would love to aim it right at Easter Sunday, so we’re open for church service and services generally on Easter Sunday,” he said. “That would be a beautiful thing.”

Birx, who serves as the White House coronavirus coordinator, was asked during the town hall whether she thinks an Easter deadline is realistic.

“A lot of what we’ve done is tackle this epidemic the way people said we should have tackled the flu in 1918,” Birx responded, adding that the President has asked the task force to use these two weeks “to get all the data from around the country.”

She also reasserted that “every American needs to continue the President’s guidelines for these next six or seven days.”

Despite announcing the new guidelines under the banner “The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America,” Trump seemed to distance himself from the practices during the town hall.

“Somehow, the word got out that this is the thing we are supposed to be doing,” he said, noting the country had “never done a thing like this before.”

“But we had to do it. It’s been very painful for our country and very destabilizing,” he said.

As his advisers prepare options for returning the country to work, Trump suggested that Americans would still be able to exercise good health practices while still returning to normal.

“We have to go back to work much sooner than people thought,” he said.

Trump again compared coronavirus to the flu and auto accidents, despite warnings from his health advisers that such analogies make little sense.

“We lose thousands and thousands of people to the flu. We don’t turn the country off,” he said, adding: “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents.”

Last week, Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said comparing coronavirus to auto accidents was a “false equivalency” and said it was important to “face the fact” that coronavirus is more lethal than the flu."

The bill is the latest effort by the federal government to help keep afloat businesses that have had to close or dramatically alter their operations as states try to slow the spread of the virus. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 U.S. workers.

Trump thanked Congress for “answering my call” to provide the critical assistance and said it was “a tremendous victory.” But easy passage of this aid installment belies a potentially bumpier path ahead for future legislation to address the crisis.

Trump said most of the funding in the bill would flow to small business through the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides money to small businesses to keep workers on their payroll.

WATCH: Stories from Americans struggling with the pandemic’s economic fallout

“Great for small businesses, great for the workers,” Trump said.

The measure passed Congress almost unanimously Thursday as lawmakers gathered in Washington as a group for the first time since March 27. They followed stricter social distancing rules while seeking to prove they can do their work despite the COVID-19 crisis.

Lawmakers’ face masks and bandannas added a somber tone to their effort to aid a nation staggered by the health crisis and devastating economic costs of the pandemic.

“Millions of people out of work,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 deaths, a huge number of people impacted, and the uncertainty of it all.”

Anchoring the bill is the Trump administration’s $250 billion request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses. This program provides forgivable loans so businesses can continue paying workers while forced to stay closed for social distancing and stay-at-home orders.

The legislation contains $100 billion demanded by Democrats for hospitals and a nationwide testing program, along with $60 billion for small banks and an alternative network of community development banks that focus on development in urban neighborhoods and rural areas ignored by many lenders. There’s also $60 billion for small-business loans and grants delivered through the Small Business Administration’s existing disaster aid program.

WATCH: Decades-old unemployment systems can’t handle record demand

Passage of more coronavirus relief is likely in the weeks ahead. Supporters are already warning that the business-backed Paycheck Protection Program will exhaust the new $250 billion almost immediately. Launched just weeks ago, the program quickly reached its lending limit after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help.

Pelosi and allies said the next measure will distribute more relief to individuals, extend more generous jobless benefits into the fall, provide another round of direct payments to most people and help those who are laid off afford health insurance through COBRA.

Democrats tried to win another round of funding for state and local governments in Thursday’s bill but were rebuffed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who says he’s going to try pump the brakes on runaway deficit spending. McConnell says he doesn’t want to bail out Democratic-governed states for fiscal problems that predated the pandemic, but there’s plenty of demand for state fiscal relief among Republicans, too.

After the Senate passed the bill Tuesday, McConnell said Republicans would entertain no more coronavirus rescue legislation until the Senate returns to Washington in May. He promised rank-and-file Republicans greater say in the future legislation, rather than leaving it in the hands of bipartisan leaders.

Pelosi attacked McConnell for at first opposing adding any money to his original $250 billion package and saying cash-strapped states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy, a move that they currently cannot do and that would threaten a broad range of state services. McConnell’s comments provoked an outcry — including from GOP governors — and he later tempered his remarks.

The four coronavirus relief bills approved so far by Congress would deliver at least $2.4 trillion for business relief, testing and treatment, and direct payments to individuals and the unemployed, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The deficit is virtually certain to breach $3 trillion this year.

Key Priorities: Economy

Joe Biden

Increase investments in American-made products and companies, pouring $400 billion into procurement and $300 billion into research and development, with the aim of creating 5 million new jobs.

Reverse Trump tax breaks to corporations and seek a higher minimum wage and expanded benefits for low- and middle-income workers.

Read details of Biden's plans below.

Donald Trump

Create 10 million jobs in 10 months, as well as 1 million small businesses.

Push American companies outsourcing jobs in China back to the United States to establish 1 million new domestic jobs.

Read details of Trump's plans below.

Biden's Plans For The Economy

The Democratic nominee's economic plans center on his Build Back Better framework, with planks on such areas as increasing domestic manufacturing and investing in clean energy.

Biden's ""Made in America"" plan stands as his economic nationalist alternative to Trump's ""America First"" policy. It would spend $400 billion in procurement, increasing the demand for American-made goods, as well as $300 billion in technological research and development. These investments would then go toward U.S. businesses that create products in fields including clean energy, cars, medicine, biotechnology, telecommunication and artificial intelligence.

The Biden campaign says the effort would generate 5 million jobs.

Biden also calls for the need to diversify the manufacturing and innovation industries by providing ""historic investments"" in communities of color as well as in cities and rural locations.

The Democratic nominee supports a $15 minimum wage, universal paid sick leave and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.

Biden also wants to do away with the Republican corporate tax cuts passed in 2017, vowing to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. It's part of his $4 trillion tax package that his campaign says wouldn't directly raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000.

Trump's Plans For The Economy

Trump touts the country's pre-pandemic economy, saying he's the candidate to get it back out of its deep hole.

In a list of agenda items for a second term, released in August, Trump's campaign said his priorities include creating 10 million jobs in 10 months and creating 1 million small businesses.

He supports enacting additional tax cuts and the expansion of the ""opportunity zones"" tax break, though he gives no estimate of by how much.

Echoing goals set during his first campaign and term in office, Trump calls for tax credits to businesses making American products. And he says he will continue to enact ""fair trade deals that protect American jobs"" and cut back on business regulations.

As part of his agenda on China, Trump wants to establish 1 million domestic jobs that were previously based in China and offer tax breaks for businesses to move jobs out of China and back to the U.S., focusing specifically on pharmaceutical and robotics companies that currently outsource jobs.

There are no details about these plans, apart from their inclusion on the agenda list.

The White House says it will not give federal contracts to companies that continue to manufacture products in China. The president signed an executive order in August that incentivizes federal agencies to domestically source their jobs instead of outsourcing them. Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at boosting domestic production, but critics say that loopholes have allowed government agencies to circumvent these ""made in America"" provisions.

33,Trump's Economy: 7 Broken Promises to Working Americans - Center for American Progress Action - Center for American Progress Action Fund,Trump's Economy: 7 Broken Promises to Working Americans - Center for American Progress Action  Center for American Progress Action Fund,"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FucHJvZ3Jlc3NhY3Rpb24ub3JnL2FydGljbGUvdHJ1bXBzLWVjb25vbXktNy1icm9rZW4tcHJvbWlzZXMtd29ya2luZy1hbWVyaWNhbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Center for American Progress Action Fund,"In 2016, Donald Trump vowed to champion forgotten Americans and take on the entrenched interests that he blamed for hollowing out the middle class. He categorically promised “no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid,” and he said he would stop Wall Street from “getting away with murder”; end the outsourcing of American jobs; insure everyone with lower health care costs; and close tax loopholes for people like himself and to focus tax relief on the middle class. Trump promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington.

In office, however, President Trump’s administration has broken each of these promises, betraying the people he said he would fight for. In virtually every policy sphere, his administration has favored powerful corporations and the wealthy at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans. Trump’s broken promises have had real-life consequences for American families: less economic security; lower wages; more expensive health care; greater threats to Social Security and Medicare; and a widening gap between working Americans and the wealthy and powerful.

As President Trump prepares to give his third State of the Union address, here are seven ways his administration has broken his core economic promises and how they have let down ordinary Americans.

1. The Trump administration has tried to take away health care after promising to fix it

Trump promised to cover everyone and make health care affordable. Instead, his administration has waged a relentless assault on Americans’ health care, driving up costs and leaving more people uninsured. After coming up one vote short of repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in Congress, the administration has sought to repeal the law through the courts, throwing the federal government’s weight behind a lawsuit seeking to strike down the entire ACA. The lawsuit has been called “absurd” and “ludicrous” by diverse legal experts, but in December 2018, a Trump-appointed district judge agreed with it. His ruling was stayed, but the lawsuit continues and will likely be resolved by the end of the year.

If the Trump administration were to prevail in repealing the ACA:

Nearly 20 million Americans would lose health insurance coverage, resulting in a 65 percent jump in the number of uninsured.

Some 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions would lose critical protections.

The demand for uncompensated care—or the unreimbursed services provided by hospitals and health care providers that are paid for by federal, state, or local government programs or by health care providers—would increase each year by $50 billion, putting intense strain on rural hospitals and other providers.

12 million seniors would be forced to pay more for prescription drugs.

People under the age of 26 would no longer be entitled to stay on their parents’ plan.

Preventative services for women, such as breast cancer screenings, domestic violence counseling, and pregnancy check-ins, could lose their status as “free of cost sharing” and become additional financial burdens for women.

Trump also said he would “get drug prices so far lower than they are right now,” specifically promising to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. But in office, he has threatened to veto a House-passed bill that could lower the cost of 250 of the most expensive drugs.

2. The Trump administration pushed through a tax plan favoring the wealthy and corporations after promising to help the middle class

In 2016, President Trump said that under his tax plan, “No one will gain more from tax cuts than low- and middle-income Americans.” He promised to close tax loopholes for people like him, claiming that his tax bill would “cost me a fortune.” Likewise, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promised “no absolute tax cut for the upper class.”

However, the Trump administration proceeded to ram through Congress a nearly $2 trillion tax giveaway heavily favoring corporations and the wealthy. Corporate tax revenue subsequently plummeted—with 91 Fortune 500 companies paying no federal income taxes at all in 2018—and Trump himself has likely seen his annual tax burden reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars.

Moreover, the promised trickle-down effects have not materialized: Business investment, which the Trump administration claimed was the key to increasing productivity and workers’ wages, has declined.

3. The Trump administration has targeted Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid after promising never to touch them

In 2016, Trump categorically promised no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. But his budgets have targeted all three programs, and in a recent interview, President Trump said that he is now contemplating what could be much deeper cuts to Social Security and Medicare after 2020.

The president’s most recent budget cuts $10 billion from Social Security Disability Insurance—a core component of Social Security and only a fraction of the $84 billion in proposed cuts to programs that support people with disabilities—and the administration is seeking to impose new obstacles for people claiming disability benefits. The Trump budget also proposes cutting roughly $600 billion from Medicare, and it would eviscerate Medicaid, cutting the program by more than one-third.

4. Trump’s erratic actions on trade and tariffs have only hurt workers and communities

In April 2016, Trump promised , “We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later.”

Yet the Trump administration has made only a modest update to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and has achieved almost none of the United States’ main objectives with regard to China, most importantly leveling the playing field for American workers. Meanwhile, American businesses and consumers are bearing the financial brunt of the Trump administration’s directionless trade war; this administration’s policies have actually caused a recession in U.S. manufacturing. Jobless rates are rising, and layoffs have continued and even accelerated in some Midwestern states. Farmers, too, are hurting from the trade war, with family farm bankruptcies rising 24 percent in 2019.

5. The Trump administration has sold out to Wall Street despite promises to the contrary

In 2016, Trump said he would take on Wall Street: “Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We’re going to tax Wall Street.” He promised to stop wealthy investment fund managers from “getting away with murder” by closing the infamous carried interest tax loophole.

But nearly immediately after his election, President Trump began filling his inner circle with Wall Street bankers. His administration has since begun to dismantle the regulations and safeguards on banking that Congress implemented in the wake of the crisis of 2008. By undermining Obama-era rules, the Trump administration has left retirees and investors more vulnerable to rip-offs. Meanwhile, the six biggest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Morgan Stanley—for the first time saw more than $100 billion in profits in 2018 after already received a staggering $32 billion in tax cuts from the tax law signed by President Trump in 2017. The Trump administration also bowed to lobbyists on the carried interest loophole, which is still being exploited by wealthy fund managers to avoid taxes.

6. The Trump administration has allowed America’s infrastructure to deteriorate

President Trump promised to “rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.” He tweeted, “The only one to fix the infrastructure of our country is me – roads, airports, bridges. I know how to build, pols [politicians] only know how to talk!”

But those words have not translated into action. Despite bipartisan support for infrastructure, Trump’s administration failed to put forward a real plan to address American’s crumbling roads and bridges, which by some estimates will cost the United States $4 trillion in lost output between 2016 and 2025. Meanwhile, each passing day only compounds the need to repair and update the country’s infrastructure, which will soon cost some $4.5 trillion.

7. The Trump administration has brought in record numbers of corporate and industry lobbyists at the expense of the American people

After famously promising to “drain the swamp,” President Trump brought in “staggering” numbers of corporate lobbyists and tapped them to oversee the very industries from which they came. Turning over the reins of government to corporate lobbyists has resulted in serious consequences for the American people. Among many other special interest giveaways, the Trump administration has:

Undermined wage theft enforcement, making it more difficult to prosecute against employers who steal from employees—a problem that costs workers more than $50 billion annually.

Let companies force workers into mandatory arbitration agreements, which has left 60 million workers unable to bring class-action lawsuits to workplace disputes.

Allowed companies to classify certain workers as “independent contractors” to exclude them from federal labor law protections.

Began to dismantle environmental protections that keep air, water, and the environment clean while undermining communities’ input on projects in their backyards.

Propped up for-profit colleges, where students are four times more likely than students who attend not-for-profit colleges to default on loans and where 88 percent of borrows have debt upon graduation—a rate higher than both public and nonprofit schools.

Conclusion

President Trump has broken his promises to American workers, seniors, consumers, and families time after time—and he will continue to do so. The fundamental fact underlying Trump’s presidency is his consistent betrayal of working Americans, despite promises to the contrary. Trump will no doubt try to use the State of the Union address to gloss over the economic insecurities felt by most Americans, but it is becoming increasingly clear that his administration is looking out for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Americans.

But Trump retains some important advantages, like more Americans believing he is the better candidate to lead the economy, which ranked as their top voting priority.

In a head-to-head match-up between the two major party candidates, Biden holds a double-digit lead over Trump, with 52 percent of registered voters supporting the Democratic candidate and 42 percent backing the Republican incumbent. When matched against third-party candidates, both Biden and Trump lose some registered voters, but Biden remains ahead at 49 percent over Trump’s 41 percent. Five percent of voters would pick Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen if given the option, and 2 percent would pick Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins, who is on the ballot in some states. In poll after poll since February, Biden leads Trump among registered voters, according to PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist data.

“There’s no question that Biden’s ahead at this point,” said Barbara Carvalho, who directs the Marist Poll.

But Trump still enjoys greater enthusiasm than his Democratic opponent — 79 percent of those who say they plan to vote for him are doing so because they support him, while 17 percent say it’s because they are against Biden. People who plan to vote for Biden are more evenly split in their reasoning, with 49 percent explicitly supporting him and 46 percent motivated more by voting against Trump.

“There’s no question that Biden’s ahead at this point.”

With Trump’s overall disapproval rating hovering at 53 percent — it hasn’t dropped below 50 percent since June 2019 — U.S. adults said Biden would do a better job as president on some of the issues most important to them, including COVID-19, where Biden has a 13-point lead on the president, and race relations, where Biden has a 21-point lead Asked what single issue matters most to them, 13 percent said the coronavirus, 11 percent said climate change (the most important issue among Democrats), while health care and race relations tied at 8 percent.

The greatest number, 20 percent, named the economy as their top issue, which was also the most important issue to Republicans. Facing a historic recession, half of Americans see Trump as a more effective leader on that issue, while another 43 percent favor Biden. That opinion gap has widened for Trump since August, when 47 percent of Americans thought he would better handle the economy. That support comes despite the economy faltering and the nation falling into the worst recession in decades under Trump’s leadership. For much of his presidency, Trump has portrayed himself as a leader who can produce a healthy economy, pointing to low unemployment numbers and record-high stock indexes, while also engaging in trade wars with China and other nations that have negatively impacted farm incomes, manufacturers and more.

Americans are split on who they think would do a better job leading on crime, with Biden showing a slight edge. That’s despite Trump’s aggressive strategy to position himself as the law and order candidate amid national demonstrations on racial justice and police brutality against Black Americans.

Coming out of 2019, things were looking up for Trump, political historian Allan Lichtman said, with a strong economy as the crown jewel for his reelection campaign.

“Everything changed in America in 2020,” Lichtman said. With a pandemic, a wounded economy that could plague the country for years and social and racial unrest, Lichtman, who has accurately forecasted the results of every presidential election since 1984, including Trump’s win in 2016, said his measures suggest Trump will lose this election.

2020 election security

After multiple investigations into the Trump administration’s ties to Russian election interference, and Trump himself suggesting he may question the integrity of the 2020 election, Americans’ belief that the country is ready to hold the next presidential election has remained resilient at 53 percent since January. Another 41 percent of U.S. adults say the country is not as prepared as it should be. That faith grows when people are thinking about their own state and local election boards: 69 percent of Americans feel very confident that the 2020 elections will be conducted fairly and accurately.

But the pandemic has thrown more confusion into the process, with fears about contracting the coronavirus at crowded polling stations driving many Americans to seek alternatives to voting in person on Election Day, such as voting by mail. Fifty-two percent of Americans say they feel confident that the U.S. Postal Service will deliver election-related mail to voters and election officials on time this year, despite turmoil over reported mail delays and Trump’s own efforts to discredit the method.

Registered voters are still more likely to vote in person on Election Day than by alternative means, with 46 percent saying they plan to do so, including 62 percent of Republicans and 45 percent of independents. Another 35 percent of voters plan to vote by mail or absentee ballot, an option preferred by half of all Democrats. An additional 14 percent of voters said they will go to an early voting location.

Earlier this month, Trump encouraged North Carolina voters to attempt to vote multiple times, both by mail and in person to ensure their votes were counted. As the North Carolina State Board of Elections said in a released statement, voting twice in an election is a criminal offense. On Thursday, Trump tweeted, without evidence, sentiments that have become a common refrain for the president: “Unsolicited Ballots are uncontrollable, totally open to ELECTION INTERFERENCE by foreign countries, and will lead to massive chaos and confusion!”

Twitter flagged Trump’s tweet with data and resources that show “voting by mail is legal and safe.”

Virtually no historical precedent exists for Trump’s calls for voter fraud in North Carolina, or his overall campaign to sow doubt about the 2020 election, said Jeffrey Engel, who directs the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. The closest the nation has come was when Southern states refused to include Abraham Lincoln’s name on the 1860 presidential ballot, he said.

Trump’s behavior “crosses an invisible but critical red line of delegitimizing the outcomes of the election,” Engel said. “Presidents haven’t done that.”

That’s reflected in the 51 percent of Americans who say Trump is encouraging election interference, including 91 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents. Another 38 percent of Americans believe, though, that Trump is making elections safer, including 84 percent of Republicans.

Coronavirus and trust

Going into the final stretch of his reelection bid, Trump has tried to stir optimism about the outlook for the coronavirus pandemic, even when top infectious disease experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, paint a different picture. On Wednesday, Trump claimed that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield was “confused” after Redfield testified to a Senate committee that any coronavirus vaccine was unlikely to be widely available for most Americans until spring or summer 2021. Redfield did not retract his statement.

A new book from journalist Bob Woodward revealed last week that Trump has said he knowingly played down the severity of the virus back in February. Meanwhile, the U.S. is approaching 200,000 deaths tied to the virus, while life for many remains disrupted by jobs lost, income gone and food and housing uncertain in many parts of the country.

Erosion of trust could be influencing the public’s willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

“I really do believe we’re rounding the corner,” Trump told reporters gathered on Sept. 10 at the White House.

Most Americans don’t share Trump’s optimism. More than two-thirds of U.S. adults — 69 percent — said that they think it’s going to be at least six months before daily life gets back to normal. That includes 86 percent of Democrats, 73 percent of independents and 48 percent of Republicans.

Mixed messages from the Trump administration and leading public health officials have made it difficult for Americans to know who to trust for information about the pandemic. Trump’s word garnered the least amount of confidence, with only a third of Americans saying they trust what he has to say about the virus. Confidence has also slipped substantially when it comes to the news media, state and local government officials, and even public health experts. The last group still conjures the greatest amount of trust, among 69 percent of Americans, but that’s down from 84 percent in March.

Erosion of trust could be influencing the public’s willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The number who said they would get the vaccine has dropped from 60 percent of Americans in August to 49 percent today, with 61 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of Republicans prepared to roll up a sleeve.

Misinformation and anti-vaccination talking points that cast doubt on the entire scientific method have been applied to this virus, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies infection and immunity at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. That misinformation has compromised many people’s understanding that science is credible, she said, so people are losing faith in fundamental elements of public health.

“People don’t know what to think,” Rasmussen said. “They don’t know if it’s going to be reliable or not. It’s going to make a lot of people who normally do get vaccinated skeptical of the process.”"

• Across a broad range of economic metrics, economic performance under Trump continued gains made during the final years under Obama. Charts below show the trendlines.

One of the biggest themes of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address — and one of the biggest themes of his reelection campaign — is that he inherited a weak economy from President Barack Obama and turned it into a strong economy by implementing his own policies.

""The years of economic decay are over,"" he told the joint session of Congress on Feb. 4, 2020. ""The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone, too, are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power and prestige.""

Trump added, ""If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.""

When we reached out to the Trump campaign, they offered several statistics showing Trump has notched greater gains than Obama did, such as manufacturing job creation, the unemployment rate, and economic growth. We found those statistics, and other specific facts Trump cited during the State of the Union, were accurate, or largely so.

However, unlike Obama, who inherited the Great Recession, Trump inherited an economy that was already getting back on its feet. Overall, we found a continuation of the favorable trend lines Trump inherited from Obama.

We looked at 15 common economic statistics, from unemployment rates to growth in gross domestic product to poverty, foreclosures, and bank failures.

They cover the period of the Great Recession until today. Where possible, we’ve highlighted periods under a Republican president in red and periods under a Democratic president in blue.

The bottom line: For virtually each of these measurements, we found that the trend lines continued almost seamlessly from the second half of Obama’s presidency into the first three years of Trump’s tenure. Trump’s claim that he turned around a failing economy is wrong.

""I do not think economic gains have been any faster or better under Trump than gains we would have forecast based on the steady improvements we saw in the economy and job market in President Obama’s second term,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.

Also, no president has total control over the factors affecting the economy. Broader trends beyond their powers — from international economic conditions to technological changes — shape the course of the economy as well.

""All our decisions together produce the economy,"" said Aaron Sojourner, a University of Minnesota economist. ""It doesn't change when the resident of the White House does.""

Employment statistics

For unemployment rates and for median weeks of unemployment, the declines under Obama were at least as fast — if not faster — than they have been under Trump. That holds for several of the racial and ethnic groups Trump often cites in speeches, as well as for women.

Meanwhile, since the recovery gained speed, the pattern of monthly job gains has been quite similar under both Obama and Trump. That’s also broadly true for manufacturing job gains, a metric that Trump has been especially focused on.

The percentage of Americans either working or looking for work took longer to recover than other statistics, and it still hasn’t returned to pre-recession levels. This statistic did fall for most of Obama’s tenure, but it started to rise in his final year and has continued to rise under Trump.

Wages

Inflation-adjusted wages fell for much of Obama’s first term, but they began rising again during his second term. Their path under Trump has been along much the same trajectory.

Gross domestic product

As a candidate, Trump promised 4% economic growth. But he’s never hit that mark in any quarter (Obama did so in four quarters) and he has hit 3% in four quarters, the same number that Obama did during an equivalent period, his final three years in office.

Poverty and food stamps

The poverty rate and food stamp use has declined under Trump. Those declines began during Obama’s final years in office.

Credit and banking

The big declines in foreclosures, bankruptcies and bank failures occurred under Obama, with marginal advances under Trump.

The stock market

Trump often touts how the stock market has risen on his watch, and it has, to record levels. But a look at the Standard & Poor’s 500, a broad measure of stock market value, shows that the markets have risen at roughly the same rate under both presidents.

Consumer confidence

Trump may have his strongest argument on the most intangible of these statistics: consumer confidence.

Regular measurements by Gallup and the University of Michigan show a ""breakpoint right after the election"" in Trump’s favor, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com. In Gallup’s measure, for instance, the statistic broke into positive territory with Trump’s election and has stayed there, after being in negative territory for virtually all of Obama’s tenure.

""Multiple economic confidence measures took an immediate and sustained jump after the election, even though it's hard to find similar shifts among the key measures of actual economic performance,"" Kolko said.

But another widely tracked statistic, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, shows a continuing rise during Obama’s full tenure that presaged the later heights Trump reached.

Our ruling

Trump said that ""years of economic decay are over"" because he ""reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration.""

The notion that the economy turned on a dime from bad to good under Trump is not supported by the facts. The performance under Trump has generally continued the pace of improvements that began during the final few years of Obama’s presidency.

We rate the statement False."

Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

The public’s views of the nation’s economy remain more positive than at any point in the past two decades. In addition, more Americans say President Trump’s policies have made the economy better (44%) than worse (29%), while 26% say they have not had much effect.

The public’s ratings of economic conditions turned much more favorable shortly after Trump took office in 2017, as a result of a surge in positive views among Republicans. These attitudes have shown little change more recently.

Today, 57% of Americans rate the national economy as excellent (16%) or good (42%). This is virtually unchanged from last September, when 56% of the public held positive views of the economy. A third of the public views economic conditions as only fair; just 9% say the nation’s economy is in poor shape.

The national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Jan. 6-19 among 12,638 adults, finds that views of the economy – and the impact of Trump’s policies – continue to be deeply divided along partisan lines.

Currently, 81% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is excellent or good. These views have changed only modestly over the past two years. But between November 2016 (just before Trump’s victory in the presidential election) and March 2017 the share of Republicans with a positive view of the economy approximately doubled, from 18% to 37%. And by November 2018, they had doubled again, to 75%.

By contrast, Democrats’ assessments of economic conditions have changed only modestly since before Trump took office. Currently, 39% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say conditions are excellent or good. In November 2016, 46% had a positive impression of the economy.

Overall, the public holds more positive than negative views about the impact of Trump’s economic policies. While 44% say that the president’s economic policies have made economic conditions better, 29% say they have made the economy worse; 26% say Trump’s policies have not had much of an effect.

Views of the nation’s economy 1992-2020 In recent years, Pew Research Center has transitioned from probability-based telephone surveys to the American Trends Panel, a probability-based online panel. The transition from phone surveys conducted with an interviewer to online self-administered surveys brings with it the possibility of mode differences – differences arising from the method of interviewing. Over the last several years, the Center has tracked perceptions of economic conditions on both telephone and web surveys. Mode differences in perceptions of the economy are fairly modest. In the January survey conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, on which this report is largely based, 57% say the economy is excellent or good; 33% say economic conditions are only fair, while 9% say they are poor. In a contemporaneous telephone survey, conducted Jan. 8-13 among 1,504 adults, 51% say conditions are excellent or good, 34% say they are only fair, while 14% say they are poor. And in the summer of 2019, 57% rated economic conditions positively on the ATP, while 55% did so on a phone survey conducted a few weeks earlier. Partisan differences in positive perceptions of the economy are about as wide on the online panel survey (42 percentage points) as on the telephone survey (45 points). Both Democrats and Republicans are somewhat more likely to express positive views of the economy on the telephone survey as online. (For more on the transition from telephone surveys to online panel surveys, see “Trends are a cornerstone of public opinion research. How do we maintain them when there’s a shift in survey mode?”)

Public views of how Trump’s policies have affected the economy are more positive than they were for Obama’s policies at the same point in his presidency, when overall assessments of the economy were much more negative than they are currently. In February 2012, roughly equal shares said Obama’s economic policies had made things better (33%) and worse (35%); 25% said they had not had much effect. At that time, only 11% of the public rated the economy as excellent or good, with overwhelming majorities of both Democrats (84%) and Republicans (94%) rating the national economy negatively.

However, optimism that conditions would improve was relatively high eight years ago. Today, public outlook for the economy a year from now is mixed: Currently, 29% of Americans say conditions will be better, 26% worse, while 45% say they will be about the same as now. In February 2012, 44% expected economic conditions to improve; just 10% said they would get worse, while 42% said they would be about the same as they were then.

Opinions about the impact of presidents’ policies and the future course of the economy also are highly partisan. In the current survey, an overwhelming share of Republicans (80%) say Trump’s policies have made economic conditions better. Democrats are divided: Nearly half (48%) say Trump’s policies have had a negative impact, 38% say they have not had much of an effect and 14% say they have helped the economy.

Views about the state of the economy a year from now are somewhat less partisan, but while nearly half of Republicans (46%) expect economic conditions in the U.S. to be better a year from now than they are today, just 15% of Democrats say the same.

Demographic differences in views of economy

Overall, 57% of Americans say current economic conditions are excellent or good, but these views vary across demographic groups: older people, those with higher incomes, men and whites are particularly likely to say the economy is in good shape, while these views are less widely shared among younger people, those with lower incomes, women, blacks and Hispanics.

These demographic gaps are little changed over the course of the last few years. Americans ages 65 and over are the most positive in their evaluations of the economy, with 70% saying it is in excellent or good shape. By comparison, about half of 18-29 year olds (47%) say the same. And while more than six-in-ten white people (64%) offer positive evaluations of the economy, that compares with roughly half of Hispanic people (49%) and just a third of black Americans (33%).

There is a 12 percentage-point gender gap in these views: 64% of men say the economy is doing well, compared with 52% of women. And while 64% of college graduates say economic conditions are excellent or good, 54% of those without a college degree say the same.

Views of the economy also differ starkly by income. Among those with annual family incomes of $100,000 or more, 72% have positive views of the economy, with one-quarter rating it as excellent. Roughly two-thirds of those who make $75,000-$99,999 (65%) and $50,000-$74,999 (64%) rate the economy as excellent or good.

However, less than half of those who make less than $30,000 (44%) rate the economy positively, with just 10% saying they rate the economy today as excellent.

Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, a large majority (81%) rate the economy as excellent or good. Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to view the economy positively: 88% do so, including 41% who say the economy is in excellent shape. Among moderate and liberal Republicans, 72% offer positive ratings, with 18% saying economic conditions are excellent.

Overall, 39% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rate the economy as excellent or good, and there are only modest ideological differences in these views.

While majorities of Republicans in all age groups offer positive ratings of the economy, older Republicans and Republican leaners are much more likely than younger Republicans to do so: 90% of Republicans ages 65 and older rate the economy positively, while 68% of those under 30 say the same.

Among Democrats and Democratic leaners there is only modest variation in these views by age, although Democrats 65 and older view the economy more positively than those under age 65 (47% vs. 37%).

In both parties, those with higher incomes and those with college degrees are more likely to say current economic conditions are excellent or good. And the partisan gap is similar across all educational and income levels. For instance, 89% of Republicans with a college degree rate the economy as excellent or good, compared with 47% of Democratic college graduates – a 42 point gap. Among those without a college degree, the gap is nearly identical (45 points).

Across income and partisan groups, high income Republicans are the most likely to see the economy as in excellent or good shape, while low income Democrats are least likely to say this. But partisanship is a bigger factor than income in these evaluations: In fact, Republicans with incomes of less than $30,000 (69%) offer significantly more positive ratings of the economy than Democrats with incomes of $100,000 or more (52%).

Views of economy, Trump strongly related

Opinions about the state of the nation’s economy are correlated with views of Trump’s job performance. People who have the most positive views of economic conditions – the 16% of adults who say the economy is excellent – overwhelmingly approve of Trump. Nearly nine-in-ten (86%) approve of his performance, including 76% who strongly approve.

Yet those who say economic conditions are good are not nearly as supportive of Trump. Half of this group approves of his job performance, with only about a third (36%) strongly approving.

In part, this reflects partisanship in views of both the economy and Trump. For instance, among Republicans who view the economy as good (half of all Republicans and leaners), 82% approve of Trump’s job performance. But among the roughly one third of Democrats who give the economy the same rating, only 11% approve of Trump’s performance.

Among the 15% of Republicans who rate conditions as only fair, a narrow majority (55%) approves of his job performance. Among Democrats who view the economy as only fair, just 4% approve of the job Trump is doing."

The economy is consistently a top voting issue. In a survey asking a similar, though not identical, list of issues in June 2016, the economy also was the top voting issue.

In the current survey, 68% of voters say health care is very important to their vote, while 64% cite Supreme Court appointments.

As the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus outbreak, 62% of voters say the outbreak will be a very important factor in their decision about who to support in the fall.

About six-in-ten (59%) say violent crime will be very important to their 2020 decision, and 57% say this about foreign policy.

Immigration and racial and ethnic inequality rank toward the lower end of the list for voters (52% each call these issues very important to their vote).

Fewer than half say climate change (42%) or abortion (40%) will be very important factors in their decision (though majorities say these issues will be at least somewhat important to them).

Trump and Biden voters diverge over importance of COVID-19 to their vote this fall

There are stark differences in how registered voters who support Donald Trump and Joe Biden view the importance of these issues. In fact, of 12 issues included, the only ones that comparable shares of Biden supporters and Trump supporters view as very important are foreign policy and Supreme Court appointments.

For Trump supporters, the economy (88%) and violent crime (74%) are the most salient issues. Roughly six-in-ten Trump supporters cite immigration (61%), gun policy (60%) and foreign policy (57%) as very important to their vote.

By contrast, the largest shares of Biden supporters view health care (84%) and the coronavirus outbreak (82%) as very important. A sizable majority also rates racial and ethnic inequality as important to their vote (76%).

While there are substantial differences between Trump and Biden supporters on the importance of most issues, the widest gaps are on climate change (57 percentage points) and racial and ethnic inequality (52 points).

In addition, Biden supporters are more than twice as likely than Trump supporters to say the coronavirus outbreak (82% of Biden supporters, 39% of Trump supporters) and economic inequality (65% of Biden supporters, 28% of Trump supporters) as very important.

Larger shares of Trump than Biden supporters say violent crime (74% vs. 46%), immigration (61% vs. 46%) and gun policy (60% vs. 50%) are very important to their decision about who to vote for in 2020.

Republicans lead on the economy; Democrats have advantages on climate, health, racial issues

Among registered voters, the Republican Party holds a 9 percentage point edge over the Democrats on the issue of being better able to handle the economy (49% Republican Party, 40% Democratic Party). And as has been the case for many years, more voters say the GOP could do a better job than the Democratic Party on terrorism (46% vs. 37%).

By contrast, the Democratic Party holds wide advantages among voters on climate change (58% to 27% over the GOP), abortion and contraception (51% to 36%) and health care (51% t0 37%). In addition, the Democratic Party has 12-point leads on handling the public health impact of the coronavirus and issues involving race and ethnicity.

On other issues, including immigration, gun policy, the federal budget deficit and law enforcement and criminal justice, neither party has a significant edge among voters."

Trump's four years in office already measure up as the biggest economic disaster for any U.S. president in modern times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

It didn't have to be this grim. Dozens of nations dealing with the same challenges are showing superior infection, death and unemployment rates and quicker business rebounds after shutdowns earlier this year. But Trump's disdain for antibody tests, contact tracing, social distancing and masks, among other prerequisites for containing the coronavirus, enabled the U.S. to lead the world in confirmed cases and deaths (though not in deaths per capita). Instead of peaking in late April with more than 30,000 daily new U.S. Covid-19 infections, the virus is resurgent in July — a stark contrast to such densely populated regions as Hong Kong, where Covid-19 retreated to insignificance within a month of its March high."

President Donald Trump has repeatedly pointed to the nation's steady economic health as the strongest indicator of his success throughout his time in the White House, calling it ""terrific"" and ""the greatest in the history of the country.""

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Trump credited his presidency with an unprecedented ""comeback"" for an economy that was in ""a dismal state"" when he first took office.

""The United States is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before,"" he said, according to The Washington Post.

He's also used his economic record as a shield to fend off Democratic-led impeachment proceedings that are now barreling towards a Senate trial. But how does it compare to that of his immediate predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush?

Presidents receive a lot of credit when the economy is performing well and a barrage of criticism when it doesn't, despite the fact they don't wield direct power over it.

Any number of factors can throw it out of balance, like the dotcom bubble bursting during Bush's first term, or the subprime mortgage crisis in the housing market that led to the Great Recession.

But a closer look at the Trump economy reveals a conflicting portrait — though it was certainly not in a poor state after the president's 2017 inauguration. The unemployment rate is ticking downward, and job growth is holding steady — but Trump's ongoing trade wars sapped business confidence. Companies have pulled back on hiring workers as a result.

Here are nine charts tracking the highs and lows of the Trump, Obama, and Bush economies on key indicators like gross domestic product, unemployment, wages, and the federal debt. As you can see, they paint a mixed picture around Trump's bold claims."
48,Fact check: How Trump's economy compares to Obama's - CNN,Fact check: How Trump's economy compares to Obama's  CNN,"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMC8wMi8xOC9wb2xpdGljcy90cnVtcC12LW9iYW1hLWVjb25vbXktZmFjdC1jaGVjay9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMC8wMi8xOC9wb2xpdGljcy90cnVtcC12LW9iYW1hLWVjb25vbXktZmFjdC1jaGVjaw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"Washington CNN —

A commemorative tweet from former President Barack Obama Monday touting the “longest streak of job creation in American history” on the 11th anniversary of the Recovery Act was met by an angry tweet from President Donald Trump attacking Obama’s record on the economy.

Trump tweeted: “Did you hear the latest con job? President Obama is now trying to take credit for the Economic Boom taking place under the Trump Administration. He had the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression, despite Zero Fed Rate & MASSIVE quantitative easing. NOW, best jobs numbers ever. Had to rebuild our military, which was totally depleted. Fed Rate UP, taxes and regulations WAY DOWN.”

While the economy has improved under Trump, the expansion began under Obama. Analysis of the economy should take into account all contributing factors, so it’s unfair to ascribe credit for economic growth or blame for economic problems solely to one President.

Here’s how the Trump administration’s economic accomplishments actually compare to Obama’s.

Economic recovery under Obama

Responding to Obama’s claim that the Recovery Act passed under his administration set the country on a path to economic success, Trump claimed Obama actually had “the weakest recovery since the Great Depression.”

At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN’s home for Facts First.

Facts First: If you look solely at the average rate of GDP growth, it’s true that that the economy recovered more slowly after the Great Recession than during previous rebounds. But growth hasn’t been exceptionally better under Trump.

Annualized GDP growth averaged about 2% after it bottomed out in 2009 through the end of Obama’s term. That’s far below the typical growth in rosy times of over 4% a year that the US has experienced since World War II.

Growth has ticked up slightly under Trump, to 2.5% during his first three years. That’s well below the 4% Trump had promised but a bit better than the 2.4% average growth rate during the last three years of Obama’s time in office.

Help from the Federal Reserve

With his comments about the “Fed Rate” being zero under Obama and up since his tenure, Trump is arguing that Obama got more help from the Federal Reserve in boosting the economy.

Facts first: It’s true that Fed policies helped the economy recover from the Great Recession under Obama, and while its key interest rate is higher now than it ever was under the previous president– it was cut last year for the first time since 2008.

The Fed kept the federal funds rate, its key interest rate, near zero during Obama’s two terms and purchased trillions of dollars in bonds, a policy known as quantitative easing – a tool the Fed used to help juice the economy from 2009 through 2014.

It didn’t start to raise rates again until December 2015 and then for a second time in a decade in December 2016 – at the end of Obama’s second term. It continued to raise the rate after Trump took office, increasing it seven times – until July 2019. Since then, the Fed has cut the rate three separate times. Currently, it’s at about 1.55%.

Jobs

Trump claimed the US now has the “best jobs numbers ever.”

Facts First: While the more than 6.6 million jobs created under the Trump administration thus far is commendable, it is not unique.

A gain of more than 6.6 million jobs during a 35-month period has been common during the 80 years that the Labor Department has counted jobs. More jobs were created in the 31 final full months of Obama’s presidency (6.91 million) than during the 31 first full months of Trump’s presidency (5.85 million).

The average monthly gain so far under Trump is 182,000 jobs. But during a comparable 36-month period at the end of Obama’s tenure, employers added 8.1 million jobs, or 23% more than what has been added since Trump took office, for an average monthly gain of 224,000 jobs.

It’s true that the job record under Trump so far is better than the job record during Obama’s first 35 months in office, but Obama inherited an economy in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. In comparison, Trump took office with a string of 76 straight months of job gains. Job creation under the Trump administration is a continuation of an improving job market, not the turnaround that occurred in the early years of the Obama administration.

Military spending

In his tweet, Trump said he had to rebuild the US military because it had been “totally depleted” under Obama’s tenure.

Facts First: It’s misleading for Trump to claim the military was “totally depleted” when he took office. While average defense spending per year has increased under Trump, the US spent around the same amount on the military over both Obama and Trump’s first three years in office respectively.

Although military spending decreased under Obama, this was largely due to the Budget Control Act, which passed in 2011 with Republican support and resulted in automatic spending cuts to the defense budget and other discretionary spending after a bipartisan committee failed to produce legislation that would decrease the deficit. Even still, the US spent well over $500 billion per year on the military every year of Obama’s tenure.

US military spending in 2016 was also higher than that of the next eight highest-spending countries combined, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks global defense issues."

President Donald Trump touts the economy’s quick recovery as evidence of his administration’s success. He’s not wrong, but it’s not the full picture.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spent all last week testifying about the recovery on Capital Hill. His message: This is a tale of two economies, and one looks much stronger than the other.

On paper, the economy is roaring back even stronger than Powell and many economists expected.: More than 22 million jobs vanished in the spring lockdown, but 10.6 million jobs have since been added back.

And US gross domestic product – the broadest measure of the economy – is expected to rebound sharply after collapsing at a revised, annualized and seasonally adjusted rate of 31.7% between April and June. The Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now model predicts GDP will jump at an annualized and seasonally-adjusted rate of 32% in the third quarter.

But that’s only one side of the story.

The other side

Many shops are still closed. About 11.5 million people who became unemployed because of Covid-19 remain out of work. And next week, unless Congress acts to provide more federal help, up to 100,000 airline industry jobs may be lost after the expiration of the CARES Act, which provided a $50 billion bailout to keep US airlines afloat.

Meanwhile, the sugar rush from Congress’s initial stimulus has worn off. Without more intervention we could be in for a long winter, especially as Covid-19 infections are rising again in some parts of the world.

“The risk going forward is that people are spending [now] because they have money in the bank even though they’re unemployed,” Powell said.

But once that money runs out, people might start scaling back their spending – a potential body blow to the recovery given consumer spending is the economy’s biggest engine.

Retail sales, one measure of how Americans’ spending behavior, have bounced back, recording their biggest monthly surge on record in May. But while the data has gotten better in the following months, the pace of improvement has slowed.

Fears of funds drying up

One possible reason is that unemployment benefits are now lower: a supplemental $600 in weekly jobless aid, part of Washington’s first stimulus bill, ran out at the end of July, and Congress hasn’t agreed on a new stimulus deal.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order to bolster benefits again, though by $300 a week this time, by diverting money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA said that some states have already exhausted their allocated amounts. (The President’s executive order provides a $300 weekly supplement to the jobless. States could opt to add an additional $100 a week, bringing it to $400.)

Meanwhile, businesses using the Paycheck Protection Program to make it through the worst months of the crisis are worrying about funds drying up.

Problems like these underscore the importance of Congress taking action – and soon.

“I do think it’s likely that additional fiscal support will be needed,” Powell reiterated before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, even though the recovery will ultimately depend on the path of the pandemic.

If Washington fails to agree on more stimulus the fourth quarter of this year, as well as 2021, could look much weaker than expected, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, in a note.

But now that lawmakers are more focused on approving a new US Supreme Court justice, worries are growing that no further stimulus will be passed until after the election.

Experts at Oxford Economics still believe a $1.5 trillion stimulus package could be agreed upon before the election on November 3.

But the window to get a deal done is closing fast and will require that rarest of commodities in Washington: compromise.

Update: This story has been updated with more details about how Americans can collect $400 a week in emergency jobless benefits."

Jobs data from May showed an uptick relative to the stupendous collapse seen in March and April, and so he and other Republican leaders declared victory. ""I think we're going to have a very good upcoming few months,"" he said on June 8.

But it's increasingly clear that the economy is stalling out again, and things are going to get much, much worse if Republicans continue to refuse to support an extension of super-unemployment and other pandemic relief. The relatively strong economy of 2019 is not coming back for a good long while because Donald Trump is an incompetent oaf who has failed spectacularly at his job.

An important question about the economic collapse caused by the pandemic is how much of it was caused by state rules closing down bars, restaurants, and so forth, and how much was down to citizens staying home of their own volition. Many conservatives have insisted it was entirely the fault of the government rules, and that we could simply fix the economy by shoving people back to work and pretending as if everything is fine. In National Review on May 20, Rich Lowry praised Florida governor Ron DeSantis for refusing to implement a strict lockdown.

Unfortunately, this just isn't true. A recent paper by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson examined county-level data to answer this question, and found that it was overwhelmingly the behavior of citizens that was responsible. ""While overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 percentage points of this. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection,"" they write. The same result can be seen abroad in Sweden, where the government largely avoided a full lockdown, yet still experienced about the same economic downturn as its neighbors that did close down.

Conversely, states that attempted to bull through with premature re-openings are now experiencing giant surges in new COVID-19 cases. Hospitals are quickly filling up with patients in Texas, Florida, and Arizona, and other states are not far behind. Many states have halted or reversed their re-opening plans, and indicators like restaurant attendance are once again falling, particularly in the hard-hit locations. In Houston, for instance, reservations had recovered to half their pre-pandemic level in early June, but have since fallen to just a quarter.

In sum, the coronavirus recession has been caused by the virus, not the state response to it. And because the pandemic is once again out of control, the economy can not possibly return to full employment and production. A recovery is therefore not structurally possible until we reach herd immunity or a vaccine is developed and deployed, which won't happen until early 2021 at the earliest. The jobs reports in June or July may or may not show a fall in employment, but sooner or later things are going to stall out far short of recovery.

This is mostly Trump's fault. As I and many others have argued over and over, it is possible to contain the virus. With a lockdown to contain the initial surge, then a test-trace-isolate program to catch new outbreaks before they spiral out of control, countries can return to something like normal life. Countries across the world have demonstrated that this can work — even ones that were caught napping and had very severe outbreaks, like Italy and Spain, have now almost completely contained the virus.

But Trump didn't do any of that. On the contrary, he had previously done spectacular damage to the effectiveness of the American administrative state through inattention and by stacking it with his idiot cronies, and straight-up deleted much of the pandemic control system that President Obama had set up. When the virus hit, he did basically nothing besides deny the U.S. was in danger, promise it would vanish on its own, and complain testing made him look bad. Now that we're in the middle of a second giant surge of cases, he still refuses to even urge people to wear a mask. He thinks it's a ""personal choice,"" per White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. His administration has also so far resisted further economic rescues, particularly extending super-employment. If that expires in July on schedule, the economy will plunge further.

For most of his presidency, polls have shown wide approval of Trump's economic performance, likely because unemployment happened to be at a 20-year low. Now that we're in the deepest recession since the 1930s, attitudes are souring — Gallup has his approval rating on the economy falling from 63 percent in January to 47 percent today. That is still remarkably high given his staggering incompetence and failure, but perhaps people are giving him the benefit of the doubt because other countries also struggled to contain the virus at first.

That may change as people begin to realize that America stands alone as the worst-performing rich nation by far. Where French and German folks have been increasingly going about their normal business for weeks, and New Zealanders are doing in-person sports again, it looks like Americans will not be able to congregate inside normally for the next six months at least. (Indeed, Americans are now banned from normal travel to the European Union, and rightly so.) As a result, our economy is going to remain in the toilet — with state income support needed simply to keep people from starving.

When you elect a narcissistic reality TV host to the presidency, this is what tends to happen.

Even America’s older adults would be left to figure out how to get by without heat, air conditioning or electricity.

This is the apocalyptic version of American life that President Donald Trump argues would be the dire consequence of turning over the White House to Democrat Joe Biden.

“He’ll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs,” Trump said in one of many over-the-top pronouncements about Biden in the campaign’s final weeks. Trump typically makes his warning about the fate of suburbia as he showcases his own decision to end federal regulations that govern the placement of low-incoming housing in the suburbs.

Campaign rhetoric can often become heated and hyperbolic as candidates scrap for every last advantage before the votes are counted.

Experts say instilling fear in one’s opponent is usually the primary motivating factor behind such talk as candidates seek to give voters a reason to put a checkmark next to their name on the ballot.

“It’s pure fear and fear based on a particular kind of ignorance that only works if your hearers have that particular kind of ignorance,” Robin Lakoff, professor emerita of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said of Trump’s claims about Biden.

Trump made fear — particularly the fear of immigrants — a major theme of his 2016 campaign. Now, he is giving voters a laundry list of mostly implausible reasons to fear a Biden presidency.

“This election is a choice between a TRUMP RECOVERY or a BIDEN DEPRESSION,” the president tweeted, echoing what he tells supporters at rallies. “It’s a choice between a TRUMP BOOM or a BIDEN LOCKDOWN. It’s a choice between our plan to Kill the virus – or Biden’s plan to kill the American Dream!”

Trump has criticized Biden for saying he’d follow the scientists, and the president claims the Democrat would shut the country down. In fact, Biden hasn’t said whether he’d endorse large-scale shutdowns of the nation’s economy, if things get drastically worse, like much of the country did in March.

“If you vote for Biden, it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas and no Fourth of July together,” Trump said at a rally Wednesday in Goodyear, Arizona. “Other than that, you have a wonderful life.”

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump’s rhetoric is effective with people who are already disposed to believe such things about Biden. But to a person who is not in the audience, she said, such talk is a “sign of desperation.”

“The problem with the rhetoric is it’s an alienating rhetoric for people who hear it as extreme and improbable,” Jamieson said. It’s also problematic, she said, “because you expect a president of the United States to calibrate his rhetoric to reality in at least some plausible way.”

Last week in Florida, Trump sought to boost his standing among older Americans angered by his response to the coronavirus by portraying Biden as the one who would do them harm. Trump falsely said Biden’s energy plan “would mean that America’s seniors have no air conditioning during the summer, no heat during the winter and no electricity during peak hours.”

During a summer of unrest that followed the police killings of Black men, Trump sought to portray Biden as beholden to the “radical-left” forces Trump claimed were behind the protests. He also argued that Biden wouldn’t be able to keep such unrest from spreading to the suburbs.

David Zarefsky, who teaches courses about presidential rhetoric at Northwestern, said close examination shows the weakness in Trump’s argument about Biden and the suburbs.

“I think most people would not put it together as being a sound argument,” said Zarefsky, a past president of the Rhetoric Society of America.

Leading Democrats have deployed their own dire talk.

In July, Biden said Trump was the country’s first racist president, which glossed over the presidents before Trump who had held slaves.

“We’ve had racists, and they’ve existed. They’ve tried to get elected president,” Biden said. “He’s the first one that has.”

And in his Democratic National Convention speech, former President Barack Obama said four more years of the Republican in the White House would jeopardize American democracy.

“That’s what’s at stake right now. Our democracy,” Obama said.

Jamieson said that claim is different because it is grounded in the president’s own norm-busting behavior, such as his attacks on the Justice Department and on the press, or his unfounded challenges to voting by mail and the legitimacy of Tuesday’s election.

“Those who are making the argument about Trump are offering evidence from his rhetoric and actions,” she said, adding that the attacks on Biden are “not justified by what he’s said or done.”

Vanessa Beasley, a professor of communication studies at Vanderbilt University, said all presidents fall back on “us versus them” rhetoric during campaigns, but that once in office the rhetoric is tempered by the reality of having to govern for all.

She cited Obama as an example, noting the disappointment among some of his supporters after he was elected and the aspirational “hope and change” rhetoric that helped power his political rise gave way to more measured discourse.

“The difference with Trump,” she added, “is that he never stops the ‘us versus them.’”

Beasley added that hyperbolic rhetoric can be optimistic, citing President Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America” campaign from the 1980s as a classic example.

“Hyperbole doesn’t always have to go to fear,” she said.

Yet the reality is that real wages were stagnant for working-class Americans, the country was already in a manufacturing recession, farm bankruptcies were at an eight year high, and job growth for President Trump’s first three years in office was 15 percent below Obama’s last three years in office. It is that economy that President Trump characterized as “record breaking” and the “greatest economy the world has ever seen.”

He is also asking Americans to treat the last six months, the most devastating and sudden recession in recorded history, as an asterisk to his record. But, the current recession is arguably more tied to his direct decisions than any recession in history. At every decision point, President Trump has taken positions that ensured this recession would be deeper and more prolonged. Every president faces profound tests, but none have failed theirs at the magnitude that he has.

The president has insisted that workers, families, and children risk their lives amidst a pandemic that he has let spin out of control, setting back economic recovery. He has refused to negotiate on a serious response to crush the virus and get our economy back on track. That means right now — in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression — jobless workers have seen their lifelines cut off, communities don’t have the resources they need to open schools safely or control the virus, and small businesses aren’t getting the help they need to survive.

So when President Trump talks about his record breaking economic performance, keep in mind these records. Every president owns their performance, and his excuse is only further condemnation.

Trump is the worst jobs president in recorded history, currently presiding over a loss of 6 million jobs from when he took over. In fact, he is on track to be the only president to have actually lost jobs over his term.

1.3 million fewer Black workers are currently employed than when Trump took office. No other president has presided over a net decrease in Black employment since at least before the Ford Administration, when this started to be tracked.

600,000 fewer Latino workers are currently employed than when Trump took office. Again, no other president has seen Latino employment drop over his presidency since at least the Ford Administration, when these records began to be kept.

U.S. GDP contracted at an annual rate of 31.7 percent in the second quarter of 2020 — the largest drop ever recorded.

The week ending March 28 saw close to 7 million Americans file for unemployment, the highest weekly number of unemployment claims in recorded history, reaching nearly seven times higher than the highest figure recorded before Trump’s presidency.

Mr Trump knows he is hyperbolising when he says that America has enjoyed “the greatest economy in the history of the world” on his watch, suggests Mr Mulligan, who was until recently the chief economist on the president’s Council of Economic Advisers. It is a “strategy for getting the press to cover a new fact, which is to exaggerate it so that the press might enjoy correcting him and unwittingly disseminate the intended finding”. Journalists’ dislike for Mr Trump, according to Mr Mulligan, blinds them to many of the administration’s genuine economic successes. He may have a point.

Assessing leaders’ economic records is fraught with difficulty. Presidents typically get credit when the economy is doing well and blame when it does badly—but short-term economic outcomes are usually more influenced by central banks, demography and what is happening in the rest of the world, among other factors. Even today, political scientists continue to argue over whether the economy in the 20th century did better under Democratic or Republican administrations. All this is of little use to the American public, whose vote for a president must be based, in part, on a real-time assessment of economic competence.

Mr Trump came to power with unrealistic promises to create 25m jobs and supercharge economic growth, and to that end cut taxes and boosted spending, widening the fiscal deficit (see chart 1). Economists will continue to weigh up the specific costs and benefits of those policies. A true evaluation will take some time. At present, however, it is possible to assess whether the American economy overall did better or worse under Mr Trump. That involves comparing actual American economic performance, on the one hand, with what an impartial spectator could reasonably have expected, on the other. To that end The Economist has gathered a range of economic data, from business investment to wage growth, wherever possible comparing American economic performance to that of other rich countries.

The bulk of the analysis covers the period from 2017, when Mr Trump took office, to the end of 2019. We stop in 2019 in part because some data are released only annually, and in part because the pandemic has turned economies across the world upside down. Our conclusion is that, in 2017-19, the American economy performed marginally better than expected. (That conclusion remains if we follow the practice of some political economists, who argue that the influence of presidents on the economy can be discerned only after a year in office, and limit our analysis to 2018-19.)

Take gross domestic product ( GDP ), a measure of output which is the most common yardstick of economic performance. GDP growth was somewhat faster in 2017-19 than it was in either Barack Obama’s first or second term, according to official data. America also did well relative to other countries. The world economy peaked in 2017. In 2018 it slowed but America accelerated. In 2019 America slowed too, but stayed ahead of others.

Another way to look at this question is to assess whether America in 2017-19 exceeded or fell short of economists’ expectations (see chart 2). In October 2012 the IMF forecast that in the subsequent four years (those of Mr Obama’s second term), the American economy would grow by an annual average of 3%. In fact that proved to be too optimistic; it actually grew by closer to 2% a year. But the IMF was too pessimistic in its projections for 2017-19, released shortly before the election of 2016. In those years America outperformed the forecasts.

But if the American economy did better than expected in some respects, it disappointed in others. Take the corporate sector, which Mr Trump helped with lighter taxes. Corporation-tax cuts did increase post-tax earnings, one reason why the American stockmarket has done relatively well since Mr Trump came to power (see chart 3). America has also become a more favoured destination for foreign direct investment (see chart 4). But there is little evidence of the promised business-investment boom (see chart 5).

America’s labour-market performance is similarly nuanced. Though Mr Trump particularly likes to boast about monthly employment figures, it is hard to make the case that in 2017-19 the jobs machine was whirring. Jobs growth was slower than it had been during Mr Obama’s second term. In 2009-16 America’s unemployment rate fell relative to the average for other G 7 economies (see chart 6). Under Mr Trump unemployment did fall to the lowest since the 1960s, but this was not internationally exceptional. America’s improvement relative to employment in other countries stopped under Mr Trump.

The lot of working-class Americans, however, definitely improved in 2017-19. Comparing household incomes between countries is difficult, certainly for recent years. But though there is some dispute about the reliability of the data gathered in 2020, where the pandemic made it difficult for researchers to conduct surveys, there is clear evidence of an acceleration in the growth of America’s median household income from 2017 onwards (see chart 7). A tight labour market also helped raise the wage growth of the lowest-paid Americans, relative to others, to a degree not seen since Bill Clinton was president (see chart 8).

And what of the economy in 2020? Mr Trump’s loose fiscal policy before the pandemic left America with much higher debt going into the crisis. On top of that splurge, this year America has implemented the world’s largest fiscal package (see chart 9), posting stimulus cheques worth up to $1,200 per person and temporarily bumping up unemployment-insurance payments by $600 a week. It is possible, though unlikely, that Congress will pass even more stimulus before the election. Even without another package, however, and even though it is enduring a deep recession, America will probably be the best-performing G7 economy in 2020—perhaps by some margin. Just before the pandemic, the American economy looked slightly stronger than other rich countries. Before long, the gap may be more impressive. ■

Updated at 7:35 p.m. ET

In his Tuesday afternoon briefing with the coronavirus task force, President Trump couched earlier comments about the need to reopen the U.S. economy within weeks, emphasizing that the decision would ultimately be data driven and made in consultation with public health experts.

The president said he still wants Americans working again by Easter Sunday, something he first said during a virtual town hall with Fox News earlier in the day. But he was much more circumspect over whether that would be possible from a medical standpoint.

His previous comments about reopening the economy prompted alarm among public health experts across the country, who said it's far too early. Trump seemed to much more carefully toe the line during his briefing as he talked about ""carefully and responsibly reopening the country.""

""I want to assure Americans that we have a team of public health experts ... also economists and other professionals, working to develop a sophisticated plan to reopen the economy as soon as the time is right, one based on the best science, the best modeling and the best medical research there is anywhere on earth,"" he said.

Trump stressed that this is a ""medical crisis — this isn't a financial crisis.""

In the Fox News TV special earlier Tuesday, Trump said he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""

That's April 12, within the timeline of ""weeks"" that Trump said he hopes is appropriate for curtailing the social distancing, isolation and other measures that officials have outlined to slow the spread of the coronavirus — but that have also paralyzed the economy.

During the briefing, officials also recommended that people who have recently left the New York City metro area should self-quarantine for the next 14 days to ensure the virus doesn't spread.

The rate of infections inside the U.S. has not stopped climbing — by Tuesday afternoon, there were more than 50,000 confirmed cases nationwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University — and Trump's April 12 target date is far sooner than other milestones set by officials across the country.

The District of Columbia has closed its schools through April 24, for example; schools in Virginia won't reconvene at all for the rest of this academic year.

Trump and Vice President Pence have talked up what they call the need for the U.S. to reset in stride, as military commanders might say — to continue some mitigation measures to constrain the pandemic but also permit some businesses to reopen.

""You can destroy a country this way by closing it down,"" Trump said in the Fox special on Tuesday.

The president and vice president framed one focus for the upcoming months on the most vulnerable populations, particularly older people with preexisting medical conditions.

Under this construction, life might shift away from keeping everyone apart to permitting more people to leave their homes and return to work. For the time being, Trump said Americans might still be discouraged from shaking hands and other such activity. ""We can socially distance ourselves and go to work,"" he said.

At the same time, as Pence described it, the national response would shift from one based on dispersing everyone to defending the elderly, although it isn't clear whether public health officials agree or what new steps that might require.

Supply update

During the task force briefing, Pence also spoke about FEMA's effort to identify personal protective equipment and ventilators.

As of Tuesday, FEMA is distributing 7.6 million N95 respirator masks, more than 14 million surgical masks and has already shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York, Pence said.

Pence also reflected on what he called an ""inspiring"" response of businesses around the country who are mobilizing on the production of critical supplies.

""We see industry stepping up,"" Pence said.

""We heard the McDonald's is now offering curbside delivery to truckers who are unable to use the Drive-Thru to pick up a Big Mac.""

Pence also said he's been in talks with Tim Cook of Apple, whose company is donating 9 million N-95 masks to health care facilities across the country and to the national stockpile.

Partway through isolation

The United States is nine days into a 15-day period of White House guidelines to ""slow the spread"" of the virus. When that ends, the administration will begin to assess whether to recommend more isolation and mitigation — or to permit some people to work or travel, as Trump has suggested.

It isn't clear what metrics the White House might use when making that assessment, and the challenge of moving out of this isolation phase is compounded by the unequal affliction of the coronavirus across the country.

Washington state, California and New York state have been hit particularly hard but aren't moving through their rates of infection at the same rate.

Dr. Deborah Birx, leader of the White House's coronavirus response task force, says Washington state is about two weeks ahead of New York, for example.

The White House has acknowledged that many of the important upcoming decisions about the pandemic belong to governors or local officials. Trump and Pence have come under pressure, however, to at least give broad expectations about when life can start to get back to normal.

In recent days, the president has taken on board the idea that too much isolation and too much mitigation could be too ruinous for the economy, saying the ""cure"" can't be worse than the disease.

""We have a pent-up energy that's going to be unbelievable,"" Trump said.

The president said he wants to be mindful about the need to balance public health interests with the desire to reopen America for business, but he also suggested that public health officials might be too conservative.

""I'm sure we have doctors who say, 'Let's keep it closed for two years,' "" Trump said. ""No, we've got to get it open — our people want it open, and that's the way this country was built.""

Trump appeared in a separate interview on Fox on Tuesday and described a scene he had imagined in which millions of worshippers were able to attend Easter services next month.

""Wouldn't it be great to have all of the churches full?"" Trump said, noting that churches have been forced to move online because of social distancing guidelines.

""Online is never going to be like being there,"" he said. ""You're going to have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time.""

Call for consensus on legislation

Trump and Pence called for Congress to complete work on the relief and stimulus legislation that has been under negotiation for the past several days, but they also faulted Democrats for what they called opportunism about the bill.

""All of a sudden they started to throw the Green New Deal stuff in — 'we want green energy,' "" Trump said.

The president dislikes wind turbines after a dispute over the prospect that they might be installed near a golf course he owns in Scotland, and Trump suggested on Tuesday that Democratic support for wind energy might have caused him to reject some of the proposals in the bill.

""They had things in there that were terrible — windmills all over the place ... windmills that kill the birds and ruin the real estate, right?"" Trump said.

Washington must focus on ""the workers,"" the president said. ""Workers first.""

Trump said in his second interview on Fox that he wasn't concerned about the costs associated with what could be a $2 trillion stimulus package, because he considered that to be an investment.

""It's not really spending, because a lot of it is helping companies"" through loans, he said. ""It's loaded to save corporations,"" he said, specifically mentioning Boeing.

""They're going to pay that back,"" he said, noting that some may pay by giving the government some equity and also by repaying with interest.

""We're going to get stock for the taxpayers of our country,"" Trump said."
67,Trump vs. Obama: Who Was Better for Jobs and the Economy? - Money,Trump vs. Obama: Who Was Better for Jobs and the Economy?  Money,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkuY29tL3RydW1wLXZzLW9iYW1hLWVjb25vbXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Money,"When you ask Americans about the most important issues facing our country during an election cycle, you will almost certainly hear about “the economy.”

In fact, a recent report from Pew Research found that about three-quarters of all registered voters said the economy was a “very important” issue for them. A majority of voters on each side of the aisle — 66% of likely Biden voters and 84% of Trump supporters — named the economy as one of their top concerns.

Touting economic achievements is nothing new for politicians, but President Donald Trump makes it no secret he believes his administration's greatest contribution has been bringing in more wealth and prosperity for Americans. Many times, Trump has drawn stark comparisons between the successes of his own policies with those of President Obama: in February 2020, for example, Trump tweeted that the previous administration had ""the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression.""

But how can you really compare the economies under the current and previous presidencies? Some of what is construed as an economic success to certain individuals is viewed as a failure in the eyes of others, which is why measuring the strength of “the economy” under two different presidents requires an unbiased analysis of multiple different factors. In a recent report on the COVID-19 crisis, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, broke down the differences between the economy under the last three years of Obama’s presidency and first three years under Trump. (Take note that economic data for 2020 was not included, in order to leave out the pandemonium caused by the coronavirus — and which would make Trump's numbers look worse.)

In contrast with Trump's numerous claims about building the greatest economy in history, Zandi found that by most measurements, the country's economic health under both administrations is quite similar. ""The reality is that the economy did equally well in the last three years of President Obama’s second term as in Trump’s first three years,"" Zandi wrote.

Here’s a closer look at what the numbers say, based on Zandi's report for Moody's:

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

When Trump took office in 2017, he promised a targeted economic growth rate of 3% each year. While the administration failed to meet that target three years in a row, Trump’s real GDP (adjusting for inflation) was still slightly higher in his first three years than in Obama’s last three. In this case, “slightly” really means just that: Annual economic output under Trump was 2.5%, compared to 2.4% under Obama.

Jobs

The last three years of President Obama’s administration saw an increase of 8.1 million jobs and a 2 percentage-point drop in the overall unemployment rate, decreasing from 6.2% in 2014 to 4.9% by the end of 2016. It's worth noting that when Obama took office in 2009, the country had recently lost around 8.6 million jobs due to the Great Recession.

Under Trump, the number of jobs increased by 6.55 million in his first three years, and unemployment dropped from 4.4% to 3.7%. At the same time, however, the growth rate of disposable income actually dropped, from 2.6% to 2.3%, according to the Moody's report. This decease is likely due in part to the rise of the gig economy; when people are working in positions like independent contractors like Uber drivers or Postmates deliverers, they typically don’t make as much per hour as they would in a position of full-time employment. This in turn lowers levels of disposable income, even as employment in general grows and unemployment rates decline. The rapid expansion of the gig economy did not begin under Trump, but his administration has seen more of its effects than previous administrations.

The Stock Market

During President Trump's first three years in office, the S&P 500 rose by 12.2%, compared to a 7.5% increase in the last three years of the Obama administration. Is this purely because investors love Trump? Maybe, but probably not.

A more likely reason, according to Zandi, is that provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 meant large, publicly-traded corporations saw a sizable cut in the amount of taxes they had to pay in 2018 and 2019. Less taxes on corporations equals higher revenues, which in turn fuels interest in the stock market — and higher stock prices as more people look to get in on the action.

Budget Deficit

The federal budget deficit — accumulated when the government spends more than it receives in revenues — has ballooned from $15 trillion at the end of the Obama administration to over $25 trillion during Trump's first three years in the White House. Soaring deficit levels come as a natural consequence of the 2017 tax cuts: researchers at the Tax Policy Center found that corporate tax revenue declined by 40% between 2017 and 2018, while income taxes paid to the federal government declined by 5.4%. With less tax money coming in but similar levels of spending going out, it’s no wonder the federal deficit has increased.

Trump Facebook ads launched this week but currently set as inactive plug the ""FASTEST GDP GROWTH IN HISTORY,"" with triumphant images of the president. ""Thanks to President Trump's bold action and strong leadership the US economy is only going UP!"" one of the ads says.

Credit: Facebook and Facebook.com/DonaldTrump

Trump has also previewed the message on Twitter in recent days, saying the economy is ""ready to set new records"" and adding: ""Big GDP projected."" It comes as third-quarter gross domestic product figures are expected to be released Thursday, just five days before the final day of voting in the election.

The number is projected to be historic: Economists expect GDP to increase by about 25 percent to 30 percent. And Trump is likely to take full credit for the growth and use it as his final pitch to persuade voters that the country is fully on the mend with a V-shape recovery.

But the reality is more complicated. The economy was recovering from a 31.4 percent drop in the previous quarter, the worst decline ever recorded, amid mass stay-at-home orders. And experts say the path to fully making up the losses is rocky — particularly with coronavirus case numbers rising faster than ever before in the U.S. and a lack of a stimulus package.

""While the third-quarter bounce in GDP will be a record quarterly gain, it isn't all that impressive, as it follows the collapse in economic activity in the second quarter,"" said economist Mark Zandi, who added that ""even with the third-quarter gain, real GDP will have only recovered about two-thirds of what was lost in the second-quarter free fall.""

The economy is poised to grow, as consumer spending was up over the summer, with more people out and about than in the previous months, when the country was largely locked down. Auto and housing markets have also improved as people move out of cities and buy homes and cars to get around instead of take public transportation.

But a lack of new stimulus from Congress means more people will fall into poverty, more businesses will close and more Americans will get evicted in the coming months. The third-quarter growth was fueled by unemployment checks, small-business loans and direct payments, none of which have been replenished for the fourth quarter.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has called it a ""K-shaped"" recovery that's good for upper earners and bad for low-income workers. He has faulted Trump's handling of the pandemic, arguing that the economic fallout would be less severe if he had listened to scientists about public health policy and if he had struck a deal with Congress for additional relief.

“Donald Trump squandered the strong economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration, becoming the worst jobs president since the Great Depression,"" said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. He said Trump's refusal to ""take the pandemic seriously"" means the ""economy is stalling out right now as layoffs rise and infections surge.""

Americans narrowly approve of Trump's handling of the economy and widely disapprove of his response to the coronavirus, according to polling averages tracked by RealClearPolitics. The economy is a rare issue on which battleground state polls show Trump holding an edge over Biden.

Trump's claims that the economy is ready to be the ""best ever"" could have a ring of truth for one group of people: college graduates who are comfortably working from home. Those Americans are saving money on commuting, meals and entertainment expenses. Some who are invested in markets have seen their portfolios appreciate as the Federal Reserve buys large amounts of securities.

But millions of Americans remain unemployed, with dim prospects. Many have been unable to pay rent or mortgages. Large numbers of Americans have been laid off or have had their hours reduced. Millions cannot afford to eat as food insecurity rises.

Big businesses are still announcing large layoffs every week. This week, Disney announced more layoffs, and New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority said that without more help, it would cut up to 8,000 jobs in 2021. At the same time, job growth is slowing, and weekly unemployment numbers are still high.

Rising coronavirus case numbers have caused some states to enact more restrictions. And the coming winter could hit small businesses hard, especially restaurants.

Some Republicans doubt that Trump's message will be a game changer.

""With the virus surging again and much of the country still locked down, no one in America is happy with the economy right now — no matter what the statistics say,"" said Michael Steel, a consultant who worked for Jeb Bush's 2016 presidential campaign and for former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio."

As President Donald Trump leans in to his fervent desire to reopen the nation’s economy by May 1, there is a major obstacle standing in his path: the nation’s governors and mayors who hold the power to enforce closures and who have often taken a far more aggressive posture on protecting public health than the President.

While Trump insisted Friday that he will “certainly listen” to the recommendations of his health experts as he weighs what he has called the most difficult decision he’s ever made, he is assembling an “Opening our Country Council” that will be announced Tuesday. He has repeatedly underscored that America “wasn’t built to be shut down” and has mused aloud about lifting stay-at-home orders in different parts of the country while keeping hotspots locked down.

In that sense, there is a widening chasm between the commander-in-chief’s desires and the current frame of mind of many governors and mayors who will dictate when Americans can begin going back to work. Many of them are increasingly asserting that authority as they brush away questions about reopening with warnings to stay the course.

The University of Washington’s IHME modeling suggests that states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota and Texas will not hit their worst points until late this month. The President has offered no clarity about how American parents can return to work as an increasing number of school districts announce closures through the end of the year. And this week as Trump focused on steps toward reopening, Democratic governors like Connecticut’s Ned Lamont and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer were moving in the opposite direction, extending their stay-at-home guidance to later dates.

“We must work to keep the curve flat – together as a community. Keep staying home. Keep social distancing,” Lamont tweeted after extending stay-at-home restrictions to at least May 20. “Now is not the time to take our foot off of the accelerator.”

Whitmer, who oversees a state that has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country as of Saturday night, said the state is faced with “dangerously low levels of the medications required to safely place patients on ventilators” – one of the many reasons she extended the stay-at-home order through April 30. Far from relaxing guidelines, she announced new restrictions prohibiting most Michiganders from even going to another residence unless they were caring for a relative or dropping off a child.

“Now is not the time to pull back at all,” Whitmer said as she announced her orders this week. “We are in control of our fate here and it depends on every one of us doing our part … When we all take this seriously we will save lives here in Michigan.”

Democratic New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been sparring with fellow Democrat and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo over who has the authority to close schools, announced Saturday that he would shutter schools for the rest of the year, asking New Yorkers to think about September as “a new era.”

Cuomo said it would be within his legal authority to decide whether to close schools and that the decision would be made by the entire metropolitan region: “There’s been no decision on schools.”

“I don’t understand how you’d start businesses in May, but not open schools until June,” Cuomo said, noting there had been no decision on either. “You have to coordinate the businesses with the schools, because schools do education; schools also do daycare effectively for a large percentage of the New York population.”

Asked about Trump’s hopes for reopening the economy, Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam– who has closed schools until the end of the year and extended his state’s stay-at-home order until June 10 – noted this week that there is a tension between aspirations and backing them up with science.

“There is nobody out there that wants us to get back to our life as normal more than me, but we also have to deal with reality,” Northam said, describing the coronavirus pandemic as “a biological war.” “I’m a doctor, as you know. I understand the importance of keeping people healthy. So I’m looking at the data …. My job as your governor is to keep Virginians safe.”

Following up, Daniel Carey, Virginia’s secretary of health and human resources, was blunt as he outlined the state’s hurdles for getting back to normal: from the long delays in test results, to the “national shortage” in testing, to the shortage in supplies to conduct the tests, to the fact that the state has primarily been testing in nursing homes and hospitals, rather than the community at large.

Republican governors have sounded similar warnings.

Asked about the social distancing guidelines, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who has been among the most proactive governors in the country, said, “We’ve got to keep doing it.”

Unlike Trump, who has said mass testing may not be necessary, DeWine said “robust testing” would be “absolutely necessary to get people back to work.”

“We’re doing well, but we can’t let this monster up,” DeWine said on CNN’s Newsroom on Friday. His stay-at-home order extends to May 1, and when asked who would make the call on reopening the economy, DeWine said, “Historically, health issues like this are handled by governors, they are handled by mayors, and I think that’s generally what people expect.”

On Friday after Massachusetts had its single biggest day for new cases, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker cautioned that the state was “still on the upward slope” and was about to enter “the most difficult period we are going to face.” Models indicate that the peak could hit around April 20, he said, depending on the extent to which everyone stays home, practices good personal hygiene and keeps their distance from one another.

“If we do not see a flattening in the daily cases and new hospitalizations, we may need to make some adjustments in our planning and we will,” said Baker, who has extended his stay-at-home guidance through May 4.

And while the President contended during his Friday briefing that he controls the process for reopening the economy, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, sharply contradicted that assertion during his Friday night briefing, hours after Los Angeles County – with a population of 10 million people – extended stay-at-home orders until at least May 15.

“We will be in charge of those decisions,” said Garcetti, stating that the call would be made as a region in consultation with other cities, counties and the governor. He added that the decision would hinge on figuring out the percentage of people who have been sickened or been carriers of Covid-19 based on antibody and other tests. The LA mayor, who has been talking daily with other mayors across America, added that before cities can resume business-as-usual, they “need the Feds to act faster and give deeper aid,” arguing it “has not been enough” and “it has not come quickly enough.”

The pain is particularly acute in Los Angeles, where nearly half of Angelenos said they have either been laid off or had their hours reduced, according to a survey released Saturday by Loyola Marymount University’s Center for the Study of Los Angeles.

“If you want to get the economy open, Mr. President, Congress, any mayor – do the work of getting the public health professionals who can track and trace, get us the tests so we can have the blood tests to know who’s immune and who’s not. And so the people who are not can properly distance and potentially work in environments with new rules.”

Garcetti also dismissed the idea of opening up the country in a piecemeal fashion with different sets of rules for different areas, stating that it would be “dangerous” to have different standards in different parts of the country.

“This is something that will require national leadership, it is not something we can wall off, keep away, enforce at gunpoint. Those things would be ridiculous,” Garcetti said, noting there was no way to put enough professionals on the border to keep non-essential people from driving across state lines. “We are not going to be able to build a wall around Los Angeles or California.”

A perception gap

For many weeks now, the President has appeared to live in a different reality about the nation’s coronavirus prognosis than what the governors and mayors on the front lines are experiencing, a perception gap that suggests looming confrontations with local officials who do not share the President’s eagerness to reopen the country for business by May.

That perception gap has persisted since the height of delusion when Trump made his now abandoned pronouncement that he hoped to see the pews full on Easter Sunday – which was later described as aspirational – to his continued insistence the nation’s patchwork coronavirus testing system, with its substantial rate of false negatives, “is the best in the world.”

Trump’s alternate reality was evident in a confrontation with CNN’s Jim Acosta during a briefing Friday when the President seemed incensed at the notion that nurses, doctors and hospitals are still saying they need ventilators and protective equipment.

He demanded to know who was saying such things, despite impassioned pleas daily on television and social media from medical professionals, nurses and nursing homes in different hot spots for more personal protective equipment (not to mention all the resource, equipment and ventilator sharing that is going on collaboratively among states).

Trump dismissed those reports of PPE shortages Friday as “fake news.” During the same briefing, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn was up at the podium in the White House briefing room offering guidance to medical practitioners that they could begin reusing cloth gowns that could be laundered, conjuring up images of operating rooms in previous centuries. Hahn also said the FDA had authorized two companies who will supply machines to sterilize N95 masks so they could be reused.

During his news conference Friday, Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said the most pressing question of the pandemic at this stage is when worldwide companies and companies across America “will be able to ramp up production fast enough to get enough PPE.”

“It’s something we’re handling at a state level but that other states are trying to deal with — that every one of my fellow governors is talking about on every one of our, so far twelve, conference calls with all the governors,” said Hogan, who chairs the National Governors Association. “It’s what you hear about every single day in every press conference with the President and vice president. It’s the number one problem that we have today is the lack of PPE.”

In that regard, the state’s governors have served as real time fact-checkers of the President’s optimistic announcements. On Saturday, New Jersey officials reiterated the state’s desperate need for ventilators and personal protective equipment, as the commissioner of the state’s department reported that there are 61 ventilators available in state warehouses at a time when their models predict state hospitalizations will peak at 15,922.

“We have very few ventilators left right now. … We’re literally at the edge” in terms of ventilator supply, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said Saturday in Trenton.

At the time of his midday announcement, Murphy said there were 3,599 new cases of coronavirus in the state, bringing the statewide total to 58,151 – the second highest number in the nation behind New York state.

“We’re not in the end zone folks, we cannot spike any footballs,” he said, as he described progress in flattening the curve.

Cuomo, whose state has been hit harder than any state in the nation, said the number of deaths in his state were “stabilizing at a horrific rate,” hovering between 777 and 799 over the past few days.

“People ask when is it over?” Cuomo said, adding that many Americans are living with that same question. “Every time you wake up, you say when does this nightmare end?”

People are asking him for “some certainty, some closure, some control of my life back,” he said. Confronting the question about the President’s desire to reopen the economy, Cuomo took pains to note they have been working “hand in glove,” complimenting Trump for being responsive to New York’s needs: “He’s done it quickly and he’s done it efficiently.”

When outlining what the federal government could do to help New York, he noted that a true reopening of the economy doesn’t happen without his state.

“You think you’re going to reopen the economy without the engine of the New York Metropolitan area? You’re kidding yourself,” Cuomo said.

But at a time of great uncertainty, New York’s governor said the best course for moving forward will be to keep politics out of the discussion, especially in a presidential year. The dialogue over reopening sooner or faster, he said, is “corrosive and destructive.”

“If we don’t stop it, it will feed on itself,” he said.

“Winston Churchill said, ‘Now, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning,’” Cuomo said Saturday in his briefing. “I think that’s a fair statement of where we are now.”"

President Donald Trump’s gamble on reopening the United States economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the nation has backfired, leaving the president in a losing political position just four months before the US election.

Trump cast himself as the cheerleader-in-chief and has pushed US governors and business leaders to reopen the economy with the hope that the virus would wane. That has not happened.

Now, infection rates are exploding throughout the South and West of the US, and the virus is returning to states that had previously peaked. Trump has refused to acknowledge the rising risks, claiming case numbers are a function of more widely available testing and instead pushed to reopen schools beginning as soon as next month.

The talk of reopening schools, as the virus resurges, has unsettled parents and families nationwide and left governors and local officials in the difficult position of having to make plans without adequate resources or guidance.

“Trump has clearly lost his footing,” said Shibley Telhami, a pollster and professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland.

“He is losing the narrative. If you can’t get the pandemic under control, you can’t reopen the economy,” Telhami told Al Jazeera.

Trump’s handling of the pandemic is not winning over the American public. Opinion polls suggest Trump is trailing his Democratic opponent Joe Biden by an average of more than eight percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics.com. Biden leads in the key states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Florida that are likely to turn the election.

“The president has a governing problem that has become a political problem,” said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

“He has failed to stop the spread of this disease. The United States is the worst in the world among developed nations,” Kondik told Al Jazeera.

Biden leads Trump in support among Americans by 49 percent to 40 percent, according to a survey of 1,500 adults by The Economist/YouGov taken July 12-14.

“If his poll numbers look this way on election day, he is almost certainly going to lose,” Kondik said.

Indeed, for weeks Republicans who could lose control of both the White House and the US Congress to Democrats have been expressing alarm at the president’s weakened political position.

After low turnout at a much-hyped Trump rally in Oklahoma, Karl Rove, the Republican mastermind behind former President George W Bush’s winning campaigns, told the television outlet Fox News that the president needed to hit the “reset” button on his campaign.

In late June, after Black Lives Matter protests had rocked the US, the number 2 Republican in the Senate, John Thune, called for a “change in tone” from the president.

Trump is losing independent voters and needs to deliver a new “message that deals with substance and policy”, Thune told reporters at the US Capitol.

But the president has stayed his course, appealing to his base of partisan Republican voters, advancing a tough “law and order” posture towards the protests, and escalating tensions with China, which he blames for the virus’s spread.

The president has abandoned his once-daily briefings on the coronavirus, sidelined government scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and waged a whisper campaign of criticism of Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health.

Fauci has been a leading voice for social distancing and shutdown measures to control the spread of the virus. He called the White House’s attempts to discredit him “bizarre” and in a series of interviews this week, called for stepping back from reopening the economy.

“Trump continues to be, frankly, irrationally indifferent to the magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic,” said James Henson, a politics professor at the University of Texas.

“The Trump administration and the Trump campaign are gambling that in states like Texas – where the pandemic is just burning out of control – he’ll survive it,” Henson told Al Jazeera.

In a speech at the White House on July 14, Trump gave a preview of the campaign ahead by claiming the number of deaths from the virus are going down. The president drew distinctions between himself and Biden on rebuilding the economy, stopping immigration and getting tough on China.

But his performance was rambling, many of his claims were not backed up by facts and his use of a ceremonial space at the White House to deliver a partisan speech drew criticism.

The next day, Trump replaced his campaign manager Brad Parscale, who had delivered his unlikely 2016 win, with Bill Stepien, a political consultant and former operative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Whether Stepien can reinvent Trump’s campaign is an open question. Trump has been forced to cancel planned events in New Hampshire and Alabama because of the virus.

“Trump’s political position is precarious at this point,” said James Lance Taylor, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco.

“He has to run on the pandemic response and the economy, but he can’t. His response to the crisis has been inept,” Taylor told Al Jazeera.

“He’s going to have to pull a rabbit out of the hat,” he said.

Attendance at the Republican National Convention, scheduled for August 24-27 in Jacksonville, Florida – where Republicans will formally nominate Trump for a second four-year term – will be curtailed as the state suffers the US’s worst outbreak.

And without firm national leadership coming from the president on the pandemic, state and local leaders have been left to devise their own strategies leading to a patchwork of policies and uncertainty about what the future holds.

“The president has made so many bad executive decisions,” said House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the number 1 Democrat in Congress.

“He is like the man who refuses to ask for directions,” Pelosi said.

“The answers are there. The scientists have the answers. The answers are testing, tracing and treating,” Pelosi told reporters at a news conference on Thursday."

During the first presidential debate in Cleveland, President Donald Trump repeated an assertion he’s made literally dozens of times.

When the novel coronavirus appeared, Trump said, ""I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country.""

The U.S. economy prior to the coronavirus was strong. But it was not the best in the nation’s history, economists say.

The strongest evidence for Trump is the unemployment rate. On Trump’s watch, the unemployment rate plunged to levels that it hasn’t touched since the early 1950s. It appears to be the lowest peacetime unemployment rate over a three-year period, going back to the Great Depression, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.

Trump benefited from the continuation of trends that had been in place under the Obama recovery.

""While Trump can take some credit, I see it like the relief pitcher who comes in during the 9th inning with a seven-run lead, then boasts about winning the game,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""It’s fine to get some credit for holding the lead, but this is much more an Obama story than a Trump story.""

Growth in the nation’s gross domestic product — probably the single most important statistic used to gauge the overall strength of the economy — has been so-so on Trump’s watch. It didn’t reach his pledge of 4% growth a year, earning it a Promise Broken.

The annual increases in GDP under Trump were broadly similar to what they were during the final six years under his predecessor, Barack Obama. And GDP growth under Trump was well below that of prior presidents.

If you adjust GDP to take account of population, the picture remains weak for Trump. Calculations by Burtless found that inflation-adjusted GDP per capita increased 1.9% annually under Trump, which makes this three-year period the 16th highest among the past 30 non-overlapping three-year periods — right about average compared with his predecessors.

Economists added a couple other factors that cast doubt on the supremacy of the economy under Trump.

One is wages. Adjusted for inflation, wages that began rising during the Obama years continued to increase under Trump. But these inflation-adjusted wage increases were modest compared with the 2% a year seen in the 1960s. ""This is not what you would expect with a 3.5% unemployment rate,"" Baker said, alluding to the pre-pandemic rate of February 2020.

In addition, federal deficits relative to GDP have historically fallen during ""great"" economic periods, such as the 1960s and the late 1990s, when unemployment rates weren’t much higher than what the U.S. experienced before the pandemic, said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis.

By contrast, under Trump, the federal budget deficit widened even before the pandemic hit and has grown further during the crisis.

Another factor undermining Trump’s claim is that the Federal Reserve was feeding the economy with historically low interest rates — rates on par with what the Fed usually enacts during poor economic times to revive the economy. In fact, the Fed went so far as to interrupt its plan to ""normalize"" interest rates by stopping interest-rate increases in early 2019, and it began cutting rates in August 2019, well before the pandemic. (The Trump administration made it clear that it wanted to keep rates low.)

This ""certainly contradicts the assessment of the economy as being ‘great,’"" Fazzari said.

Burtless also looked at the growth rate in personal consumption per person, adjusted for inflation — a metric that for many families is the bottom line of economic activity, determining how much they can spend on food, clothing, housing, health care, and travel.

In Trump’s three years in office through January 2020, real consumption per person grew by 2% a year. Of the 30 non-overlapping three-year periods since 1929, this ranks Trump 12th from the bottom.

Presidents can have an impact on economic conditions, but they are not the only factor. Oil price fluctuations, changes in technology and the state of the global economy are among the things outside of their control.

In Trump’s case, even the things he did, such as the 2017 tax cut, had ""disappointing"" results for economic growth, Fazzari said.

""According to its supporters, the tax cut was supposed to rocket GDP growth upward and, in particular, stimulate business capital investment,"" Fazzari said. ""Neither has happened.""

Specifically, he pointed to the inflation-adjusted rate of nonresidential private fixed investment, which measures purchases of such items as nonresidential structures, equipment and software. This metric rose for a while after the tax cut passed, but since then has been on a downward trend and actually went negative in late 2019 before collapsing during the pandemic.

Our ruling

Trump said that before the coronavirus pandemic, the United States had ""the greatest economy in the history of our country.""

Economists pointed to multiple data points that undermine this assertion. While unemployment was near historical lows under Trump, growth in gross domestic product was well below what previous presidents achieved, and other metrics such as wages and business investment ranged from decent to mediocre.

We rate the statement False."

“The job market is still a shadow of what it was prior to the pandemic,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said.

The White House bragged about the jobless rate falling from a peak of 14.7 percent in April to 8.4 percent in August, but that decrease obscures the sobering deficit that still remains of more than 11 million jobs, compared to the pre-pandemic labor market.

The picture is even grimmer for some worker subgroups: By February, Black unemployment had already begun to creep up from the 5.5 percent low it hit in the fall of 2019, skyrocketing to 16.7 percent in April and then rising again in May, a month in which the overall unemployment dropped. Black unemployment was 13 percent in August and Hispanic unemployment was 10.5 percent.

The reality when it comes to the recovery in economic activity also falls short of White House claims. Third quarter gross domestic product is scheduled to be released Wednesday, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking tool indicates an unprecedented jump of 32 percent.

Bragging about the pre-coronavirus economy does little to reassure a worried electorate, Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com, said. “The administration will tout the strength of the recovery in recent months, but that’s also within the context of steep declines in March and April, and the same is true of the annualized contraction in GDP. When people talk about the fact that there's likely a record rebound, the two cannot be viewed in the absence of the other,” he said.

“What’s most important is where the economy stands and where it’s headed … GDP will likely be contracting for the full year,” he said.

“The real risk, and the real issue, is Q4,” Zandi said. “Given the lack of momentum … you can cherry-pick numbers, but the reality is even after that strong Q3 number, we’re only going to get about half the GDP back.""

Biden has said the middle class got a raw deal even before the pandemic, noting Trump’s policies exacerbated economic inequality. The Federal Reserve found that, in 2018, nearly 4 in 10 Americans would be unable to shoulder a $400 emergency expense without having to borrow money, an increase of a mere two percentage points from 2017, the first year of Trump’s presidency and the year the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was implemented.

Likewise, the stock market increases the president touts have not been shared equally: According to the Pew Research Center, nearly half of Americans have no exposure to the stock market at all, and a mere 14 percent of households have any direct investments in individual stocks.

“We know there were disproportionate gains in income among the wealthiest Americans. That was because of the strength of the stock market and the way the tax cut was designed,” Hamrick said. “Those are inconvenient facts for the president.”

For a president elected on a platform of economic populism, the vast majority of Americans have gained remarkably little. In the first quarter of 2020, just before Covid-19 struck, the richest 10 percent of households held roughly 69 percent of the nation’s collective wealth, with just over 31 percent held by the richest 1 percent, while the poorest half held a mere 1.4 percent — figures nearly unchanged from the first quarter of Trump’s presidency.

Zandi said the tax cuts introduced in 2017 were a boon to rich Americans and corporations, and pointed out that financing those tax cuts also left the nation on shakier economic footing for the long term. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said the tax cuts could add from $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the federal debt — and most American households will have little to show for it, Zandi said.

“The prime beneficiaries were high-income, high-net worth households. They were the winners,” he said."

There have been times when unemployment was lower, wage growth faster, productivity stronger. Then there’s the rising national debt, currently at a post-war record 80 percent of GDP and set to rise above 98 percent by 2030.

That said, people seem pretty happy overall as the US economy rolls though its 11th consecutive year of expansion. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Monday found 56 percent of respondents approving of the way Trump is handling the economy. And a late December CNN poll found 76 percent rated economic conditions as very or somewhat good, the highest share to say the economy is good since 80 percent in February 2001.

It is really possible, then, that the late 1970s economy under President Carter — who lost the 1980s election in a landslide to Ronald Reagan — is better than the current one? Take a look at this graphic, which attempts to make that very point by showing real GDP in the third year of the first terms of Carter, Bill Clinton, and Trump.

Look, economic growth will be slower under Trump than Carter. But that’s not a particularly impressive showing for the 39th president. The economy was enjoying a massive demographic tailwind back then. As the San Francisco Fed noted in a 2018 report, labor force growth alone contributed 2.7 percentage points to GDP growth in the 1970s, “meaning that even if productivity growth had been zero, the economy would have expanded at 2.7%, slightly faster than the pace of our current expansion.”

Today’s potential labor force growth is more like a half percent. If the Carter years had today’s demographics — all else equal — it might have hardly grown at all. Moreover, that zippy 1970s growth came amid high inflation — eventually squeezed out by a nasty early 1980s recession — and high unemployment. The Misery Index averaged 16 under Carter, 6 under Trump. Consumer confidence was collapsing during the Carter years. That’s a big reason why he got walloped by The Gipper. The 1970s was a period when inflation got out of hand and productivity growth downshifted. While we can debate the historical strength of today’s economy, no one should seriously suggest the late-1970s merit consideration as the best ever."

President Donald Trump says he is particularly pleased with the jobs created during his three years in office.

“We’re producing jobs like you have never seen before in this country,” he said during a recent speech in Michigan.

But you don’t have to go back far to find three years of better job growth. Just to back to the previous three years under Barack Obama.

During Trump’s first 36 months in office, the US economy has gained 6.6 million jobs. But during a comparable 36-month period at the end of Obama’s tenure, employers added 8.1 million jobs, or 23% more than what has been added since Trump took office.

The average monthly gain so far under Trump is 182,000 jobs. During the last 36 months under Obama, employers were adding an average of 224,000 jobs a month.

On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers added a fairly robust 225,000 jobs in January. But it also made some revisions to past data, which lowered many previous job growth estimates. While some of the revisions go all the way back to the last century, most of the changes to data took place during 2018 and 2019. So the revisions reduced the gains during Obama’s final three years by 47,000 jobs, but it reduced the gains during Trump’s tenure by a total of 354,000 jobs.

The job record under Trump is far better than the job record during Obama’s first 35 months in office, when the economy lost 805,000 jobs. But Obama took office in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. In the final job reading before Obama took office, the economy lost 784,000 jobs in that month alone. And it continued to lose jobs throughout the rest of 2009 as Obama’s economic policies went into effect.

By comparison, Trump took office with the labor market in relatively good shape, with unemployment at 4.7%, and a string of 76 straight months of job gains. The labor market has clearly continued to improve. Unemployment of 3.6% in January is nearly at a 50-year low now. But it is a continuation of an improving job market, not the turnaround that occurred in the early years of the Obama administration.

And Trump’s job record is not unique. A gain of more than 6.6 million jobs during a 35-month period has been common during the 80 years that the Labor Department has counted jobs. There are hundreds of overlapping 36-month periods of better growth on record.

At this point in his first and only term, Jimmy Carter had enjoyed a gain of about 10.1 million jobs.

There are many economists who might agree with Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, that the tax cuts have not generated much, if any, economic growth, but most conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, are not among them.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by Congress and signed by Trump in December 2017, was billed by Republicans as a catalyst to accelerate economic growth and in turn, to create more jobs and higher wages. The law lowered many individual tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, eliminated personal exemptions and increased child tax credits, among other changes. It also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It is expected to add $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.

In an open letter to Congress in November 2017, more than 100 economists in support of the tax cuts predicted the tax cuts would “ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations.”

A Congressional Research Service review of the first-year impact of the law, however, did not find evidence of “large effects particularly in the short run.”

CRS, May 22, 2019: In 2018, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 2.9%, about the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO’s) projected rate published in 2017 before the tax cut. On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy. Although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut’s effects on GDP, they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run. Although investment grew significantly, the growth patterns for different types of assets do not appear to be consistent with the direction and size of the supply-side incentive effects one would expect from the tax changes. This potential outcome may raise questions about how much longer-run growth will result from the tax revision.

Last week, Biden seized on the GDP growth figures highlighted in the CRS report to argue that the TCJA has “generated virtually no growth at all.” And, Biden added, that is according to conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation.

“Imagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut and we hadn’t wasted it on the wealthy, that generated virtually no growth at all,” Biden said on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” on June 10. “No growth at all, according to most of the conservative think tanks.”

“And imagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut that he promoted and got passed for the wealthy, even places like the Heritage Foundation said that didn’t grow the economy. $2 trillion,” Biden said on June 11 during a roundtable meeting in Philadelphia on opening the economy. “Imagine if we had it right now, to focus on the things that can build a new economy, invest in everything from teleconference, into providing for the kind of health.”

What Economists Say

We reached out to the Biden campaign for backup, and it passed along the nonpartisan CRS report, which as we said, concluded that “the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy.”

Biden’s campaign also pointed to a May 29, 2019, article from Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, who wrote that the CRS report findings were consistent with the Tax Policy Center prediction in December 2017 that the “short-term macroeconomic effects” would be “extremely modest.”

“In fairness, the tax cuts didn’t occur in a vacuum,” Gleckman wrote in that same article. “Some of their benefits may have been offset by President Trump’s own highly restrictive trade policy, or magnified by new deficit spending approved by Congress in 2018.”

In his latest update about the economic impact of the TCJA, published on Feb. 5, Gleckman concluded after looking at two years of data: “Despite the Trump Administration’s rosy promises that the post-TCJA economy would boom, it has instead grown on many dimensions at roughly the same steady, unspectacular pace as it did prior to passage of the tax law.”

“Our forecast at the time the TCJA became law was for a modest short-term bump in economic output (mostly from people spending their tax cuts) followed by a gradual return to pre-TCJA trend,” Gleckman told us via email. “That is pretty much what happened. … Business investment fell after passage. Employment pretty much tracked pre-TCJA trends. GDP growth had its bump, then returned to trend.”

“Remember too that the growth story the White House told was this: The TCJA would encourage more capital investment that would lead to more productivity and, eventually, to higher wages,” Gleckman said. “The reality was: We never even got the first step, except for a brief period just before and after passage of the law.”

Gleckman acknowledged, however, that it is “impossible to pull apart tax policy from other issues, including Trump’s trade policy in 2018 and 2019.” It is possible, he said, that the “TCJA contributed to more growth but that benefit was offset by the tariffs (which are a tax increase on US consumers and businesses). Or not.”

“The disruptions of 2020 mean we never will know the long-term effects of the TCJA,” Gleckman said. “But based on what we saw in 2018 and 2019, there is no evidence that the TCJA contributed very much to economic growth.”

Those analyses — from CRS and the Tax Policy Center, which is not a conservative group — provide some ammunition for Biden’s claim that the TCJA “generated virtually no growth at all.” That’s his assessment, and some economists agree.

But Biden is wrong to claim that “most of the conservative think tanks” agree.

Biden’s campaign cited three articles that it says came from conservative institutions: two from the American Enterprise Institute and one from the Tax Foundation. None of them support Biden’s claim, though.

The article from Nicole Kaeding, then at the Tax Foundation, was titled “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act After A Year” and was published on Dec. 17, 2018.

Kaeding wrote that one year after the law’s passage there was “very little” evidence “we point to on how the Act has impacted the U.S economy.” But Kaeding also wrote that “the law’s design is such that the economic impacts are long-run. It takes several years for the lower cost of capital to impact investment. Firms need time to plan, purchase, and permit new investments before they put the items into service. As we noted in our original score, much of the acceleration of growth happens several years after the law’s original passage, before fading as provisions in the law expire.”

Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said Biden is distorting the Tax Foundation’s position.

“Our position is not that the TCJA ‘has generated no growth at all,’ but rather that identifying the specific impact the TCJA had on growth is challenging given the many other factors at play that drive business investment and economic growth,” Watson told us via email. “This includes the economic headwinds produced by the escalating trade war in 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic today. This is in addition to the fact that it may take several years to isolate the impact of a tax change, as Nicole pointed out in her piece. We provided feedback on a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on TCJA last year, for example, arguing that ‘its conclusion that the TCJA has produced little to no increase in output (GDP) and its argument that investment has not increased as was expected…are too strong given the evidence.’”

The first article from the American Enterprise Institute cited by the Biden campaign was one written by Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. Although Viard wrote that “a sharp uptick in investment has not occurred,” he did not conclude that the TCJA has generated no growth.

Rather, Viard posed three possibilities, only one of which considers the possibility that “the corporate tax cut is not boosting investment.” It is also possible, he wrote, that “the boost is taking longer than expected” or that “the tax cut boosted investment relative to what it would otherwise have been, even as other factors (perhaps other TCJA provisions or the trade war) have offset the boost.”

“It would be very surprising it if didn’t generate any growth at all,” Viard told us in a phone interview, adding that as a general economic principle, the corporate tax cuts should increase investment in the U.S.

Viard said that while “the growth impact may be smaller than many of us [conservative economists] thought,” it is “impossible to know” whether the law’s effects are simply taking longer than expected, or if the growth it generated has been offset by other factors, such as the trade war.

The third article cited by the Biden campaign is a blog post written for AEI by Jason Furman. But Furman is not affiliated with AEI. Furman, an economics professor at Harvard and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, served eight years as a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. According to Viard, Furman was simply invited to participate in a blog symposium about the effects of the TCJA. The symposium sought to include input from economists across the ideological spectrum.

Wrong on Heritage Foundation

As for Biden’s specific claim that “even places like the Heritage Foundation said that [TCJA] didn’t grow the economy,” the Biden campaign did not get back to us with backup for that.

But the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that’s false.

On Twitter, Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst who focuses on tax policy for the Heritage Foundation, pointed to his Dec. 12 commentary “How 2 Years of Tax Cuts Have Supported Our Strong Economy.”

When Biden said something similar last August, Michel tweeted, “I think I’ve written something basically every week for the last year+ that says the tax cuts are working.”

In a series of tweets, Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of Heritage, also took issue with Biden’s comments, saying, “The country saw increased wage growth, business investment, and employment thanks to the law.”

In a Nov. 4 post, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation looked at what economists from various viewpoints were saying about the TCJA nearly two years after its implementation. One of its conclusions: “Economists do not agree on the economic effects of the TCJA.” Additionally, it concludes, “economists generally agree that while certain definitive trends are emerging, it is impossible to undertake a full accounting of the TCJA’s effects until more time has passed.”

“A full analysis of the effects of the TCJA will not be possible to complete for years to come, if ever,” the Peterson report states.

Biden is, of course, entitled to his opinion about the effect of the TCJA. And he has numerous economists he could cite who agree the tax cuts have, to date, resulted in very little economic growth. But he is wrong when he says that “most of the conservative think tanks” in general, and the Heritage Foundation in particular, agree that the tax cuts resulted in “virtually no growth.” In fact, they do not agree.

The American economy is in shambles, the result of a pandemic which ended a decade-long stretch of growth and caused a historic wave of job losses earlier this year.

With less than two weeks to go until Election Day, voters are deciding which candidate they want to put it back together.

So far, the economy has regained just over half of the 22 million jobs lost from February to April. Both the Democratic nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump have made opposing cases to rebuild from the wreckage.

Biden argues the catastrophic public health response from the Trump administration deepened the economic downturn, setting the stage for a highly uneven recovery between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else. He's unveiled plans to smother the virus and get people safely back to work.

Meanwhile, Trump boasts the economy had reached historic heights before the pandemic, even though it was growing just slightly above the same rate as his immediate predecessors. The president contends he can restore that progress, promising lower taxes and deregulation without specifying further.

Still, experts say presidents wield only limited power on the economy's trajectory.

""It's true the president is probably the single most powerful person with the most influence over it,"" Aaron Sojourner, a former White House economist who served both the Obama and Trump administrations, told Business Insider. ""But nobody has very much control over it.""

Here are nine charts that illustrate the state of the economy going back two decades and how Trump stacks up compared to his two predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush."

Last year’s growth was the weakest since Trump took office, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday, as Trump’s escalating trade war with China triggered a major pullback in business spending and investment. From April through December, business investment contracted as corporate leaders preferred to sit on cash or return it to investors instead of using it to build factories or buy equipment.

The falloff in growth — from 2.9 percent in 2018 to a more typical pace in 2019 — suggests the stimulus from the tax cuts is wearing off and the trade war is canceling out many of its benefits. The tax cuts came with a hefty price tag that many Republicans hoped would be offset by stronger growth for years.

But last year’s growth also shows the economy’s resilience, as it rebounded from recession fears in August to close out the year on solid footing thanks largely to American consumers.

Economists predict the U.S. economy will cool further in 2020, with growth coming in around 2 percent, but few anticipate a recession. The big question mark is whether businesses will start spending again now that Trump has paused his trade battle with China.

If companies begin deploying more cash and investing, growth could pick up and return closer to 2018′s levels. But an increasing number of forecasters say growth could slide further thanks to headline-making head winds, such as the production stoppage at Boeing and the fast-spreading coronavirus in China.

“You can see the sugar high in 2018 in consumption and business investment that has gone away in 2019,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. “We don’t see a corporate investment rebound in 2020. It’s going to be a very sluggish year.”

Trump and his fellow Republicans have portrayed the U.S. economy’s performance as “unprecedented,” “historic” and in the “fast lane” after the GOP tax cuts. Many economists paint a different picture, though, describing the economy as slightly above potential.

The president’s top economic adviser predicted growth would top 3 percent for at least two quarters this year.

""I think we will see a big pickup in growth. We may not see it in the winter quarter...but I’m hopeful that we’ll see it in the spring,” Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, said on Fox Business. “It’s a fundamentally healthy economy,” he said, touting the 3.5 percent unemployment rate and “tremendous wage gains.”

Last year, Kudlow offered a similar prediction that did not come to fruition. Growth was 2.1 percent in the final three months of the year, slightly better than many economists expected but below this expansion’s 2.3 percent average.

American consumers continue to drive the U.S. economy. Numerous polls and surveys show consumer confidence remains high. Americans believe it is easy to get a job and their incomes are likely to stay the same or improve in coming months.

Government spending increased markedly during the Trump presidency, boosting economic growth. The deficit — or gap between spending and tax revenue — neared $1 trillion in 2019, an unprecedented level during good economic times when there is not an all-consuming war effort underway. Trump’s tax cuts and additional funding for the military and domestic programs have pushed the gap wider.

Despite the additional government stimulus, Trump has yet to achieve a year of the 3 percent growth he promised before taking office.

Trump has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve for the shortfall, but most economists say Trump’s escalating trade war and economic weakness abroad dragged down growth last year. The ongoing fallout at Boeing after the two 737 Max plane crashes and the General Motors strike that idled production at GM factories for much of October also damped growth. Boeing is usually the largest U.S. exporter, but orders dried up after the tragedies.

“The United States is by far the strongest economic power in the world,” Trump said in a speech last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “It’s despite the fact that the Fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly.”

Trump frequently boasts about his stewardship over the economy. The growth during his tenure has exceeded the average in the first and second terms of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, but it is not unprecedented. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton oversaw faster expansions.

Economists caution against giving presidents too much credit for the economy, but surveys show voters often feel otherwise. Late last year, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found 44 percent of Americans said the economy had improved under Trump, and among that group, nearly 4 in 5 said he deserves at least a good amount of the credit.

When the president cites the economy’s strength, he often references stock market gains. Last year, the widely watched Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index soared nearly 29 percent, helping boost the fortunes of the roughly half of Americans who have some money in equities. But many economists note a disconnect between a surging stock market and a slowing, unspectacular economy.

Business confidence plummeted over the summer as Trump escalated his trade war with China and threatened to hit Mexico with extensive tariffs. Business investment shrank for three consecutive quarters last year to end 2019.

“I don’t think it’s within the ability of this president to really relieve uncertainty all that much,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at investment firm Mellon. “Immediately after completing the ‘Phase One’ trade deal with China, the president rattled the cage by threatening Europe with auto tariffs.”

The Trump tax cuts that took effect in 2018 gave businesses the biggest reduction in their tax bills in U.S. history. The vast majority of Americans also paid less in taxes. But most economists say the cuts’ benefits were heavily curtailed by Trump’s trade war.

“The tax cuts likely did provide some boost to consumer spending, but that boost was temporary,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. “Any benefits have been overshadowed by the head winds come from trade-policy uncertainty.”

Trump had said the tax cuts would lure factories back to the United States, but business investment in structures such as warehouses and buildings fell more than 10 percent last year.

Only investment in intellectual property and residential housing rose. For all the insults Trump lobs at the Fed, Reinhart points out spending on housing and home construction went up in the second half of the year after the central bank cut interest rates. If the Fed had not acted, growth would probably have been even slower.

Job growth is expected to cool further this year as businesses struggle to find workers with the skills they need. Typically wages would surge in such a tight labor market, but earnings growth slowed slightly last year. For now, many Americans say it is still easy to find a job, but there are early signs companies are taking down job postings and demand has started to decline.

Labor Department data shows no increase in corporate layoffs through November, though head winds loom — this week, industrial heavyweight 3M announced it would cut about 1,500 jobs worldwide, and key Boeing suppliers have announced cuts as well. The manufacturing sector was in a recession in 2019, but that pain has not spread to the service sector.

“With the economy as stable as it is, it would take a very large shock indeed to materially alter the economy’s basic trajectory,” Eric Winograd, a senior economist at AllianceBernstein, said in a note to clients."

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said in a speech from the White House streamed online by economic clubs around the country that the economy was the strongest on record before the coronavirus pandemic, again promising vigorous economic growth if he is given another four years in office. He also sought to stir up fear about what a victory by Joe Biden and other Democrats would mean for the U.S.

""The policies of the left would unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions,"" Mr. Trump said, claiming that a Democratic win would lead to sharply higher taxes and ""destroy our country.""

""We will go into depression,"" the president said.

Less growth than advertised

Economists do not echo Mr. Trump's prediction of doom. Last month, an economic forecast from Moody's predicted that Biden's economic plan would result in ""more jobs, a stronger economy and higher incomes for the middle class"" than Trump's.

In fact, economic growth under Mr. Trump has fallen short of what he promised four years ago. Instead of rising 3.5% annually, the country's gross domestic product in the first three years of his term has risen by an average of 2.6%. Battered by the fallout from COVID-19, employers also have cut 10.5 million jobs in the past six months. Even before the pandemic, however, annual job growth never reached 2.5 million and dropped by nearly 200,000 in 2019.

On Wednesday Mr. Trump said that the economy was recovering jobs lost during the lockdowns 23 times faster than in the recovery that followed the Great Recession. He also predicted the economy would add 10 million jobs in the first six months of 2021. That pace of hiring would lift employment roughly back to where it was pre-pandemic by the middle next year.

Mr. Trump also touted his success on trade, saying he had replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, ended the Transpacific Partnership and negotiated better trade terms with China.

""If I don't get elected … China will own the United States,"" Mr. Trump said.

No word on stimulus checks or jobless aid

Notably absent from Mr. Trump's speech was any mention of another round of fiscal stimulus. Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on the need for more government spending to help speed the recovery.

In a response to a question after the speech, Mr. Trump said he favors more stimulus money for certain industries, like the airlines. But he said nothing about another round of cash payments to Americans or restarting enhanced unemployment benefits.

Last week, Mr. Trump called off talks over a spending bill with Democrats, but on Tuesday he tweeted his support for significant stimulus spending, urging Congress to ""go big or go home."""

Tures

The most repeated phrase of the Republican National Convention was that President Donald Trump created the greatest economy the world has ever seen. The evidence, however, shows that it’s not the greatest in world’s history, or American history. It may not be even better than the Obama economy, even before the pandemic devastated our economy.

GDP Growth: I went to Macrotrends.net to gather all of the data on annual growth rates from 1961 to 2019, before the pandemic. In his best year, 2018, Trump’s growth rate was 3.18 percent, good for 29th best since JFK took office. In 2019, the GDP growth rate was 2.33 percent (41st best) and in 2017, it was 2.22 percent (44th best) out of all 59 years. In 1950, our first quarter GDP growth rate was 16.7 percent, according to Trading Economics.

And that’s before 2020. The Bureau of Economic Analysis revealed that our economy shrank by 5 percent during the first quarter, and a historic low -32 percent in the second quarter, as confirmed by Trading Economics.

Unemployment: President Barack Obama inherited the Great Recession, which began at the end of the George W. Bush administration. The unemployment rate was 9.9 percent in 2009. It declined every year down to 4.7 percent in 2016, according to Forbes. It has further declined under Trump to 3.5 percent in 2019 but then shot up to 14.7 percent in April in the midst of the pandemic. As of this writing, it is still in the double-digits.

Annual Median Household Income: As the Joint Economic Committee concluded: “During the last two years of the Obama administration, annual median household income increased $4,800. This is three times more than the $1,400 increase during the first two years of the Trump administration.” And this was published before the declines of 2020.

Stock Market: I expected that the stock market would have done better for Trump than Obama. I was incorrect. According to the JEC: “Between President Trump’s Inauguration Day and November 2019, the Dow Jones Average increased more than 40 percent, while over the eight years of the Obama administration, the DJIA increased almost 150 percent – a substantially greater pace.” The stock market had declined so much before Obama took office, so his numbers look better primarily for this reason.

Trade Deficit: Given his rhetoric on the trade and all of his claims to success. I was surprised to discover that under Trump the trade deficit became worse than it did under the Obama administration. “Despite his aggressive trade moves, the total monthly trade deficit in goods and services — that is, the value of goods and services exported by the US minus the value of imports — has gotten larger in the last couple years,” confirms Business Insider.

There is no evidence at the writing of this column that this was the greatest economy in the history of the world, or America, over even the last several years. Times had been generally okay since the Great Recession of 2007-09 for both presidents, until the calamity of 2020.

No matter how the Democrats and their media allies attempt to qualify it, that was the biggest GDP surge ever. It beat the previous historic high of 16.7% in the first quarter of 1950, as well as the third-quarter estimate of 32% from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

President Trump’s economic policies are continuing to make miracles, despite all the fear-mongering, skepticism, and negativity coming from the Democrats and their allies in the liberal media.

Some media sources are already reporting this historic number with the caveat that we still have a long way to go to recover to fully recover. Well, of course, we do.

US ECONOMIC GROWTH SHATTERS RECORD AT 33.1%, BUT FAILS TO SNAP CORONAVIRUS RECESSION

But the real news isn’t how far we have to go; it’s how quickly and how far we’ve come notwithstanding the fact that we are still in the pandemic and a number of states are still imposing restrictions on economic activities.

It wasn’t just a spectacular number, it is the best quarter of economic growth on record and a testament to both the vitality of America’s private sector and the policies the Trump administration implemented, first on a bipartisan basis with Congress and then on its own, following state governments across the country shutting down large swaths of their economies.

WILL A RECORD GDP SURGE BOOST TRUMP'S REELECTION ODDS?

As I have said before, there are two main reasons why we were witnessing this economic miracle.

First, the growth-oriented policies of the Trump administration, including middle-class tax cuts and a historic rollback of job-killing regulations, gave the U.S. economy unprecedented momentum heading into the pandemic.

TRUMP COULD CUT TAXES BY $1.1T OVER NEXT DECADE IF REELECTED, STUDY SHOWS

Second, the president’s emergency economic relief legislation, including the Paycheck Protection Program, unemployment benefits, and direct taxpayer assistance, helped boost consumer spending which accounts for about two-thirds of our economic growth.

For the second time in less than four years, President Trump has successfully lifted the U.S. economy out of stagnation, finding solutions to two very different crises.

Of course, the left will never give President Trump the credit he rightfully deserves for this remarkable economic milestone. Even before the GDP figure was announced on Thursday morning, the liberal media and their platoon of partisan pundits were frantically trying to discredit an economic report that they haven’t even read.

“The US economy probably grew at record speed in the third quarter. But the crisis isn't over,” CNN Business wrote in a two-sentence headline the day before the report.

Around the same time, NPR observed on its website that the “blockbuster” GDP report should not be viewed with too much optimism. “On its surface, economic growth data out this week will look like one for the record books,” the publication wrote. “But dig in, and the picture is not as bright.”

Not to be outdone, NBC News also published its own “analysis” of the ongoing economic resurgence, offering a “reality check” to the claim the country witnessed the fastest GDP growth in history.

And the full list of similar opinion columns disguised as articles that were published ahead of the GDP report goes on.

All of these desperate criticisms boil down to a single weak objection — you shouldn’t celebrate our ongoing economic rebound for as long as America battles the coronavirus. And what that argument really means is that any positive economic development, no matter how sensational and record-setting it may be, must be ignored while President Trump is in the White House.

Of course, even if there were no new coronavirus cases across America, the biased media would refuse to applaud the President’s policies, and insist that the White House should have handled the outbreak differently.

The biggest question the American people should ask themselves before they vote on November 3 is whether it is in our nation’s best interests to abandon Donald Trump’s proven formula for economic prosperity. Clearly, it is not.

For the second time in less than four years, President Trump has successfully lifted the U.S. economy out of stagnation, finding solutions to two very different crises.

As our historic third-quarter economic growth attests, the proof is in the pudding -- no one is better equipped to steer America toward prosperity in the next four years than Donald Trump.

Members of the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, along with hundreds of distinguished guests, attended the nationally televised address in the House chamber.

“The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society,” the President said during his opening remarks. “One where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise.”

In his speech, President Trump discussed a variety of topics, such as the economy, healthcare, education, global affairs, and national security. He also mentioned a variety of distinguished guests who were in the audience during his speech, such as Janiyah Davis, a fourth-grader from Philadelphia who the President awarded with a scholastic scholarship that evening.

""America is a land of heroes. This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life,"" the President said as he concluded his speech. ""America is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true.”

While this is the fourth time President Trump has addressed a joint session of Congress, this is his third State of the Union Address. There is typically no State of the Union Address by a new president in their first year in office. President John F. Kennedy is the only exception, as he delivered a State of the Union Address during his first year in office in 1961.

Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution requires the President to “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” While the Constitution does not specify how often such an address should be given, presidents traditionally deliver the State of the Union Address once a year.

86,How Trump Has Undermined the Wisconsin Economy - Center for American Progress Action - Center for American Progress Action Fund,How Trump Has Undermined the Wisconsin Economy - Center for American Progress Action  Center for American Progress Action Fund,"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FucHJvZ3Jlc3NhY3Rpb24ub3JnL2FydGljbGUvdHJ1bXAtdW5kZXJtaW5lZC13aXNjb25zaW4tZWNvbm9teS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Center for American Progress Action Fund,"In the election season of 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump visited Wisconsin nine times to speak with potential voters at town hall events and rallies.1 At an event in Eau Claire just a few days before the general election, Trump told a crowd, “America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary’s NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]”—and promised, “That’s going to be changed around.”2

Yet nearly three years after Trump’s inauguration, the data increasingly show that the administration has not helped working-class Wisconsinites; in fact, its policies have only exacerbated economic issues in Wisconsin—especially in areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election.

2018 started with a trade war prompted by the Trump administration levying tariffs on countries across the globe, from European, Asian, and North American allies, to China, an economic rival. Estimating the costs of tariffs to consumers is difficult, but based on the most recent policy announcements from the White House, one study suggests that the average family paid an additional $1,315 in 2019 alone.3 Many working-class Americans will surely notice tighter budgets if they haven’t already. Even so, only certain areas will feel the majority of the economic pain, which stems from job losses and factory closures. States in the Upper Midwest, such as Wisconsin, are bearing the brunt of his chaotic policies.

First, consider mass layoffs: Under Wisconsin state law, employers who plan to lay off employees en masse must submit advance written notice to the Department of Workforce Development. In the two years leading up to the start of the trade war, 15,154 workers were affected by mass layoffs in Wisconsin. In the two years following, that number jumped to 18,949 workers—a 25 percent increase.4

The Trump administration claims that its trade policies will help the country, but many experts disagree. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, noted recently, “To argue that this [the trade war] isn’t doing economic damage is just wrong.” These effects are evident in Wisconsin.5

In terms of private employment:

Wisconsin added 136,200 jobs under President Barack Obama’s second term. Under Trump’s presidency so far, that figure is only 57,500. 6

In the two years since the Trump administration’s trade war began, Wisconsin added 25,200 jobs—less than half as many as in the two preceding years. 7

Under Obama’s second term, Wisconsin experienced a 5.71 percent increase in job growth. So far under Trump’s presidency, that figure stands at just 2.27 percent, with significant deceleration starting soon after the trade war began.8

Moreover, Wisconsin’s overall seasonally adjusted unemployment rate had been steadily decreasing for the four years prior to Trump’s election and continued to do so until almost immediately after the trade war began. Now, the rate sits at a nearly three-year high of 3.4 percent—0.6 percentage points higher than it was in the middle of 2019.9 As the Trump administration continues to pursue open-ended trade policies, Wisconsin workers are hurting.

While average families are noticing higher prices for essential goods, the wealthy have received outsize benefits from the Trump administration’s tax cuts passed in the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that in 2020, the richest 1 percent in Wisconsin will receive an average tax break of $39,610—more than 98 times larger than the average tax break of $403 given to the bottom 60 percent of Wisconsinites.10

Disparities exist even within the state, as the effects of the trade war, tax cuts, and this administration’s overall economic policies have hit some parts of Wisconsin particularly hard. The three Wisconsin metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that favored Obama in the 2012 election and Trump in 2016 have been faring particularly poorly since Trump entered the White House: Eau Claire, Racine, and Oshkosh-Neenah.

Eau Claire

The Eau Claire MSA, which includes Chippewa and Eau Claire counties, favored Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections but voted for Donald Trump in 2016. During Obama’s final years in office, the unemployment rate was steadily decreasing, and the Trump administration inherited much of that economic momentum. Yet the Trump administration’s economic policies are starting to reverse this trend.

The monthly change in the Eau Claire metropolitan area’s unemployment rate stopped decreasing in March 2019, became positive in June 2019, and has been increasing ever since. In December 2019, the last month for which data are available, the unemployment rate stood at 3.5 percent—up 0.8 percentage points from the yearly low of 2.7 percent and the highest it’s been since 2016.11

In addition to the rise in the unemployment rate, the labor force has actually started to shrink. Prior to the Trump administration’s trade war, the size of the labor force stayed the same or increased in each month of his presidency. In 16 of the 24 months following the initiation of the trade war, there was monthly decline, and the labor force in December 2019 was down more than 700 people since its peak in February of 2018.12

The Trump administration also incentivized offshoring through the TCJA.13 Ten mass layoffs have occurred in the Eau Claire area since the Trump administration initiated the trade war, affecting at least 410 workers.14 Radial, an operational services multinational corporation headquartered in Pennsylvania, operated a call center in Eau Claire with 142 employees. On March 26, 2019, Radial submitted a notice required by the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act to alert the state that the Eau Claire center would close permanently.15

Several other firms, including Syverson, Bon-Ton Stores, Schuman, Shopko, Iron Mountain Trap Rock Co., Intel Corp., and US Bank, have all joined Radial in issuing WARN Act notifications in Eau Claire since the trade war began.16

Racine

Racine, another metro area that favored Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016, has likewise experienced economic distress since the start of the Trump administration’s trade war. The Racine MSA saw its unemployment rate drop from 7.4 percent at the beginning of Obama’s second term to 3.4 percent at the end of it.17

Yet the Trump administration’s trade policies and corporate tax cuts have reversed this trend in the Racine MSA. After a decline in the unemployment rate that had lasted for years—a trend that long preceded the 2016 election— Racine has more recently seen a significant upswing in the unemployment rate since the second quarter of 2019. In December 2019, the unemployment rate sat at 4.3 percent—1 full percentage point higher than the low of 3.3 percent experienced in April 2019.18

Similar trends are apparent in the Racine metro area’s labor force: Its size peaked in August 2017 at slightly more than 100,000 after roughly 18 months of consistency. Today, it sits below 99,000 and looks likely to continue decreasing.19

Racine has also been negatively affected by the wave of mass layoffs in Wisconsin. Since the trade war started, 10 mass layoffs have occurred in the metro area, affecting at least 452 workers.20 One such mass layoff, initiated by Cordstrap USA, which makes strapping for cargo-securing systems, is emblematic of the decline in manufacturing activity in Wisconsin. Moreover, the layoff highlights the Trump administration’s shortcomings on the promise of restoring the manufacturing sector. Cordstrap opened its Racine metro manufacturing plant in 2000, but now, amid an uncertain trade climate, the multinational corporation has decided to move its production facilities overseas.21

Oshkosh-Neenah

The Oshkosh-Neenah metro area, which comprises Winnebago County, is the third Wisconsin MSA that voted for Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. Like the Eau Claire and Racine MSAs, Oshkosh-Neenah has been severely affected by the Trump administration’s trade policies. Six mass layoffs have affected at least 257 workers in the metro area since the beginning of 2017.22

Kimberly-Clark—a fabric manufacturing firm—closed two locations over this time period, leaving 65 workers jobless.23 Silver Star Brands, an electronic shopping and mail-order service, likewise closed shop in Oshkosh, noting that it decided to outsource the 62 jobs that it cut.24

And just like the other Wisconsin Obama-Trump MSAs, Oshkosh-Neenah has recently experienced an increase in its unemployment rate and a decrease in the size of its labor force. December 2019 saw an unemployment rate of 3.1 percent—a 0.6 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate compared with the low of 2.5 percent reached in June 2019.25 The Oshkosh-Neenah labor force has shrunk by 2,300 from its peak of more than 94,100 workers immediately after Trump assumed office to a slightly less than 92,000 workers in December of 2019.26

Conclusion

Trump entered office with promises to help forgotten communities and workers, including in Wisconsin. Yet the economic data tell a different story—one of increased unemployment, discouraged workers, and mass layoffs. Unfortunately, it is the voters who helped elect Trump who are most negatively affected by his administration’s economic policies.

The Nov. 3 election between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden will give American voters a choice between two candidates with drastically different views of the world and divergent approaches to tackling some of the biggest issues facing the country. Here is a detailed look at their policies and proposals in seven key areas.

Economy The coronavirus pandemic put tens of millions of Americans out of work, ended the longest U.S. economic recovery on record and undermined a key argument for President Donald Trump’s re-election.

Reopening the economy Cautious Cautioned against reopening without ramping up testing. Yes Pushed states to reopen as quickly as possible, even as infections spiked.

Putting the economy back on track Trillions more Has proposed spending trillions to create new jobs in clean energy, manufacturing and caregiving, and to ease racial economic inequality. Wants Washington to offer states more support in paying for unemployment benefits and says households - as well as local governments - need more support to get through the shutdown. Onetime stimulus Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Trump has signed legislation to flush the economy with trillions of dollars in onetime aid to businesses, individuals and local governments. Hasn’t stood behind a fresh round of stimulus measures, and called for federal funding to be cut to cities and states that don’t crack down on protesters. Supports deferring payroll taxes for a temporary boost to paychecks.

Taxes and wages Raise minimum wage Has criticized the Trump administration’s 2017 tax cuts as giving too many benefits to the wealthy and corporations. Pledges to reverse some of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts by raising the marginal tax rate on the highest income earners back to 39.6% from 37%. Supports raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25 and expanding some tax credits for lower-income workers. No to raising taxes Touts his 2017 tax cuts as an example of his approach to stimulating economic growth. Deferring payroll taxes would temporarily boost paychecks of most working Americans. The Trump campaign is attacking the policy of raising taxes while the economy struggles to recover and the deficit rises.

Trade Boost domestic manufacturing Proposed his own made-in-America manufacturing plan in July. He pledged to spend $700 billion on American-made products and industrial research, which he said would give at least 5 million more people a paycheck during a job-killing pandemic. Criticizes Trump’s tariff war with China as bad for U.S. consumers and farmers. Voted for NAFTA as a senator. Boost domestic manufacturing In a return to a core issue of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump is telling voters he wants to boost domestic manufacturing. Says America’s difficulties in procuring medical supplies internationally during the pandemic are another reason to encourage U.S. companies to avoid offshoring.

Green investments $2 trillion over four years Said he would spend $2 trillion over four years to improve infrastructure, create zero-emissions public transportation, build sustainable homes and create clean-energy jobs. Little appetite Advocates more spending on U.S. roads, bridges and airports, too, but has signaled little appetite for making “green” investments.

COVID-19 The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 220,000 Americans and infected nearly 9 million people in the country. The Trump administration has allocated tens of billions of dollars to develop vaccines and therapies, expand testing and buy protective gear. It has mostly called upon state officials to deploy the funds and create their own strategies and plans to bring down infection rates and deaths.

Enforce mask wearing Yes Has said he will push for mandatory mask-wearing across the country through orders by governors and mayors, and by asking Americans to wear them when they are with people outside their households. Has set an example by wearing masks at events throughout his campaign. No Has left it up to states and localities to set their own mask policies and said Americans can wear them voluntarily. Has not pushed mask wearing at the White House or campaign rallies. Has largely dismissed masks, saying “maybe they’re great” but also “maybe they’re not so good.”

Vaccine development Yes Says will invest $25 billion in manufacturing and distribution to get the vaccine to every American, at no cost. Emphasizes that he will trust scientists to decide on vaccine safety and efficacy, that clinical data be released, and ensure that researchers can report on and testify to Congress on the vaccine. Yes Has committed more than $10 billion to accelerate vaccine development and purchase hundreds of millions of doses, promising to make vaccines free. Set expectations high for a vaccine before the election and accused U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists of holding up the process for political reasons.

Testing strategy Coordinated response Advocates for a coordinated response between the federal government and states that would include at least 10 mobile testing sites and drive-through facilities per state. Says he will set up a Pandemic Testing Board to increase the production and distribution of tests, and make tests free. Also wants to build a national contract tracing workforce. States in charge Allocated $26 billion to testing and contact tracing, of which about $11 billion went to states and tribal communities. Set up dozens of drive-through testing locations, but most were shut down by June, saying the testing funds provided to states are enough. Provided supplemental testing sites to some COVID-19 “hot spots.” About 1 million COVID-19 diagnostic tests are now conducted daily, compared with a target of nearly 6 million tests per day.

Race and criminal justice Trump and Biden have contrasting views and records on criminal justice and the U.S. racial divide, issues that have risen in prominence in the 2020 election.

Diversity and inclusion Promises diversity Has pledged that his Cabinet, judicial appointments and running mate will reflect the country’s diversity. Few Black advisers Has very few Black Americans among his advisers and White House staff.

Policing Reform qualified immunity Has accused the Trump administration of lax oversight of police departments accused of civil rights violations. Supports reforming qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields officers from victims’ lawsuits. Trump’s spokeswoman has said he would not support ending that immunity. Has resisted activist calls to “defund the police,” instead promising to invest $300 million in a program that gives grants to hire more diverse officers and train them to develop less adversarial relationships with communities. “Law and order” Responded to the nationwide protests over the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody by urging a militaristic response. Signed an executive order to take steps toward police reform. It encourages police to use the latest standards for use of force, banning chokeholds unless an officer’s life was in danger, and called for legislation to do more. Democrats faulted the order for allowing some exceptions to the chokehold ban and placing no restrictions on warrants that let police enter a suspect’s property without knocking.

Criminal justice reform Yes Wants to eliminate the death penalty, solitary confinement and jailing accused criminals until they pay a cash bail. Has pledged $20 billion in grants for states to reduce social ills like illiteracy and child abuse in exchange for scaling back mandatory-minimum sentences. As a senator, Biden voted for a 1994 crime bill that critics see contributing to the mass incarceration of Black Americans. Yes In 2018 signed into law the First Step Act, a bipartisan measure reducing mandatory-minimum sentences, expanding drug treatment programs for prisoners and allowing some prisoners to finish their sentences early with good behavior. Has also supported some “tough-on-crime” policies that disproportionately affect minorities, including seeking to restart executions of federal death row inmates.

Addressing racial economic disparities Yes Calls for laws making it easier to sue over wage discrimination. Says will create new fair-lending and fair-housing protections, provide $300 million in grants to cities that reduce discriminatory zoning regulations and create a task force to address the disproportionate deaths of Black people from COVID-19. Says he would have a group study the feasibility of paying cash reparations to Black people as a result of slavery and segregation. Economic growth for all Often touts Black unemployment rate, which hit the lowest levels on record before the coronavirus pandemic, when talking about his policies on race. Has offered few targeted policy proposals to recover the jobs lost since then.

Support for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) Yes Plans to make public colleges and universities tuition-free to most students would apply to public HBCUs. He would also invest more than $70 billion in the schools to start research institutes and for tuition support. Yes Signed a law that the White House said made $255 million in funding for HBCUs permanent and increased money for the federal Pell Grant program. The administration also touts a relaunched HBCU Capital Finance Board, legislation adding money for scholarships and research at HBCUs.

Healthcare Healthcare was already a top concern among U.S. voters even before the coronavirus pandemic killed more than 200,000 Americans. The crisis is likely to shine an even brighter spotlight on the vast differences on healthcare policy between the two candidates.

Obamacare Yes Has vowed to bolster the ACA. Biden’s proposed healthcare plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years and would be financed by increasing taxes on the wealthy, according to his campaign. Does not support a single-payer system like Medicare for All. Instead calls for a Medicare-like public option that would serve as an alternative, not a replacement, for private insurance. No Has used executive power and the courts to undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare, after years of failed attempts by Republican lawmakers to repeal it. Has not proposed a comprehensive replacement, despite Trump’s vow to deliver a better, less-costly healthcare system.

Lower drug prices Yes Supports a bill approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives last year that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, as private insurers do. The Trump administration has said it would veto the bill, saying it would force drug makers to spend less on research and development. Supports some form of importing prescription drugs from foreign countries to lower costs. Yes Signed an executive order to base the price of some Medicare drugs on the cost in foreign countries, where medicines tend to be cheaper, but implementation will require lengthy rulemaking that will likely be challenged in court by drugmakers. Supports some form of importing prescription drugs from foreign countries to lower costs.

Medicare/Medicaid expansion Yes Proposes lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60. Such a change would potentially extend Medicare funding to some 20 million more Americans. No Supports imposing work requirements and other limitations on Medicaid eligibility, as well as placing caps on Medicaid spending growth and converting Medicaid to block grants — all moves that experts say would result in fewer people covered.

Immigration Trump’s push to crack down on illegal immigration and reshape legal immigration was at the heart of his 2016 victory and has remained at the forefront of his White House agenda. Biden promises to rescind most of those policies and advance his own platform if he becomes the president.

Limit immigration during the COVID-19 pandemic No Has said that immigrants help grow the economy and create jobs. Has said he would pause deportations for 100 days after taking office, but has not said if he would immediately reverse Trump’s sweeping pandemic-related restrictions. Yes Dramatically curtailed immigration and travel into the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing the steps were needed for health reasons and to protect jobs for U.S. workers. Trump has restricted the entry of many foreign workers and immigrants seeking permanent residency, and implemented a public health emergency policy that allows U.S. officials to rapidly deport migrants caught at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“Dreamers” Protect DACA Opposed Trump’s “cruel” decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects from deportation immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, popularly known as Dreamers. Biden would make Dreamers eligible for federal student aid for college and would back legislation that provides a path to citizenship for them as part of efforts to do so for all of the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, including those who did not arrive as children. End DACA The Supreme Court ruled in June against Trump’s 2017 decision to end the DACA program, calling the termination “arbitrary and capricious,” but left the administration the option to try again to end it. The Trump administration issued a memo in July that clamped down on the program, blocking new enrollment and allowing only renewals that last one year, down from the current two-year period.

The U.S.-Mexico border wall No Said in August that he would not tear down border walls built under Trump, but would stop additional construction. His plan would end the diversion of Pentagon funding to build the wall and focus instead on border enforcement like investments in improving the screening infrastructure at ports of entry. Yes The Trump administration says it has completed nearly 400 miles of border wall by late October, with a goal of 450 miles by the end of the year, but nearly all of those barriers replaced existing structures. Mexico has refused to pay for any of the construction, leaving the U.S. government to foot the bill, partially with billions of dollars in Pentagon funds. Federal court records show the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to seize land for the wall.

Family separation Reunite families Says would end the prosecution of parents for minor immigration violations, which he calls an “intimidation tactic,” and make it a priority to reunite any children still separated from their families. Separated thousands of families Trump’s 2018 “zero-tolerance” policy to prosecute illegal border crossings led to several thousand children being forcibly separated from parents and legal guardians detained on the Mexico border. The policy, described by the administration as a deterrent, sparked outrage, and the backlash led Trump to sign an executive order to end the practice. But the administration continued to separate hundreds of kids traveling with other adult relatives.

Travel ban No Promises to rescind the travel bans, calling them an abuse of power designed to discriminate against black and brown immigrants. Yes Signed an executive order banning entry to immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, a move Biden and other critics said was discriminatory. A federal court blocked the initial ban, but in 2018 the Supreme Court upheld an amended version that has since been expanded to other countries.

Climate change The election pits Biden, who plans to tie the country’s economic recovery to tackling climate change, against Trump, who is determined to remove as many regulatory hurdles to oil, gas and coal production as possible.

Climate plans Yes Proposes $2 trillion in spending over his first four-year term and aims to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035, heeding calls from his party’s progressives for a faster transition away from fossil fuels. In the last presidential debate, Biden said he would “transition from the oil industry” – he later said he was referring to a plan to kill subsidies for the fuels. Supports research into advanced nuclear energy. No Does not have a climate plan on his campaign website, but an energy and environment section highlights his administration’s rescinding of Obama-era regulations. Has rejected mainstream science on climate. In September, he refused to acknowledge any role climate change has played in deadly wildfires that swept through the U.S. West Coast. Like Biden, he supports advanced nuclear technology.

Tougher auto emissions rules Yes Wants to strengthen auto emission standards formed during the Obama administration. Proposes incentives for auto manufacturers to produce zero-emission cars, a federal procurement program for clean vehicles and set a goal for all new American-built buses to be zero-emissions by 2030. No Has called the Obama administration’s auto emission standards “industry killing,” and replaced them with weaker ones in March.

Ban on coal, fracking Cautious Has resisted a push by his party’s liberal wing to impose a nationwide ban on fracking though he proposes banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters. Fracking increases emissions of gases linked to climate change but supports jobs across the country, and has allowed the United States to become the world’s top oil and gas producer. Supports investing in coal communities by offering alternatives to mining work. No Envisions a renaissance in “beautiful clean coal,” the fuel that emits the most carbon dioxide when burned. But due to abundant natural gas and falling prices for wind and solar power, he has failed to stop coal plant shutdowns during his term in office. Also focused on protecting drilling and other fossil fuel industries, a major source of blue-collar jobs.

Climate diplomacy Yes Has said he would return the United States to a leadership role on climate change, re-entering the United States in future climate negotiations to advance the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which brought countries together to mitigate global warming. No Put in motion a process to remove the United States, the world’s No. 2 emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, from the Paris agreement, saying it was too costly.

Foreign policy Trump won the 2016 election promising to put “America First,” overturn what he said were unfair trade deals and force U.S. allies to pay more toward joint defense measures. Biden pledges to restore U.S. global leadership and reverse many of Trump’s foreign policy actions.

U.S.-China relations Global pressure on China Has called Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic a historic blunder. Argues that China relishes a chaotic Trump administration, his alienation of American allies, and his abdication of U.S. leadership roles in global institutions, such as the World Health Organization. Says he will correct this by bringing multilateral pressure to bear on China through renewed relations with U.S. allies. Stand up to Beijing Entered into a high-stakes trade war with China before reaching a partial trade deal in January. Trump has since shut the door on negotiations, saying he was unhappy with Beijing’s handling of the pandemic. In July, Trump issued an executive order to end the United States’ special commercial treatment of Hong Kong after Beijing imposed national security legislation on the former British colony, and his administration abruptly told China to close its Houston consulate amid accusations of spying.

Iran nuclear deal Yes, with conditions Says he would deal with Iran through diplomacy and re-enter the nuclear agreement, but only if Iran first returned to compliance with the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear program. No Pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal reached with Iran, European nations and Russia during the Obama administration.

U.S. military in the Middle East Yes, but with narrowed focus Proposes a narrower focus for the U.S. military in the region on counterterrorism and working with local allies. Has said the strike that killed the powerful Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani “put the United States and Iran on a collision course.” Wants to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, which Trump has defended. Mixed Has questioned the benefits of U.S. military interventions in the Middle East, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but sent more troops to the region after the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal increased tensions. In January, after Iranian proxies and U.S. forces clashed in Iraq, he ordered a strike that killed Soleimani.

Afghanistan Bring troops home Has said he will bring the vast majority of U.S. troops home from Afghanistan and narrowly focus the mission there on fighting al Qaeda and Islamic State. Full military withdrawal Has said he wants a full military withdrawal from Afghanistan to end America’s longest war, and posited that remaining troops should be “home by Christmas” – although a top adviser has said Washington would reduce its forces to 2,500 by early next year. In February, the Trump administration reached a deal with the Taliban on phased U.S. force reductions, but it was dependent on the Islamist militant group meeting conditions. Escalating violence since then has raised questions about whether Trump can bring all U.S. troops home anytime soon.

Meeting North Korea’s leader No, unless preconditions are met Biden has accused Trump of giving away U.S. leverage over the North Korean regime for little in return and said he would not meet Kim without preconditions. Yes Trump met with North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong Un three times in 2018 and 2019, but efforts to get Kim to abandon the country’s nuclear weapons program have stalled.

Alliances Yes Says will strengthen alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which Biden says would undo damage to American leadership and credibility inflicted by Trump. Has warned that Russia, China and others who try to interfere in U.S. elections will face serious consequences if he is elected president. Will revisit the issue of U.S. troops in Germany. No Has angered NATO members and other U.S. allies, while refusing to criticize Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin, even when U.S. intelligence officials concluded the Russian military had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Trump announced in June that he would reduce the number of U.S. troops in Germany by about 9,500.

Tech The regulation of big technology companies such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

Breaking up Big Tech Maybe Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly Obama administration, has said he would seriously look at the idea of dismantling companies like Facebook, but stopped short of calling for them to be broken up. Biden has also proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc. Maybe The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies, but has stopped short of calling for them to be broken up. The Justice Department sued Google in October, accusing the Internet company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals. Trump regularly bashes Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, and meets with Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook. When asked about big tech companies, Trump has said “there is something going on in terms of monopoly.”

Regulating social media Yes Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its stance on political ads, was the only Democratic presidential candidate who called for revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that largely exempts online platforms like Facebook and Twitter from legal liability for users’ posts. Biden has called for Facebook to fact-check politicians’ ads in the two weeks ahead of the presidential election. Yes Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused social media companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives. After Twitter put fact-checking labels on two of Trump’s tweets for the first time in May, the president signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms’ content moderation decisions and he backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230. Experts said the executive order was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny.

Stronger data privacy protections Yes Has said the U.S. should set privacy “standards not unlike the Europeans,” an apparent reference to the European Union’s stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Mixed Has signaled support for a federal consumer privacy legislation Has criticized Silicon Valley over the issue of encryption and blasted Apple for what he called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals. Has also stepped up efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps, such as ordering the sale of TikTok’s U.S. arm. Privacy advocates have slammed the Trump administration for actions they say violate immigrants’ privacy and for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of data.

Fixing the digital divide Yes Plans a $20 billion investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations. Yes The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband. Trump has said he is committed to ensuring “every citizen can have high-speed internet access.” In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund."

As the 2020 election draws nearer, President Trump and his surrogates are doubling down on that assertion, including by calling attention to what he has deemed “the biggest deal ever seen”: the “phase one” trade deal with China. The agreement reportedly includes a Chinese commitment to purchase an additional $200 billion in American goods above 2017 levels by the end of 2021.

A September 2019 study by Moody’s Analytics found that the trade war had already cost the U.S. economy nearly 300,000 jobs and an estimated 0.3% of real GDP. Other studies put the cost to U.S. GDP at about 0.7%. A 2019 report from Bloomberg Economics estimated that the trade war would cost the U.S. economy $316 billion by the end of 2020, while more recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University found that U.S. companies lost at least $1.7 trillion in the price of their stocks as a result of U.S. tariffs imposed on imports from China.

The trade war caused economic pain on both sides and led to diversion of trade flows away from both China and the United States. As described by Heather Long at the Washington Post, “U.S. economic growth slowed, business investment froze, and companies didn’t hire as many people. Across the nation, a lot of farmers went bankrupt, and the manufacturing and freight transportation sectors have hit lows not seen since the last recession. Trump’s actions amounted to one of the largest tax increases in years.”

President Trump launched the trade war to pressure Beijing to implement significant changes to aspects of its economic system that facilitate unfair Chinese trade practices, including forced technology transfer, limited market access, intellectual property theft, and subsidies to state-owned enterprises. Trump argued that unilateral tariffs would shrink the U.S. trade deficit with China and cause companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Between July 2018 and August 2019, the United States announced plans to impose tariffs on more than $550 billion of Chinese products, and China retaliated with tariffs on more than $185 billion of U.S. goods.

Upon entering office, Trump sought to engage Beijing directly to address structural concerns about China’s economic policies. Just three months into his administration, he met with Chinese leader Xí Jìnpíng 习近平 at Mar-a-Largo, where they agreed to establish a 100-Day Action Plan to resolve trade differences. The next month, China agreed to open its economy (slightly) to U.S. firms and services in exchange for greater Chinese access on bilateral trade and U.S. recognition of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Yet follow-on negotiations fizzled as Washington pushed Beijing for more concessions and Beijing rebuffed American pressure. The 100 days concluded in July 2017 with no agreement, no press conference, and no joint statement out of the first meeting of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue (which was declared dead by the Trump administration four months later).

During the 2016 presidential campaign, a consistent refrain from then-candidate Trump was to point to U.S. trade with China, and the agreements that enabled it, as a primary cause of the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs and intellectual property. He said China was responsible for “the greatest theft in the history of the world” and lambasted the U.S. trade deficit with China, which in 2016 stood at around $346 billion . He declared, “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country.” Building on the image of Donald Trump as the ultimate dealmaker, his campaign released a strategy to reform the U.S.-China trade relationship , in which it pledged to “cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.” Trump laid out a four-part plan to secure a better deal with China: declare China a currency manipulator; confront China on intellectual property and forced technology transfer concerns; end China’s use of export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards; and lower America’s corporate tax rate to make U.S. manufacturing more competitive.

Six months after the deal was inked, the costs and benefits of this agreement are coming into clearer focus. Despite Trump’s claim that “trade wars are good, and easy to win,” the ultimate results of the phase one trade deal between China and the United States — and the trade war that preceded it — have significantly hurt the American economy without solving the underlying economic concerns that the trade war was meant to resolve. The effects of the trade war go beyond economics, though. Trump’s prioritization on the trade deal and de-prioritization of all other dimensions of the relationship produced a more permissive environment for China to advance its interests abroad and oppress its own people at home, secure in the knowledge that American responses would be muted by a president who was reluctant to risk losing the deal.

Numerous studies have found that U.S. companies primarily paid for U.S. tariffs, with the cost estimated at nearly $46 billion. The tariffs forced American companies to accept lower profit margins, cut wages and jobs for U.S. workers, defer potential wage hikes or expansions, and raise prices for American consumers or companies. A spokesperson for the American Farm Bureau stated that “farmers have lost the vast majority of what was once a $24 billion market in China” as a result of Chinese retaliatory actions.

Meanwhile, the U.S. goods trade deficit with China continued to grow, reaching a record $419.2 billion in 2018. By 2019, the trade deficit had shrunk to $345 billion, roughly the same level as 2016, largely as a result of reduced trade flows. It should be noted that, while the U.S. deficit with China decreased, its overall trade deficit did not. Trump’s unilateral tariffs on China diverted trade flows from China, causing the U.S. trade deficit with Europe, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to increase as a result.

China also felt economic pain as a result of the trade war, though apparently not enough to capitulate to the Trump administration’s core demands for major structural reform. Indeed, as the trade war dragged on, Beijing lowered its tariffs for its other trading partners as it reduced its reliance on U.S. markets. The final deal that both sides announced on January 15, 2020, largely resembled the offer Beijing had put on the table from the start — increased goods purchases plus commitments on improved intellectual property protection, currency, and forced technology transfer.

Missing from the deal was any forward movement on subsidies, state-owned enterprises, and China’s uses of industrial policy to advantage its own firms over foreign competitors. Progress on market access also proved underwhelming outside of the financial sector. These and other challenges were put off for a phase two negotiation, which Trump recently said is not under consideration.

A more permissive environment for Chinese aggression and suppression

Throughout this period, President Trump made efforts to develop a smooth and positive relationship with China — and especially with Xi Jinping — and explained his efforts as serving the purpose of advancing trade negotiations. Trump lauded Xi’s strength and leadership publicly while shying away from points of sharp bilateral friction in private engagements. Instead, Trump reportedly used his private exchanges with Xi to urge him to act on his personal priorities, most of which related to the trade negotiations, and, for a time, North Korea.

In June 2019, Trump reportedly promised Xi Jinping in a private phone call that the United States would refrain from criticizing China over Hong Kong while trade negotiations were ongoing. The following month, Trump said he believed that Xi Jinping had acted “very responsibly” with the protests in Hong Kong, adding, “We’re working on trade deals right now. We’ll see what happens.” He expressed similar sentiments publicly in November when he shied away from criticizing Xi about Hong Kong and linked the issue to trade negotiations, saying, “We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi.” He further said that Xi is “a friend of mine, he’s an incredible guy,” and described the Hong Kong protests as a “complicating factor” in trade talks. On January 10, 2020, when Laura Ingraham on Fox News asked Trump about “the human rights issue in China” and referenced “a million people in reeducation camps, internment camps,” he replied, “Well, I’m riding a fine line, because we’re making…great trade deals.”

John Bolton, then national security adviser, claims that the reasons behind President Trump’s prioritization of a trade deal above other considerations with China were made clear in a private meeting with Xi Jinping at the June 2019 G-20 summit in Japan. According to Bolton, Trump told Xi to go ahead with building camps to detain 1 million or more Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, saying it was exactly the right thing to do, and asked Xi Jinping to help him win the upcoming presidential election by increasing purchases of soybeans and wheat. Trump later challenged Bolton’s characterization of events, tweeting that Bolton’s book “is a compilation of lies and made up stories”; Trump specifically denied Bolton’s claims about Xinjiang. Yet at a campaign rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on February 10, 2020, Trump declared, “Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents.”

Although other members of the Trump administration, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have been outspoken in their criticism of China’s repression at home and aggression abroad, their statements have not been seen in Beijing as a substitute for presidential opprobrium. During this period, the Trump administration did take a wide range of actions against China, including tightening export controls, enhancing investment screening, challenging Chinese technology companies, and blunting the Belt and Road Initiative. In Beijing’s top-down Leninist system, though, the signals that other leaders send to Xi Jinping, and Xi’s responses to those messages, carry significant weight. Neither the United States nor any other country gets to have two foreign policies with China. There only is one. Beijing’s antennae are tuned to the signals that other leaders send.

To be clear, the Chinese leadership owns full responsibility for its recklessly nationalistic actions along its periphery and its brutal suppression at home. Beijing’s decisions to move in its current direction were made simpler, though, by its confidence in Trump’s tight focus on trade and his interest in not allowing other issues to obstruct completion of a deal or derail the deal’s implementation.

Even in the weeks following the signing of the phase one trade deal, President Trump remained focused on reassuring Xi of his support. For weeks, Trump repeatedly praised Xi’s response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 in China. Trump’s tone would not change until the virus took its toll on the United States.

Was the trade war worth it?

The two sides declared a truce in the trade war at an ornate signing ceremony at the White House involving President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liú Hè 刘鹤, the 11th ranked member in the Chinese leadership. Although the full text of the agreement has not been made public, reports say the agreement commits China to purchasing an extra $200 billion in American products over two years above 2017 levels. The text of the agreement that has been made public shows China committing to protect American intellectual property, halt coercive technology transfers, and refrain from using currency devaluation as a trade weapon. It also included an enforcement mechanism that would allow for the imposition of import tariffs if disputes are not resolved.

In the six months since the deal was signed, the prospects of China meeting its purchasing targets have dimmed considerably. According to Bloomberg calculations based on Chinese Customs Administration data, China in the first half of 2020 had purchased only 23% of the total purchase target for the year. While part of this is attributable to trade flow disruptions caused by COVID-19, much of the gap owes to the impracticality of the agreement from the start. In the phase one deal, as described by Brad W. Setser and Dylan Yalbir at the Council on Foreign Relations, China committed to purchasing roughly $60 billion more in U.S. goods than it had in 2017 — roughly $180 billion in U.S. goods this year. Yet U.S. goods exports to China currently are significantly below what they were in 2017.

In other words, Beijing essentially paid for the deal with a promise of a windfall in purchases of American goods. It appears that President Trump accepted an IOU as a declaration of victory.

Time will tell if the innovations in the agreement on enforcement will succeed where others have failed, and much will depend on China’s willingness to translate agreements into law and, crucially, enforce them. Yet the key question for the United States — especially today, as the U.S. economy is in its worst state since the Great Depression as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic — is if the economic costs it paid for those enforcement agreements were worth the billions of dollars lost in value, the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost, the stagnation of U.S. manufacturing, and the devastating effects of the trade war on American farmers.

Ultimately, the phase one agreement disappointed because it, along with the trade war, severely damaged the U.S. economy while failing to make significant progress in fundamentally resolving the structural imbalances of the U.S.-China trade relationship."

He trails on questions of character and most policy issues, like the coronavirus, health care and even crime.

Except one — and it's a big one: Americans in battleground states still trust Trump over Biden on the economy, which often tops the list of decisive issues for voters.

The president's edge on the economy has begun to worry some allies of Biden, who say he needs to do more to neutralize it or Trump could use it to nail down swing voters as Election Day nears. His lead persists even with 8.4 percent unemployment and during a recession that Democrats say has been fueled by Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.

""I do think there's work to do here in connecting the dots,"" said Hari Sevugan, a Democratic campaign veteran who worked for Pete Buttigieg's 2020 campaign and for Barack Obama in 2008. ""We need to do a better job of showing that a failure to deal with the pandemic was a failure to look out for the economy.""

Many voters don't see the issues as connected: Trump enjoys a net approval rating of 3.5 points on his stewardship of the economy in the RealClearPolitics average while getting a net disapproval score of 15 points on his handling of the coronavirus.

While Trump's economic edge has narrowed in national polls, it remains significant in key states likely to decide the election.

In Wisconsin, Trump enjoys a net approval of 8 points on his handling of the economy in a new poll by Marquette Law School. In Florida, Trump leads Biden by 13 points on which candidate is better on the economy, and in Pennsylvania he leads Biden by 10 points on the same question in a pair of NBC/Marist surveys released this week.

""We've done a really good job saying Trump is incompetent at handling just about every other issue,"" Sevugan said. ""The only thing that is his escape hatch is his handling of the economy. Closing off that lane for Trump does a lot of the work of the election.""

Biden steps up his economic message

Biden has delivered two speeches in the last week aimed at diminishing Trump's advantage on the economy. In Wilmington, Delaware, on Sept. 4, he said working Americans continued to suffer because Trump has ""mismanaged the COVID crisis."" On Wednesday in Warren, Michigan, he assailed the president for failing to keep his promise to bring jobs back to the United States.

A Biden adviser said the campaign has cut into Trump's margin on the economy and plans to keep chipping away at it by conveying to voters that when it comes to economic suffering, ""all roads lead back to COVID.""

The adviser, who discussed strategy on condition of anonymity, said Biden doesn't necessarily need to win the argument on the economy given his myriad other advantages. The adviser said breaking even or neutralizing the margin would sufficiently weaken the ""last pillar"" that is ""propping"" Trump up.

Robert Wolf, a Biden donor who founded the holding company 32 Advisors, said the recovery has been ""K-shaped,"" diverging for ""haves and have-nots,"" as opposed to the ""Super-V-shaped"" recovery claimed by Trump administration officials.

""Right now, people are focused a little more on COVID and school reopenings and the recent shootings, but I would agree that the overarching theme is going to be about who is best for the economy,"" he said. ""And I am just hopeful that Joe's messaging breaks through.""

Trump has touted the 1.4 million U.S. jobs added in August as evidence that the economy is on the rebound. It is an unprecedented scenario — the fastest economic collapse followed by one of the sharpest job recoveries in U.S. history, all in an election year.

""You have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in,"" Trump said Tuesday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""Next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in.""

The argument — focus on the past and the future, not the present — highlights the reality that as voters begin to cast ballots, the economy is both Trump's most powerful weapon and his most exposed target.

A big part of his task is to convince the small set of persuadable voters in key states that his record before the crisis shows he'll be better for their pocketbooks than Biden. That requires skipping over six months of shareholder joy and Main Street pain.

'Smoke and mirrors'

But voters can hold complicated sets of views. Biden leads on most substantive issues, and a clear majority of voters think he's more empathetic, honest and trustworthy than Trump. And while most Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic, they don't blame him for the economic fallout.

""For Democrats to contest it, to break even on the economy, is a total win,"" said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist, who said the issue typically favors the GOP.

Trump's other message — that Biden is controlled by anarchists who are inciting violence and crime in major cities — has fallen flat in polls.

Liam Donovan, a lobbyist and former GOP operative, said Trump's ""appeals to law and order definitely resonate with his base"" but probably won't move undecided voters. A positive economic message, however, could be a better closing argument.

""If President Trump is going to win four more years, it is because voters are hopeful about the future, not fearful. After a bumpy 2020, people are looking for some semblance of normalcy or at least hope,"" he said. ""The recent jobs numbers and anticipated GDP data could easily be worked into the argument that things are under control and moving in that direction.""

Rick Tyler, a longtime Republican strategist and outspoken Trump critic, said the president's advantage on the economy exists ""because Trump has told his story and has repeated that story ad nauseam"" that he built the greatest economy in history.

Tyler said Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration and stole credit for the continued pace of growth. And he said Biden needs to stay focused on puncturing Trump's economic narrative and not get ""sucked into"" his distractions.

""It's all smoke and mirrors,"" Tyler said. ""It is a false story, but, nevertheless, when there are no facts [being offered] to refute it, it becomes a truth."""

Now that Donald Trump has been president for three years, what has changed? Here are some things that can be measured:

The economy added 6.7 million jobs, and unemployment fell to the lowest rate in half a century.

The economy grew more slowly than Trump promised — at a 2.1% rate most recently.

Stock prices hit record levels.

Household income grew; poverty decreased, and paychecks grew 2.5% after inflation.

Home prices reached record levels; homeownership increased.

The number of people lacking health insurance rose by nearly 2 million.

Federal deficits soared, adding $2.8 trillion to the national debt.

Analysis

This is our eighth quarterly update of the “Trump’s Numbers” scorecard that we posted in January 2018 and have updated every three months, most recently on October 11. We’ll publish additional updates every three months, as fresh statistics become available.

Here we’ve included statistics that may seem good or bad or just neutral, depending on the reader’s point of view. That’s the way we did it when we posted our first “Obama’s Numbers” article seven years ago — and in the quarterly updates and final summary that followed. And we’ve maintained the same practice under Trump.

Then as now, we make no judgment as to how much credit or blame any president deserves for things that happen during his time in office. Opinions differ on that.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed a bit under Trump, but unemployment dropped to the lowest level in nearly half a century.

Employment —Total nonfarm employment grew by nearly 6.7 million since the president took office, according to the most recent figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That continued an unbroken chain of monthly gains in total employment that started in October 2010. The economy has now added jobs every month for more than nine years, including the first two years and 11 months of the Trump administration.

Yet Trump is far behind the pace needed to fulfill his campaign boast that he will be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.” At this rate he will not even come up to the gains made during Obama’s final term. The average monthly gain under Trump so far is 191,000 — compared with an average monthly gain of 217,000 during the four years before he took office.

Unemployment — The unemployment rate, which was well below the historical norm when Trump took office, has continued to fall to the lowest rate in half a century.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the rate was 4.7% when he was sworn in. The most recent rate, for December, was 3.5%. It was also at that level in September and November. Before then it had not been so low since December 1969 — 50 years ago — when it was also 3.5%.

The jobless rate has been at or below 4% for the most recent 22 months — all under Trump. It hasn’t been that low for that long since a 50-month streak ending in January 1970.

The historical norm is 5.6%, which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948.

Job Openings — One reason employment growth has slowed is a shortage of qualified workers.

As of the last day of November, the most recent figure on record, the number of unfilled job openings stood at 6.8 million. That’s a gain of nearly 1.2 million unfilled job openings — or 20.9% — since Trump took office.

The number has been as high as 7.6 million as recently as January 2019, and also in November 2018, which was the highest in the 19 years the BLS has tracked this figure.

The number of unfilled jobs has exceeded the number of unemployed people looking for work every month since March 2018. In November, there were 989,000 more job openings than there were people seeking jobs.

Labor Force Participation — Despite the abundance of jobs, the labor force participation rate — which went down 2.9 percentage points during the Obama years — is up a bit under Trump.

The labor force participation rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks. Republicans often criticized Obama for the decline during his time, even though it was due mostly to the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age, and other demographic factors beyond the control of any president.

Since Trump took office, the rate has fluctuated in a narrow range between 63.2% and 62.8%. It was at its highest in December — 0.4 percentage points above where it was the month Trump took office.

Manufacturing Jobs —Manufacturing jobs increased under Trump, but the early growth slowed to a crawl last year.

Overall, the number is up by 487,000 under Trump. That followed a net decrease of 193,000 under Obama.

But the gain in factory jobs came almost entirely in 2017 and 2018, when 458,000 manufacturing jobs were added — a gain of 3.7%, faster growth than the 3.4% for total employment.

Last year Trump’s trade disputes and tariffs took a toll on the manufacturing sector. During 2019, factory jobs increased by only 46,000, a gain of 0.4%, compared with 1.4% for overall employment.

The number of manufacturing jobs is still 891,000 below where it was in December 2007, at the start of the Great Recession.

Economic Growth

The economy grew somewhat faster under Trump — but not at the rate he promised. Real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product was growing at an annual rate of 2.1% during the third quarter of 2019, after going up 2.9% in 2018 and 2.4% during his first year in office.

Initial estimates of fourth-quarter GDP and full-year 2019 GDP are due out Jan. 30, but there’s little reason to think growth picked up much, if at all. The “GDPNow” forecast produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projects that the fourth-quarter growth rate will come in at 1.8% based on several economic indicators that are already known.

Growth under Trump has averaged far less than the 4% to 6% per year that he promised repeatedly, both when he was a candidate and also as president. And most economists believe growth will remain far below what Trump promised:

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s most recent economic outlook, issued Aug. 21 , projects year-to-year growth of real GDP will grow only 1.9% in 2020.

issued Aug. 21 projects year-to-year growth A more recent median forecast of the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, issued Dec. 11, projects 2.0% growth in 2020 (measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, rather than from year to year).

issued The GDP forecasts offered by business and university economists to the Wall Street Journal’s monthly economic survey in December are a little less optimistic. Their average prediction was for only 1.9% growth this year.

Wall Street Journal’s monthly economic survey The National Association for Business Economics’ December survey produced a median forecast of 1.8% in 2020.

Income and Poverty

Household Income — Household income rose briskly under Trump.

The Census Bureau’s measure of median household income reached $63,179 in 2018, an increase of $1,400 from 2016 after adjusting for inflation.

In percentage terms, the increase during Trump’s first two years is 2.3%. (The median figure represents the midpoint — half of all households earned more, half less.)

The official figure is the highest ever recorded, exceeding previous records set in 2016 and 2017. But Census officials said those recent “records” are all due in part to a change in the survey questions in 2014. Starting then, the annual survey has picked up some sources of income that were previously missed.

Adjusting for that factor, and also for a change in the way Census processed data starting last year, Census officials published “estimated adjusted” figures showing what median household income would have been for past years, had the current questionnaire and processing procedures been in place. On that basis, the latest figure is just a few dollars less than it was in 1999 — $63,231.

The “estimated adjusted” figures also show an even greater increase during Trump’s first two years than the official figures, because the new data processing procedures had the effect of holding down income by a fraction of a percentage point. On an adjusted basis, the increase under Trump would be $1,638, or 2.7%.

Poverty — As incomes rose, the rate of poverty declined. The percentage of Americans living with income below the official poverty line went down to 11.8% of the population in 2018, the lowest level since 2001.

The poverty rate has now declined for four consecutive years, dropping by 1.3 percentage points in 2015, by 0.8 points in 2016 and by 0.4 points and 0.5 points in Trump’s first two years.

Regulations

The growth of federal regulation has stopped under Trump.

It wasn’t exactly the “sudden, screeching and beautiful halt” Trump prematurely claimed back in December 2017, when in fact the number of federal restrictions was still growing. But over the next several months the rise decelerated, and then reversed. The number of restrictions has now dropped to just below where it was when Trump was sworn in.

The number of restrictive words and phrases (such as “shall,” “prohibited” or “may not”) contained in the Code of Federal Regulations went up by 0.73% within Trump’s first 15 months, reaching a peak of nearly 1.09 million on April 6, 2018, according to daily tracking done by the QuantGov project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.

But as of Jan. 17, the number had dropped back below 1.08 million — 727 fewer than on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Trump took office.

In percentage terms, the drop is only 0.07% — not even one-tenth of 1 percentage point. But that’s a big change from the past. Restrictions grew at an average of 1.5% per year during both the Obama years and the George W. Bush years, according to annual QuantGov tracking.

The Mercatus count of restrictions doesn’t attempt to assess the cost or benefit of any particular rule — such assessments require a degree of guesswork and are sensitive to assumptions. But it does track the sheer volume of federal rules with more precision than we have found in other metrics.

Some of the recent changes are just clearing deadwood. Last March, for example, the Internal Revenue Service removed 296 regulations that it said “are no longer necessary because they do not have any current or future applicability.” And last year the Treasury Department scrapped an entire chapter of zombie-like regulations issued by the old Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversaw the savings-and-loan industry before being abolished in 2011. S&Ls have since fallen under other federal banking regulators, but the obsolete OTS rules remained on the books.

However, many of the rules Trump has eliminated are quite significant.

Within a month of taking office, for example, Trump signed a law nullifying an Obama-era rule restricting coal mining companies from dumping waste into streams and waterways. In 2018 his administration proposed withdrawing Obama’s edict requiring automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of new cars and light trucks to 46.8 miles per gallon by the year 2025. Instead, the requirement would be capped at the 2020 level of 37 mpg. And last September the EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy rule took effect, repealing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan rule. The Obama-era rule was designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by shifting away from coal as an energy source and would have required states to meet specific emissions reductions.

Crime

Crime declined during Trump’s first two years, except for rape, which increased.

The FBI’s annual Crime in the United States report, released Sept. 30, shows 1,199 fewer murders were committed in 2018 than in 2016, when Trump was elected. That’s a decline of 6.9%.

But despite that decline, the murder rate per 100,000 people, which was 5.0 last year, still was above the record low set in 2014, when it was 4.4.

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly claimed that the murder rate was “the highest it’s been in 45 years.” That was far from true. The rate did rise during President Obama’s final two years, to 5.4 per 100,000 in 2016. But the highest rate in the past half century was 10.2 in 1980.

Overall, the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 people went down 4.6% during Trump’s first two years. That included a 16.2% drop in the robbery rate, and a 0.6% decline in the rate of aggravated assault.

However, the number of reported rapes per 100,000 people went up — by 4.2%. (A rise in rapes and sexual assault in 2018 was also noted in the National Crime Victimization Survey, released Sept. 10, which covers crimes that are not reported to police, as well as those that are.)

The number of property crimes per 100,000 people went down 10.3% during Trump’s first two years, including a 19.8% drop in the burglary rate, an 8.6% drop in the rate of larcenies (such as shoplifting), and a 3.5% decline in the rate of motor vehicle thefts.

Guns

Sales and production of guns pulled back under Trump, after surging to record levels during the Obama years.

Handgun Production — In 2018, annual production of pistols and revolvers in the U.S. totaled just under 4.3 million, according to preliminary figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released July 22.

That represented a decline of 23% from 2016, when production surged to a record level of nearly 5.6 million.

Handgun production more than tripled during the Obama years. So the 2018 level was still 135% higher than it had been in 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency.

Gun Sales — Gun sales also dropped, but not by much.

The government doesn’t collect figures on sales of guns. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the gun industry’s trade group — tracks approximate sales figures by adjusting FBI statistics on background checks to remove those not related to actual sales, such as checks required for concealed-carry permits.

Those NSSF-adjusted figures dropped from a record 15.7 million in Obama’s final year to 13.2 million in 2019 — a decrease of 15.9%. But that was still 46.8% above where sales had been in 2008, the last year before Obama took office.

These figures cover rifles and shotguns and previously owned weapons, as well as new handguns. They are only an approximation of actual sales, since some of these checks cover purchases of multiple weapons, and of course some sales still occur without background checks.

Coal and Environment

Coal Mining Jobs — As a candidate, Trump promised to “put our [coal] miners back to work,” but so far not many have regained their jobs.

As of December, only 1,200 coal mining jobs had come back since Trump took office, according to BLS figures. That’s 3% of the 35,600 coal mining jobs that disappeared during the Obama years.

U.S. coal production last year was on track to be the lowest in 41 years. During the 12 months ending in November (the most recent for which figures are available), the Energy Information Administration estimated that 715 million short tons were produced, which is 1.8% below the figure for 2016. The last time annual production was this low was 1978.

The outlook for coal miners remains bleak. This month EIA predicted that coal production would fall 14% more in 2020. EIA expects natural gas will continue to displace coal for the generation of electricity.

Carbon Emissions —Carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption rose under Trump — but the rise seems to be a temporary blip in a long downward trend that started years before he took office.

Figures from EIA show CO2 emissions were 0.5% higher in the most recent 12 months on record (ending in September) than they were in 2016.

In the decade before Trump took office, emissions fell by a total of 14.5%, due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal-fired plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, as well as solar and wind power. Under Trump, the trend reversed with a 2.9% increase in 2018.

But that year was an anomaly. A hotter than normal summer and colder than normal winter resulted in higher natural gas consumption. EIA is currently estimating that CO2 emissions fell 2.1% in 2019, and will continue going down this year and next.

Border Security

Illegal border crossings surged to the highest in a dozen years. The total for last year was 799,669, the highest annual total since 2007 and 81% higher than in 2016, the year before Trump took office.

Migration is seasonal. Attempted border crossings tend to be highest in March, April and May and lowest in December.

In May, 132,856 people were apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without permission, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That was the highest total since March 2006, when the monthly total hit nearly 161,000.

Following the usual pattern, apprehensions fell in each of the last six months of 2019, to 32,858 in December. But that figure was still above the average for a December in the Obama years, which was 27,688.

Last year’s surge was different from those of earlier years, when most attempted border crossings were made by Mexican males seeking work. But in the peak month of May last year, over 72% of those apprehended were either unaccompanied children or part of “family units” made up of a child under 18 accompanied by a parent or guardian. Border Patrol officials said they are coming primarily from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and many are seeking asylum.

Corporate Profits

After-tax corporate profits remained near record levels under Trump. During 2018, they hit $1.84 trillion for the year (see line 45), just under the record $1.86 trillion recorded for 2014. During the third quarter of 2019, profits still were running at a yearly rate of nearly $1.84 trillion, very close to the full-year figure for 2018.

The most recent quarter’s annual rate is 5.6% higher than the full-year figure for 2016, the year before Trump’s inauguration.

Stock Market

Stock prices continued their decade-long rise with Trump in office, setting new records last year and then again in the new year.

At the close on Jan. 17, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average was 47.1% higher than it was on the last trading day before Trump’s inauguration.

Other indexes took similar rides. At the Jan. 17 close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 48.7% under Trump. And the NASDAQ composite index, made up of more than 3,000 companies, closed on Jan. 17 at 69.5% higher than before Trump took office.

The bull market began its rise in the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, and became the longest in history in 2018, passing its 10th anniversary in March of last year.

Wages and Inflation

The upward trend in real wages continued under Trump, and inflation remained in check.

CPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 6% during Trump’s first 35 months, continuing a long period of historically low inflation.

In the most recent 12 months, ending in December, the CPI rose 2.3%. The CPI rose an average of 1.8% each year of the Obama presidency (measured as the 12-month change ending each January), and an average of 2.4% during each of George W. Bush’s years.

Wages — Paychecks continued to grow faster than prices.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 2.5% during Trump’s first 35 months (ending in December).

Those figures include managers and supervisors. Rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers (82% of all workers) are doing just a bit better than their bosses. Real earnings for them have gone up 2.6% so far under Trump.

Those gains extend a long trend. Real wages took a dive during the Great Recession of 2007-2009, but have been rising now since hitting a low point in July 2008. During the Obama years, real weekly earnings rose 4% for all workers, and 4.2% for rank-and-file.

Consumer Sentiment

Consumer confidence in the economy rose under Trump.

The University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers monthly index first soared to a peak of 101.4 in March 2018, which was the highest in 14 years. Since then confidence sagged a bit, and has fluctuated. The preliminary figure for January, released Jan. 17, was 99.1. That is 11.9 points above where it was in October 2016, just before Trump was elected after promising to boost economic growth.

Home Prices and Ownership

Home Prices — Home prices soared to record levels under Trump.

The national median price of an existing, single-family home set a record high of $288,500 in June 2019, according to sales figures from the National Association of Realtors.

Prices have moderated a bit since then, but still stood at $274,000 in November, the most recent monthly figure available. That is $45,300 higher than the median price of $228,700 for homes sold during the month Trump took office — a gain in value of 19.8%. The rise in the Consumer Price Index during the same period was 5.8%.

The Realtors’ figures reflect raw sales prices without attempting to adjust for such factors as variations in the size, location, age or condition of the homes sold in a given month or year. Even so, a similar pattern emerges from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which compares sales prices of similar homes and seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing single-family housing stock.

The Case-Shiller index for October sales (the most recent available) was at a record high — and 15% above where it stood in the month Trump took office.

Whichever way you measure it, homeowners have seen the value of their houses rise substantially since Trump became president.

Homeownership — The percentage of Americans who own their homes has continued to recover under Trump.

Back in 2004 the homeownership rate hit a record 69.2% of households for two quarters, but then began a years-long slide, hitting bottom in the second quarter of 2016 at 62.9%. That was the lowest point in more than half a century, and tied for the lowest on record.

The rate recovered 0.8 points in the six months before Trump took office, and went up another 1.1 points under Trump, reaching 64.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018, and again in the third quarter of 2019, the most recent Census Bureau figures available.

But that’s still 4.4 points below the peak level of 15 years earlier.

Trade

The trade deficit that Trump promised to reduce grew much larger during his first two years, but may have stabilized in his third.

The most recent government figures show that the total U.S. trade deficit in goods and services during the most recent 12 months on record (ending in November) was nearly $624 billion. That’s an increase of $121 billion, or 24%, compared with 2016.

However, all that increase took place during 2017 and 2018, when the deficit surged nearly 25%. It may have declined a bit in 2019. December’s figures haven’t yet been released, but in the first 11 months of last year the deficit was 0.7% below the same period in 2018.

China — The goods-and-services trade deficit with China is 10.6% higher under Trump, a much smaller increase than in the U.S. trade gap overall.

Trump began a full-scale trade conflict with China in early 2018. At first the trade gap with China continued to go up, but that turned around in 2019; in each of the first three quarters the deficit with China got progressively smaller.

However, the smaller deficit comes at a price — a throttling of trade in which both sides suffer. U.S. exports to China in the most recent quarter were 5% below the same quarter a year earlier. And the pain was three times worse in China. Their exports to the U.S. went down 15% in the same period.

The trade war continues. Trump signed a “phase one” trade deal with China Jan. 15, under which the U.S. held off on new tariffs while China promised to buy more U.S. agricultural goods. But the big issues aren’t settled. China has yet to agree to reduce subsidies to exporting businesses or to limit its demands that U.S. businesses share their intellectual property.

Mexico — Meanwhile the much smaller trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico has grown much faster than the global trade gap. It totaled $97 billion during the 12 months ending in November, an increase of 57% compared with 2016.

Canada — The trade surplus that the U.S. runs with Canada has dwindled to nearly nothing under Trump. The trade balance was positive by only $406 million during the 12 months ending in November. That surplus has shrunk by 95% since 2016.

On Jan. 16 the Senate voted final approval of a new trade agreement Trump signed over a year earlier with the leaders of Canada and Mexico. The pact was revised to satisfy demands by Democrats for stronger enforcement of labor standards and environmental protections, clearing the way for House approval on Dec. 19. It is expected to take effect in the near future, and will replace the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump had promised to scrap during his campaign. The new agreement will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.

Health Insurance Coverage

The number of people lacking health insurance rose by nearly 2 million under Trump.

The U.S. Census Bureau reported Sept. 10 that the number of Americans who lacked health insurance for all of 2018 was 27.5 million — up from 25.6 million in 2017. That’s an increase of 1.9 million.

It was the first time in a decade that this number increased. The percentage of Americans without coverage for the entire year rose to 8.5%, from 7.9% the year before.

(A technical note: Normally we would compare the most recent figures with those from 2016, before Trump took office. But last year Census used a new “improved” method to estimate the uninsured population in 2017 and 2018, and said these figures shouldn’t be compared with estimates produced in earlier years.)

The Census report confirmed a trend we’ve been tracking using a somewhat different measure released on a more frequent and timely basis by the National Health Interview Survey. The NHIS put the number of people who lacked coverage at the time they were interviewed — not necessarily for the entire year — at 30.4 million in 2018, an increase of 1.8 million over 2016.

The NHIS said 9.4% of the population lacked coverage at the time of interview in 2018, up from 9% in 2016.

A much greater rise was reported by a Gallup survey covering the final quarter of 2018. Gallup on Jan. 23, 2019, put the rise in uninsured adults at about 7 million, compared with the last half of 2016. Gallup put the percentage of uninsured adults at 13.7% in the October-December quarter. For details, see our Feb. 12 story, “Did the Uninsured Increase by 7 Million?“

Trump failed to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act as he promised to do, but did slash advertising and outreach aimed at enrolling people in Obamacare plans. In December 2017 he signed a tax bill that ended the ACA’s tax penalty for people who fail to obtain coverage, effective last year. And in March 2019 the Trump administration joined an effort by GOP state attorneys general seeking a court decision to overturn the entire act. But on Dec. 18, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 that only the provision requiring individuals to buy health insurance should be struck down because the penalty had been repealed — and it sent the case back to a district court judge to reconsider whether other parts of the law ought to fall.

Food Stamps

The number of food stamp recipients dropped to the lowest levels in a decade.

Early last year the number dropped below 37 million for the first time since October 2009, when millions were signing up for benefits in the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

As of October last year, the most recent month for which figures are available, 36.4 million people were receiving the aid.

The number of food stamp recipients has gone down 6.3 million, or 14.8%, since January 2017, when Trump took office.

The number of recipients is now 11.4 million below the peak month of December 2012. But it is still 9 million above where it was at the start of the Great Recession, in December 2007, despite years of an improving economy.

The administration is working to reduce the number further. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalized a rule that will tighten work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, effective April 1. That will cause 688,000 fewer people to be eligible for benefits in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, according to the department’s regulatory analysis.

And last July, the Trump administration proposed another rule that it said could remove another 3 million people from the rolls. That rule would take away flexibility that many states now use to grant food aid to people with income or assets exceeding federal limits.

Judiciary Appointments

Trump is putting his mark on the federal appeals courts more quickly than Obama was able to do in his time in office.

Supreme Court — So far Trump has won Senate confirmation for two Supreme Court nominees, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

Obama also was able to fill two high court vacancies during his first two years in office, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan. But the Kavanaugh nomination to fill the vacancy created by Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement is significant because Kavanaugh may move the court to the right. He is considered to be more conservative than Kennedy, who sometimes sided with the liberal justices to provide deciding votes on issues including gay rights, abortion, capital punishment and affirmative action.

However, Kavanaugh disappointed abortion foes when he sided with the court’s liberals on one of his first votes, against taking up a case about whether citizens should be allowed to sue states that cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood health clinics.

Court of Appeals — Trump also won confirmation of 50 U.S. Court of Appeals judges (30 during his first two years and another 20 in 2019). That’s double the total for Obama, who won confirmation for 25 as of the same point in his first term (16 during his first two years and nine more in 2011).

Trump has now installed nearly 28% of all the 179 appellate court judges authorized by federal law.

District Court — Trump also outpaced Obama on filling lower courts. Trump has won confirmation for 133 of his nominees to be federal District Court judges as of the end of 2019. That’s nearly 20% of the 677 authorized district judges. Obama had won confirmation for 99 at the same point in his presidency.

Trump has also filled five seats on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which has nationwide jurisdiction over lawsuits seeking money from the government. And he has filled two seats on the U.S. Court for International Trade. Obama filled none to either court during his first term.

Trump must share responsibility for this record with the Republican majority in the Senate. Republicans not only refused to consider Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy eventually filled by Gorsuch, but they also blocked confirmation of dozens of Obama’s nominees to lower courts. Trump inherited 17 Court of Appeals vacancies, for example, including seven that had Obama nominees pending but never confirmed.

Federal Debt and Deficits

The federal debt went up more than $2 trillion under Trump, as trillion-dollar annual federal deficits returned. And there’s no end in sight.

The federal debt held by the public stood at $17.2 trillion at the last count on Jan. 16 — an increase of nearly $2.8 trillion since he took office. That’s a 19.3% increase under Trump. And that figure will go up even more quickly in coming years unless Trump and Congress impose massive spending cuts, or reverse course and increase taxes.

Trump’s cuts in corporate and individual income tax rates — as well as bipartisan spending deals he signed in 2018 and 2019 — are causing the red ink to gush even faster than it did before.

The federal government’s annual deficit hit $984 billion in fiscal year 2019, which ended Sept. 30 last year.

CBO’s most recent update of its Budget and Economic Outlook, issued Aug. 21, projected that under then-current law annual deficits would top $1 trillion in the current fiscal year and average $1.2 trillion each year from 2020 through 2029. But then just five days before Christmas, Trump signed another $1.7 trillion bipartisan spending deal that the head of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called “fiscally reckless.”

CBO is still digesting that and other factors, and is due to issue a new projection sometime this month.

The debt is now equal to about 78% of the nation’s entire gross domestic product. CBO said Oct. 3 that if current laws aren’t changed, the debt “would approach 100 percent of GDP by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.” That would be far higher than the debt the U.S. ran up during World War II, which was the highest in the nation’s history."

The president attempted to take a victory lap after a better-than-expected jobs report showed the national unemployment rate falling to 13.3% last month, with 2.5m jobs gained. But there was a slight uptick in African American joblessness.

In White House remarks that folded digressions within digressions, Trump declared: “Today is probably, if you think of it, the greatest comeback in American history.”

Speaking after the 10th night of mass anti-racism protests across the country, Trump suggested that Floyd, who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, would be happy about the figures.

“Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this a great thing that’s happening for our country,” he said. “There’s a great day for him. It’s a great day for everybody. It’s a great day for everybody. There’s a great, great day in terms of equality.”

The comment earned swift opprobrium. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said: “George Floyd’s last words, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,’ have echoed all across this nation and, quite frankly, around the world. For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd I frankly think is despicable.”

Michael Steele, who is African American, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the MSNBC network: “It’s not only tone deaf, it’s borderline blasphemous in light of what happened to Mr Floyd.

“I doubt George Floyd is in heaven looking down going, ‘Oh gee, great jobs report!’ Are you kidding me? Again, it speaks to just how out of step this man is with real life. This reality television presidency is incompatible with democracy, it’s incompatible with governing, it’s incompatible with everyday people trying to realise the American dream.”

Defenders of Trump argued that he was being willfully misconstrued. America First Action, a pro-Trump Super Political Action Committee, claimed in a tweet that his remark was taken “out of context”. Moments before referencing Floyd, Trump had said: “Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed.”

The official White House Twitter account highlighted that comment in an apparent damage limitation exercise. But Democrats and other critics were unconvinced, noting that Trump had specifically tied Floyd’s imagined happiness to Friday, the day of the jobs report.

Brandon Gassaway, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said: “Trump’s claim is revolting, enraging, disrespectful – a slap in the face and a descent to the lowest possible level of discourse. Trump has no concern or regard for the feelings of anyone and will take every opportunity, even trampling on the memory of George Floyd, to commemorate a jobs report that shows fewer than half of black adults currently have a job and that fully 21 million Americans are unemployed.”

5:16 What the George Floyd protests say about America – video explainer

The surprise increase in jobs came after economists had predicted a rise in unemployment to 20% as America reels from the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdowns. But the new rate of 13.3% is still far higher than previous peak unemployment, which was 10.8% in 1982.

Most of the 2.5m jobs gained over the month were in hospitality and leisure, an industry that lost 7.5m jobs in April as states went into quarantine. Analysts Capital Economics wrote that the report generated mixed feelings of “optimism, skepticism and anguish”.

They expect the economy to recoup about 60% of lost jobs by year-end with the unemployment rate dropping to 8-10%.

The president has been fiercely condemned for mishandling the pandemic and showing little empathy for minorities who suffered the worst of its health and economic effects, then for responding to nationwide protests by ordering law enforcement to “dominate” the streets and even threatening to deploy the military.

But Trump will hope the May report boosts his chance in November’s election against former vice-president Biden. In April, Jason Furman, a former economist in the Barack Obama administration, predicted: “We are about to see the best economic data we’ve seen in the history of this country” – a suggestion that reportedly alarmed Democratic strategists.

Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Trump struck a triumphal note, likening the economy to a healthy patient making a quick recovery. “This is outstanding, what’s happened today,” he said. “Now, they thought the number would be a loss of 9m jobs and it was a gain of almost 3m jobs.

“The numbers are great, and this leads us on to a long period of growth. We’ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nothing close. And I think we’re going to have a very good upcoming few months.”

Some commentators have expressed hope that, having been put into an induced coma, the economy could make a “V-shaped” recovery. Trump again brushed aside warnings from public health experts and urged state governors to push ahead with economic reopenings.

“Now we’re opening, and we’re opening with a bang,” he said. “We’ve been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship.”

Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent of PBS News, asked Trump if he has a plan to address systemic racism. He replied: “It’s the greatest thing that can happen for race relations, for the African-American community, for the Asian American, for the Hispanic-American community, for women, for everything.

“Because our country is so strong, and that’s what my plan is. We’re going to have the strongest economy in the world. We almost are there now … And now we’re going to have an economy that’s even stronger.”

Although the unemployment rate for white people decreased from 14.2% to 12.4%, the rate for African Americans went up from 16.7% to 16.8%. When Alcindor challenged Trump on this point, he dismissed her with a wave and said: “You are something.”

Democrats dismissed Trump’s bombast and said he was out of touch with the pain and anguish felt by millions, particularly African Americans.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said: “With nearly 20m people out of work and unemployment among African Americans increasing, now is not the time to be complacent or take a victory lap. Thirteen per cent unemployment number is not ‘joyous’ or ‘stupendous’ as President Trump has wrongly stated.”

Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Obama, tweeted: “Depression-era unemployment, 100,000+ dead, millions sick, massive protests, police riots, and Trump is giving a celebratory press conference. Not sure I’ve ever heard a president sound so divorced from the reality that most Americans are facing. Hilariously out of touch.”"

....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019

The U.S. military began withdrawing troops from northern Syria on Monday, paving the way for what the White House on Sunday referred to as a ""long-planned"" Turkish operation in the area. The Pentagon issued a statement later on Monday clarifying they would not support or endorse such an operation.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned the president's plan, calling it a betrayal that would leave Kurdish forces who've taken the lead in fighting ISIS terrorists for the United States at the mercy of the Turkish military. Turkey has long considered Kurdish fighters in Syria as a threat and experts on Monday told NBC News that the U.S. withdrawal could destabilize the region.

Trump, who spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by phone prior to Sunday's announcement, did not say what actions he would consider to be ""off limits.""

At a White House event later Monday, Trump was asked why he was siding with Turkey and its authoritarian president over allies who have been fighting the Islamic State for years. He said, ""I'm not siding with anyone.""

He also said he told Erdogan if any of ""our people"" got hurt there would be ""big trouble."" He said that the U.S. would ""try"" to protect the Kurds against the Turkish military.

""The Kurds are natural enemies [with Turkey], they’ve been fighting for hundreds of years. We interject ourselves into wars, and tribal wars, and revolution, they’re not the kind of things you settle the way you want to settle,"" he said. ""China and Russia love that we are bogged down.

Trump also brushed off a suggestion that U.S. military officials were blindsided by the move.

""I consulted with everybody,"" he said. ""I always consult with everybody.""

In an earlier tweet, he argued: ""The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST!""

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle spoke out against Trump's decision.

“Once again, President Trump is deserting an ally in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in reference to Erdogan. ""By turning operational responsibility over to the Turks, President Trump has abandoned our Kurdish partners. This decision poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.

Sen. Pat Toomey, R.-Penn., said in a statement that the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from the northern Syrian border poses ""a significant threat to our national security and risks reversing the progress made in the region to destroy ISIS.""

""It could also lead to war between Turkey and Syrian Kurds, a result that will boost enemy regimes in Syria, Iran, and Russia,"" Toomey said. ""This betrayal of the Kurds will also severely harm our credibility as an ally the world over.”

Trump shrugged off the criticisms while speaking to reporters at the White House. ""They have their opinion, and a lot of people do,"" he said, but others ""are extremely thrilled."" ""Many people agree with it very strongly,"" Trump said."

Even if the mini trade deal made between the U.S. and China on Friday provides some relief to farmers who export to China, the tariffs that are already in place and the threat of a renewed escalation present enormous costs to Americans.

Economists from academia and the policy sphere have used a variety of methods to estimate the impact of new tariffs implemented in 2018 and 2019 on U.S. firms and households. Variation across emerging estimates reflects more than measurement issues. The costs imposed by tariffs go beyond the direct dollar-price increases resulting from these new taxes on targeted goods. There are efficiency costs and uncertainty about their future path.

Tariffs also may benefit protected sectors of the economy and are a source of government revenue. The evolving range of estimates depends on which costs and benefits are taken into account. Estimates of the average gross annual cost of tariffs levied in 2018 through the first half of 2019 tend toward $800 per household. Estimates of net costs vary more widely. When setting aside policy uncertainty, they vary from about $60 to $500.

(Click here for a larger version of the table with a complete listing of studies mentioned, their estimates, and the different factors each study takes into account.)

The latest studies suggest the combination of new tariffs and increased trade policy uncertainty create a substantial drag on the economy as a whole: net losses projected for 2020 are between about $500 and $1700 per household.

Costs imposed by tariffs go beyond direct dollar-price increases on targeted goods. Evolving estimates range in value depending on what they take into account.

The facts

A tariff is a tax imposed on goods that the U.S. buys from other countries. An important part of the cost of the tariffs for U.S. households and firms consists of the tax incidence — the portion of the tax that is passed on to various buyers and sellers of targeted goods once they arrive at the U.S. border. One study finds that the group of tariffs levied only during the year 2018 would raise the cost of the consumption bundle for the average household by $135 dollars (see this table for a summary of all studies mentioned, their estimates, and the different factors each study takes into account). An update by the same authors estimates the costs of tariffs imposed in 2018 and through June 2019 will cost the average U.S. household $247 per year, or $460 per household per year when including those planned through December 2019.

Beyond adding up how much U.S. buyers expend on tariffs, or which buyers bear the greatest incidence, an accounting of the full costs of the tariffs should include the fact that the taxes also generate efficiency losses. Households and firms may have to substitute away from goods targeted by the tariff toward alternatives that cost more than they were paying before, or that are less well suited to their needs or preferences. Some buyers at the margin may find that they are no longer able to afford as much of the good, or may decide to go without it. These broader costs, called “deadweight loss,” may be between half and 3 times the direct burden of the tariff (see here for a concise breakdown of tariff payments versus deadweight loss). Two studies find that the cost of tariffs levied only during the year 2018, including both the direct cost and the deadweight loss from the tariff, totals $400 to $500 (see Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2019) and Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2019) in the table). Two studies estimate that the cost of tariffs levied in 2018 and the first half of 2019, including both the direct burden and the deadweight loss, amounts to roughly $800 per household (see here and here, also in the table).

Tariffs can result in diffuse price increases that are difficult for researchers to measure with precision in real-time. Academic research suggests — and companies have announced — that firms whose costs are affected by tariffs may spread theses costs across goods that were not targeted by the tariff. The objective may be to minimize the number of goods exhibiting a large retail price hike, which can disrupt sales volumes. However, this type of strategic pricing also may enable stores to pass on a higher fraction of the costs. Domestic producers in U.S. industries protected by tariffs (as well as foreign producers not subject to the tariffs applied to Chinese goods) may also raise prices on their goods in the U.S. market, adding another layer of complexity in measuring the overall impact on prices for consumers. Production of some goods may be flexible enough that a tariff on varieties from only one country will have no effect at all. Economists are still studying exactly how much the changes in the prices of targeted goods as they cross the border translate into prices charged to the final purchasers as opposed to being absorbed by firms and distributors as losses on the supply-side

The trade policy uncertainty can affect the investment and hiring decisions of firms, slowing economic activity. Tariffs have been introduced rapidly; their ultimate size, scope and duration is as yet unknown; and the range of retaliatory tariffs is likewise evolving. All of these issues present uncertainty, introducing an additional risk in investing and hiring because firms may find it harder to anticipate the costs of imported inputs or the scope of their export market. This results in the economy growing less than it otherwise would. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that combined with the deadweight losses from tariffs, policy uncertainty will cause U.S. gross domestic product to be 0.3 percentage points lower in 2020 than it otherwise would be. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, using a more detailed measure of trade policy uncertainty, estimates that GDP will be a full percentage point lower in 2020 than it otherwise would be, driven by disruption in investment and industrial production. These two studies suggest these losses will amount to between $500 and $1,700 per household on average in 2020 alone.

Some studies account either explicitly or implicitly for increased profits and wages in industries protected by the new tariffs and for tariff revenues as a source of government revenue. While the imposition of tariffs may make the economy less well off in general, this does not mean that it is a loss for everyone: tariffs generate gains for some firms. For instance, protection from foreign competition allows some firms to raise their price — increasing their profits and the wages they are able to pay. Like other taxes, tariffs also are a source of government revenue. Taking this into account can affect estimates of the overall cost of tariffs: one study that includes these factors (but does not include the broader uncertainty) finds net effects from the 2018 tariffs as low as $61 per household per year, on average. The empirical approaches by the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors implicitly allow for some benefits to be factored in, but still find net losses from changes in trade policy (with uncertainty) through June 2019 of roughly $500 to $1700 per year in 2020, averaged across households.

Most studies assume substantial pass-through of the tariffs into the prices that households and firms pay for targeted goods. Studies of the first year and a half of the new tariffs suggest that the entire cost of the tariffs did, indeed, appear in the prices of goods targeted for tariffs as they crossed the border into the United States. The substantial pass-through of tariffs observed in prices of targeted goods as they cross the border may indicate, in line with previous research, that because a lot of U.S. trade with China is invoiced in dollars, prices of U.S. imports from China are sticky in dollars. Depreciation of the Chinese Renmimbi (RMB) against the U.S. dollar over time may offset some of the direct cost of the tariffs for importers. Adjustments in the prices in response to exchange rate fluctuations when prices exhibit stickiness can sometimes take 1-3 years, depending on expectations. Exchange rate adjustment is not a panacea. It does not eliminate all deadweight loss from the tariff because tariffs still distort the prices of goods targeted by the tax relative to goods not targeted. Exchange rate adjustment also does not eliminate the effects of the new policy uncertainty, which may be much larger than the more direct costs of the tariffs.

What this means

Economists across academic and policymaking institutions have produced a number of different estimates of the impact that changes in trade policy since the start of 2018 have had on the U.S. economy. The lowest estimates involve only the direct incidence of the new taxes on consumers.

The highest estimates include the direct costs of the tariffs, costs related to distortions the tariffs generate in firm and household behavior, and the drag on firm activity that increased uncertainty about trade policy has brought.

Taking the full range of estimates into account, the new trade policy regime implemented in 2018 through June 2019 is likely to result in an average cost per U.S. household between $500 and $1,700 a year."

The private forecast, one of several delivered to Trump and described by three people familiar with the briefing, contrasts sharply with the triumphant rhetoric the president and his surrogates have repeatedly used to describe the economy.

Even as his aides warn of a business climate at risk of faltering, the president has been portraying the economy to the public as “phenomenal” and “incredible.” He has told aides that he thinks he can convince Americans that the economy is vibrant and unrattled through a public messaging campaign. But the internal and external warnings that the economy could slip have contributed to a muddled and often contradictory message.

Administration officials have scrambled this week to assemble a menu of actions Trump could take to avert an economic downturn. Few aides have a firm sense of what steps he would seriously consider, in part because he keeps changing his mind.

Ideas that have been discussed include imposing a currency transaction tax that could weaken the dollar and make U.S. exports more competitive; creating a rotation among the Federal Reserve governors that would make it easier to check the power of Chair Jerome H. Powell, whom Trump has blamed for not doing all he can to increase growth; and pushing to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent in an effort to spur more investment. Some, if not all, of these steps would require congressional approval.

[Trump says the economy is now the ‘greatest.’ Here’s how it compares to Obama’s.]

“Everyone is nervous — everyone,” said a Republican with close ties to the White House and congressional GOP leaders. “It’s not a panic, but they are nervous.”

This article is based on interviews with more than 25 current and former administration officials, lawmakers, and external advisers who have been in contact with Trump and his team throughout August. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity because the White House has been requesting that allies and aides keep its economic message intact.

Compounding Trump’s situation, some of the economy’s strains appear to be of his own making, as uncertainty surrounding his trade war with China has frozen much investment nationwide.

“The China trade war is causing most of this,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is close to Trump. “It’s just the world economy is affected when China has a problem.”

Trump has publicly gloated about economic problems in China and Europe — even declaring last Sunday that “the world is in a recession right now” — but those strains appear to be holding back U.S. growth as well.

The economic message emanating from the White House is a product of tensions and debates about how to handle that bracing reality — and Trump’s own stubbornness on trade strategy and his anger about news coverage of the economy.

That has led to a month of tense economic policymaking and markets. On Aug. 1, Trump announced new tariffs against Chinese imports. On Aug. 13, he delayed most of them, worried about the impact on the U.S. economy. On Aug. 20, he said he was considering new tax cuts. The next day, he said he had changed his mind.

Amid it all, stocks proved highly volatile and the U.S. and global bond markets rang numerous alarm bells, a far cry from the era of synchronized global growth that had marked Trump’s first two years in office. Other economic soft spots also have emerged, particularly in U.S. manufacturing, a sector Trump had promised to revive.

Although Trump sold himself to voters in 2016 as a master businessman who knew just what to do to rev up the economy, his stewardship could now have major implications for his reelection chances, especially if the more pessimistic forecasts prove prescient.

But beyond the political impact, Trump’s handling of the economic slowdown has opened up the White House to scathing criticism from members of past economic teams, who have contended that the flailing process and lack of traditionally credentialed economists at the helm could exacerbate a downturn.

[American consumers are holding up the global economy. But for how long?]

“The irony here is that Trump’s erratic, chaotic approach to the economy is probably the most significant economic risk factor in the world right now,” said Gene Sperling, who served in top economic roles during the Clinton and Obama administrations. “Their response is just to show even more erratic behavior. It’s economic narcissism. It’s economic policy by whim, pride, ego and tantrum.”

White House spokesman Judd Deere defended the administration’s approach and said officials remain very optimistic about the economy’s performance.

“The White House does not think we are imminently headed for” a downturn, he said. “The fundamentals of the economy are strong because of this president’s pro-growth policies.”

Trump has lauded the economy as the best in U.S. history, while some of his Democratic rivals have said it is barreling toward a recession.

Neither of those descriptions is quite accurate, most economists say. Parts of the economy, particularly consumer spending and the labor market, remain robust. Retail sales are strong, and wages are rising. But business investment, the ballooning federal deficit and trade concerns are creating pressure that White House officials have struggled to explain away. And some of these problems are worsening.

“This administration has not done itself a whole lot of favors in talking about the economy,” said Tony Fratto, who served in senior roles during the George W. Bush administration at the White House and the Treasury Department. “They have done a lot of communicating that is verifiably false on the economy.”

Trump has a lean and increasingly combative economic team, whose members often are at odds with one another on trade and tax policy. Almost all are deferential to the president, but they habitually jostle to advance their causes with him, sometimes maneuvering behind one another’s backs.

White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have fought for months over Kudlow’s push to index capital gains taxes to inflation, for example, with Trump caught in the middle. The proposal would reduce taxes on investment income, primarily benefiting people with higher incomes, but most economists think that would do little to spur immediate economic growth.

White House economic team meetings are less structured than when Trump’s aides collectively pushed a giant corporate and individual income tax cut into law two years ago. Sometimes aides walk out unsure of what was agreed on. Sometimes nothing was agreed on.

But that format drew little scrutiny when advisers were used to primarily boast about the economy’s strength to the news media in the past year. Now, these aides have come under extreme pressure this month as Trump has gyrated in his economic approach and vented his frustration inside the West Wing.

Mnuchin has privately disagreed with key aspects of Trump’s approach to the economy, according to people familiar with the matter. But he has largely disappeared from public view during the turbulent month. Kevin Hassett, a former Council of Economic Advisers chairman and a frequent media commentator, has left the administration.

Stepping into their void is Kudlow, a Reagan administration official and longtime television commentator; senior trade adviser Peter Navarro, an academic with a long history of anti-China positions; and Trump himself, who often undercuts or contradicts his aides, only to reverse himself the next day.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have sensed the White House’s stress and said the goal is to beat back negative public opinion.

“It’s not economic data that’s driving the concern as much as headlines and the stock market having a big drop,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), a close Trump ally. “It becomes a headline, then it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy that is not based on any underlying economic fundamentals. There’s a real proactive effort by the White House to try and make sure the economy continues in a robust manner.”

The current economic drama began on the first day of this month, when over the objection of some senior advisers, Trump announced that he would impose tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. Just days earlier, the president had signaled that he was ready to back down from his fight with the Chinese, speculating that Beijing wanted to wait until after the 2020 election to negotiate a trade deal.

But a fruitless visit Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer made to Shanghai infuriated Trump, several people briefed on his reaction said, and he announced the tariffs in a Twitter post shortly after they returned. At the time, Navarro was the only aide who supported the move.

That announcement began a chaotic chain of economic and political events that White House aides have struggled to control ever since.

The following weekend, China’s currency weakened, a move that would make its exports more competitive, and Chinese officials signaled that they would not be increasing purchases of U.S. farm products, as Trump had demanded.

So on Monday, amid fears that the trade war would spiral out of control, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 767 points. Trump strongly urged Mnuchin to label China a currency manipulator, a symbolic yet harmless shaming that the secretary had resisted because the Treasury Department’s indicators didn’t show that China qualified for such a label. But under pressure, the treasury chief did so shortly after the stock market closed.

Meanwhile, U.S. business executives panicked about the scope of Trump’s new tariffs, and White House officials were bombarded with complaints. So Trump began drawing up plans to delay the tariffs on products such as laptop computers, shoes and clothing. This posed a problem, though.

Trump had insisted for more than a year, without evidence, that China was paying all of the tariffs. This was false, because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers and collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. For the first time in months, Trump’s economic message showed signs of cracking. He would soon admit that his economic approach could harm consumers.

On Aug. 13, Lighthizer’s office issued a news release with little fanfare announcing that tariffs on nearly $160 billion in Chinese imports had been delayed until Dec. 15. Trump would later tell reporters that the intent was to ensure that Americans didn’t pay higher costs during the holidays, one of the first times he had acknowledged that the tariffs raised costs.

“What we’ve done is we’ve delayed it so they won’t be relevant in the Christmas shopping season,” he said at the time.

The stock market rallied amid a sense that Trump was preparing to back down, but economic fears grew deeper the next day.

On Aug. 14, key parts of the U.S. bond market tipped over, creating an “inverted yield curve,” an unusual condition in which investors are rushing to buy ultrasafe long-term assets and that often precedes a recession. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 800 points.

In the middle of the day, Trump tried to spin the inversion as a positive thing, saying it was a reflection of how attractive U.S. debt was to consumers. But after the stock market closed, his Twitter feed took on a more furious tone.

He cited the “CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE” and blamed a “clueless” Powell from the Fed.

Through the week, White House officials became increasingly agitated that the public sentiment about the economy seemed to be tipping. Trump, aides said, is obsessed with media coverage of the economy, and thinks Americans will believe negative news and stop spending money. This exasperation began several months earlier.

“In the last couple of weeks, when the market dipped down, it did strike an amount of fear within the White House,” a White House official said. “There’s been a sense going into 2020 that we can bounce back from virtually everything if the economy stays strong.”

The day after the yield curve inverted, Kudlow said in an interview with The Washington Post that the economy was much stronger and more resilient than people were making it out to be.

“What I see is a pretty good second half coming up,” he said.

Trump, however, kept talking with advisers inside and outside the White House and was getting a mixed picture. Still, White House officials complained that news outlets were elevating negative economic news in a way that discounted the progress the White House had made.

Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said the media coverage of any economic downturn is “way overblown.”

“If it’s not Russia, it’s racism. If it’s not racism, it’s a recession,” she said.

Kudlow took a lead role in the White House’s pushback on Aug. 18, appearing on two television programs to try to quell fears of a recession.

“I don’t see a recession at all,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he urged Americans, “Let’s not be afraid of optimism.”

A few hours later, though, Trump stepped on that message. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey before returning to Washington, he said, “The world is in a recession right now,” attempting to draw a contrast with the United States, which is not.

By the time Kudlow and Trump made their comments, a freewheeling policy process had taken hold. Some White House officials had begun discussing whether to slash payroll tax rates, although a number of senior officials were never told this was under consideration. Americans pay 6.2 percent of their paychecks to fund Social Security, but in the past Congress has temporarily reduced this payment as a way to spur more spending and help the economy in a downturn.

When The Post reported that the idea was being discussed on Monday afternoon, the White House issued an anonymous statement saying the idea wasn’t “under consideration at this time.” The reason for trying to shoot down the news, two people briefed on the planning said, was a sense that the public would think the White House was panicking if it was revealed that it was contemplating what could be a $100 billion tax cut.

Bad economic news continued. On Monday night, news outlets reported that U.S. Steel could be temporarily laying off up to 200 workers at a Michigan facility. Trump had claimed that his trade policies had revived U.S. Steel around the country, but the company was confronted with lower steel prices and weaker demand than expected.

By Tuesday, Trump was under growing pressure to explain how he was preparing for a possible slowdown.

He said that he was considering a payroll tax cut, as well as the capital gains change for which Kudlow had long advocated. His comments stunned some aides but others shrugged them off, aware that it is nearly impossible to be up to speed on what Trump is thinking at any given moment, even on particular issues such as tax policy.

When Trump made the comments, his economic team was scattered. Mnuchin was on vacation, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was 2,000 miles away at a donor event in Jackson, Wyo.

Mulvaney struck an upbeat but realistic tone about the economy, according to one attendee who was not authorized to speak publicly.

He noted that there were signs of an economic slowdown but argued at length that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. He said if there was a recession, it would be “moderate and short,” according to an attendee who wasn’t authorized to disclose the comments.

When aides presented Trump with the news that the economy could weaken in the next year, it was just one scenario.

White House officials stressed that they still expect the economy to perform very strongly this year, with the gross domestic product growing 3 percent from 2018. Few others are as optimistic. The Fed estimates that GDP will grow just 2.1 percent.

By Wednesday, Trump had reversed himself again. He told reporters before boarding a helicopter that he had decided to rule out any new tax cuts after all.

“We don’t need it,” he said. “We have a strong economy.”

104,Does a booming economy make Trump unbeatable in 2020? - The Week,Does a booming economy make Trump unbeatable in 2020?

Despite President Trump's impeachment — not to mention his erratic, bullying, bigoted behavior — could the economy nonetheless hand him a second term in 2020?

It's definitely a possibility. In fact, a number of observers who run models of elections are already predicting Trump will take home the win. But nothing is certain, and such predictions hinge on the crucial assumption that economic indicators mean the same thing today that they meant one or two or three or more decades ago.

For a long time now, political science has recognized that the performance of the economy — especially its performance in the year before an election — has a very strong influence on how things shake out. Trump may well prove the exception, given both his outlandish personal characteristics, and the fact that he's now only the third president to ever actually be impeached by the House of Representatives. But an upward trending economy tends to mean victory for the incumbent, while an economy on the downturn tends to mean the challenger will win.

Yale University professor Ray Fair, Oxford Economics Ltd., and Moody's Analytics Inc. are all outfits that run election prediction models, for instance. They don't rely solely on the economy. But factors like GDP growth trends, inflation, and the unemployment rate play big roles in their projections. Bloomberg spoke to all three recently, and they were all predicting re-election for the White House's current occupant. ""The election is Trump's to lose,"" Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, bluntly put it. ""Trump wins if the economy and his approval rating are about the same a year from now as today, and turnout is typical."" Moody's has accurately called every election over the last two decades except for 2016. Oxford got 16 of the last 18 elections right.

Granted, these predictions all come with some caveats. But if you dig down into the nitty-gritty of economic data, below the headline numbers like unemployment and GDP growth, there are other positive signs for Trump. While wage growth overall remains somewhat sluggish compared to previous times when unemployment got this low, wage growth for low earners specifically has picked up in the last year or two. Poorer Americans are now seeing their incomes grow as fast as they did in the peak of the last recovery, just before the 2008 collapse. African-Americans and Hispanic Americans are enjoying record low unemployment rates.

Crazy as it may sound to many liberals, the Trump campaign thinks it can pick up some more votes among these minority groups. They don't think they can flip all that many. But Trump's team is basically aiming to replay his 2016 win, where he prevails despite his low approval ratings by holding key Rust Belt and battleground states, and thus keeps an edge in the Electoral College. Flipping even a modest number of minority voters in those states would definitely shore up the strategy's chances of success.

Yet there are other complications that push in the opposite direction.

For instance, in the last year, the economic situation in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan has taken a downturn. After a job boom in 2017 and 2018, the manufacturing sector reversed course, and has now bled out nearly all the jobs it gained since Trump entered office. Counties in the Midwest that switched their votes from President Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 have lost jobs in retail, mining, and natural resources, as well as manufacturing, and some of their unemployment rates have begun to inch back up.

That's a bad sign for Trump's strategy of holding his own in those crucial states. It's worth noting that many of these same communities were in something of a mini-recession in the runup to 2016 as well. As I said, economic conditions that are heading down tend to favor the challenger, and that probably goes a long way towards explaining why the Democrats' ""blue wall"" collapsed in 2016. In between 2016 and the last year, those areas enjoyed a rebound. It's just now they look like they're reversing course again.

Recent polling of battleground states found voters' satisfaction with their economic situation dropping, while they've gone from approving of Trump's handling of the economy by a net of 10 percentage points, to approving and disapproving in equal measure. If the slump continues for the next year, Trump will be the incumbent who likely pays the price.

It's also worth keeping in mind the guesswork behind models that look at things like GDP growth and the unemployment rate to predict election outcomes. The implicit assumption here is that the benefits of growing GDP or low unemployment are broadly shared across American society — and thus will reliably lift voters' moods across a wide swath of areas.

But that assumption is looking more and more rickety. Rising inequality inherently means that the same amount of GDP growth benefits fewer people. In the broader context, the recent uptick in wage growth is a minor shift in a decades-long trend of stagnating wages. Over the same time period, costs for things like housing, health care and child care have risen significantly. Meaning we actually need a much longer burst of high wage growth today for Americans to reach the same level of financial security they had during, say, the late 1990s boom. The unemployment rate also has problems, and other indicators suggest that low unemployment rates are less indicative today of the true health of the labor market than they were two decades ago. Finally, real GDP growth, while it's positive, is significantly slower today than it was two decades back in the 1990s, never mind in the 1960s.

Americans feel all this, too. According to recent polling, two thirds of voters think the economy is helping the rich; but only a third say it's helping the middle class, and even fewer say it's helping the poor.

What all this means, ultimately, is not necessarily that the economy is actually bad news for Trump. It simply might be less good news than it first appears. The election is still almost a year out, and a lot could happen in both directions. Despite his low popularity, Trump's job approval on the economy specifically remains 52 percent.

The president still has plenty of routes to victory.

105,1. Views of Trump - Pew Research Center,1. Views of Trump  Pew Research Center,"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3Jlc2VhcmNoLm9yZy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDE5LzAxLzE4LzEtdmlld3Mtb2YtdHJ1bXAtMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Pew Research Center,"The public’s confidence in Trump to handle a number of key issues remains mixed. Trump fares best on issues related to economic conditions, where about half of Americans say they are at least somewhat confident in his ability. By contrast, only about a third express confidence in his ability to work effectively with Congress.

Overall, 62% say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump’s ability to work effectively with Congress; far fewer (35%) say they are very or somewhat confident in him to do this.

When it comes to making wise decisions about immigration policy, four-in-ten say they are at least somewhat confident in Trump (including 29% who say they are very confident). Nearly six-in-ten (58%) express little or no confidence in Trump on immigration policy, including 45% who say they are not at all confident in him on this issue.

Narrow majorities also say they have little or no confidence in Trump to use military force wisely, handle an international crisis or manage the executive branch effectively. About half (51%) say they are not too or not at all confident that Trump can make good appointments to the federal courts, while 45% say they are at least somewhat confident in him in this area.

Trump garners the most confidence in his ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries (51% say they are at least somewhat confident) and to make good decisions about economic policy (49%). Still, close to half the public says they lack confidence in Trump to handle these two issue areas.

Nearly nine-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (89%) are confident in Trump’s ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries, compared with just 19% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.

The pattern is similar on most other issues. For instance, 89% of Republicans – and only 17% of Democrats – are very or somewhat confident in Trump to make good decisions about economic policy.

Trump gets his lowest ratings from Republicans on his ability to work effectively with Congress: Seven-in-ten say they are at least somewhat confident in his ability to do this, but just 31% say they are very confident. Across all other issues, at least 50% of Republicans say they are very confident in Trump.

Broad concern over possible influence of Trump’s business interests

Only about three-in-ten Americans (28%) are very confident that Trump keeps his own business interests separate from the decisions he makes as president, and another 13% say they are somewhat confident in this. A majority are either not too (16%) or not at all (41%) confident that Trump is keeping his own personal interests separate from his presidential decisions.

Most Republicans say they are very (55%) or somewhat (23%) confident that Trump keeps his business interests separate from his decision-making as president. Conservative Republicans are much more likely to say they are very confident in this (66%) than are moderate and liberal Republicans (39%).

Democrats are deeply skeptical that Trump is avoiding potential conflicts of interest. Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say that they are not at all confident that Trump keeps his business interests and his presidential decisions separate, while another 20% say they are not too confident in this. Liberal Democrats are particularly skeptical: Fully 83% say they are not at all confident in Trump to keep his business interests separate.

Most say Trump should release tax returns

In surveys over the past two years, a majority of Americans have said that Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns. Currently, 64% say he has this responsibility, slightly higher than the share who said this last year. About a third of the public (32%) says he does not have this responsibility.

Fully 91% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say that Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns, up from about eight-in-ten who said this in both January 2018 (80%) and January 2017 (79%).

By contrast, most Republicans continue to say that Trump does not have a responsibility to release his tax returns: Just 32% say he has this responsibility, while 64% say he does not.

Trump’s statements less trusted than those of previous presidents

A majority of the public (58%) says they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office. Just 26% say they trust Trump more than previous presidents, while 14% say their level of trust in Trump’s rhetoric is about the same as for past presidents.

Distrust in Trump compared with other presidents has increased since April of 2017, when a somewhat smaller share (51%) said they trusted what Trump says less than previous presidents.

Almost all Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (94%) say they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office.

Among Republicans and Republican leaners, most (58%) say they trust what Trump says more than previous presidents, while 25% say they trust what he says about the same as previous presidents; 15% say they trust his rhetoric less.

Low marks for ethical standards of top administration officials

Views of the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials remain at record lows compared with previous administrations dating back to the 1980s.

Overall, 39% rate the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials as either excellent (7%) or good (32%). A much greater share describes them as either not good (20%) or poor (39%). These ratings are about the same as they were in May 2018.

Views of Trump administration officials are lower than those of officials in the previous five administrations, often measured at times of specific ethical controversies.

Partisans remain deeply divided on this question, with 76% of Republicans and Republican leaners saying that ethical standards of top administration officials are excellent or good (although only 16% say they are “excellent”), and 90% of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying that ethical standards of top Trump administration officials are not good or poor (with 67% saying they are “poor”).

Trump’s impact on economy seen as positive, on balance

While the public is critical of Trump and his administration in multiple areas, they see Trump’s impact on the economy in a positive light. Overall, 40% think that Trump’s policies have made economic conditions better since taking office, compared with fewer (28%) who say they have made conditions worse; 29% say they have not had much of an effect.

Since October 2017, the share saying Trump’s economic policies have not had much of an effect has declined 20 points. There have been comparable increases in the shares who say his policies have made things better (+11 points) and worse (+10 points).

Partisan views of Trump’s economic policies have become more polarized since the fall of 2017. Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) say that his economic policies had improved conditions in the country (up from 63% in October 2017). Democrats and Democratic leaners, by contrast, have grown more negative in their views of Trump’s economic policies. Almost half (46%) of Democrats now say his policies have made the economy worse, up from 28% in October 2017.

How will Trump’s presidency be viewed in the long run?

When asked if they think Donald Trump will be a successful or unsuccessful president in the long run, 47% say he will be unsuccessful, while about three-in-ten (29%) say he will be successful; 23% say it is too early to tell whether Trump will be successful or unsuccessful. Since last year, the share saying Trump will be successful and the share saying he will be unsuccessful have both increased by 6 percentage points.

The share who say it is too early to tell if Trump will be successful is much lower than at comparable points for previous presidents. At the start of Barack Obama’s third year in office, nearly half of the public (47%) said it was too early to tell whether he would be successful; 38% said this about George W. Bush and 43% about Clinton at comparable points.

The nearly half of Americans (47%) who now say Trump will be unsuccessful is far higher than the share who said this about his three most recent predecessors at comparable points in their first term.

About two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (65%) say Trump will be a successful president in the long run.

An even larger share of Democrats and Democratic leaners (80%) think that Trump will be an unsuccessful president.

Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to say it is too early to tell whether Trump will be successful (25% vs. 16%).

In January 2011, about half of Republicans (47%) said Obama would be unsuccessful, while nearly as many (45%) said it was too early to tell. Among Democrats, 43% said Obama would be successful and 47% said it was too early to tell.

Republicans’ views of Trump’s long-term outlook are similar to how they viewed Bush in his third year. In December 2003, 69% of Republicans thought Bush would be successful; just 28% said it was too early to tell. Democrats’ views of Bush were not as fully established: 37% thought he would be unsuccessful, while 43% said it was too early to tell.

Views of Mueller investigation

Overall, 55% of the public says they are very or somewhat confident that Robert Mueller is conducting a fair investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. A smaller share (41%) says they are not too or not at all confident in Mueller.

There is less public confidence in Trump to appropriately handle matters related to the special counsel’s investigation. Just 37% are very or somewhat confident in Trump to handle matters related to the investigation appropriately, compared with 60% who say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump to do this.

Views of the Mueller investigation – and Trump’s handling of the matter – remain deeply partisan.

About seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (72%) are at least somewhat confident in the fairness of Mueller’s investigation. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, a larger share says they are not too or not at all confident in Mueller (58%) than says they are very or somewhat confident in him (39%).

When it comes to Trump’s handling of matters related to the investigation, fully 92% of Democrats express a lack of confidence in Trump, including 70% who say they are not at all confident in him. Three-quarters of Republicans say they are confident in Trump to handle the inquiry appropriately, including 42% who say they are very confident.

Confidence in the Mueller investigation has not changed much over the course of the past year. In January and September of 2018, an identical 55% said they were at least somewhat confident that Mueller was conducting a fair investigation in to Russian involvement in the 2016 election."

As 2019 comes to a close, the US economy earns its highest ratings in almost two decades, potentially boosting President Donald Trump in matchups against the Democrats vying to face him in next year’s election, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.

Overall, 76% rate economic conditions in the US today as very or somewhat good, significantly more than those who said so at this time last year (67%). This is the highest share to say the economy is good since February 2001, when 80% said so.

Almost all Republicans (97%) say economic conditions are good right now, as do 75% of independents and 62% of Democrats. Positive ratings are up across parties compared with August of this year, when 91% of Republicans, 62% of independents and 47% of Democrats said the economy was in good shape.

Looking ahead, nearly 7 in 10 expect the economy to be in good shape a year from now (68%), the best outlook in CNN polling since December 2003. The new finding includes 63% who say things are good now and will continue to be good next year, while just 9% say they economy is currently good but will turn south in 2020.

The matchups against Trump

As perceptions of the economy have brightened, the poll also shows matchups between the top Democrats vying for the 2020 nomination and Trump tightening. In October, four Democrats tested in hypothetical head-to-head contests with Trump among registered voters lead by anywhere from six to 10 percentage points, all advantages outside that poll’s margin of sampling error.

Now, just two of those candidates hold edges at or above the error margin: former Vice President Joe Biden leads Trump nationally 49% to 44%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tops Trump 49% to 45%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg each run about even with the President.

The poll was conducted before the House voted to impeach Trump on Wednesday and the Democrats held their sixth primary debate on Thursday.

Across battleground states (a group which includes the 15 states decided by 8 points or less in 2016) – all four Democrats run within the margin of error of Trump. Biden and Trump tie at 47% each, while Trump holds 48% support to Warren’s 46%, 48% to Buttigieg’s 43%, and 49% to Sanders’ 45%.

The tighter margins against the president come as favorability ratings appear to be sliding for the top Democratic contenders, according to results from the same poll released earlier this week. Biden notches his first net-negative rating in CNN’s polling since 2015, with 39% now holding a favorable view and 47% unfavorable.

Sanders splits the public: 43% see him favorably, 44% unfavorably, a dip since October but about on par with his ratings earlier this year.

Warren’s favorable numbers have slipped 4 points since October and are significantly net-negative now, 34% favorable to 43% unfavorable. Buttigieg has seen an uptick in unfavorable views (27% now, up from 23% in October) to match his favorable rating (27%), but he remains the least-well-known of the top Democratic contenders, with 46% saying they haven’t heard of him or don’t know enough to have an opinion.

The President’s favorability rating has remained steady since CNN’s October poll – 43% have a favorable opinion of Trump, 53% unfavorable.

But shifts in views on the Democratic candidates may not be as negative a sign as they were in 2016. Those registered voters who hold an unfavorable opinion of Trump and his Democratic opponent are much more likely to favor the Democratic candidate over Trump in that matchup. Among those who have a negative opinion of both Trump and Biden, for example, 72% support Biden in a hypothetical matchup while 9% prefer Trump. Those who don’t like either Sanders or Trump break for Sanders, 59% to 18%, and the pattern holds for Warren and Buttigieg as well.

In 2016, by contrast, those who had an unfavorable opinion of both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Trump broke for Trump 47% to 30% for Clinton, with 19% backing third party candidates, according to exit polls.

Trade and USMCA

More than half (55%) approve of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – the new trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada which would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, fulfilling a prominent campaign promise in Trump’s 2016 run for the presidency.

Fewer (13%) disapprove and around a third aren’t sure or don’t have an opinion of Trump’s proposed trade deal. Already, the agreement provokes partisan division, with 70% of Republicans approving, 53% of independents and 44% of Democrats.

Seven in 10 see foreign trade generally as more of an opportunity for economic growth through increased US exports (71%) rather than a threat to the economy from foreign imports (16%), steady since this time last year. On that, there is rare partisan agreement. Around seven in 10 Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree that foreign trade is an opportunity for growth.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS December 12 through 15 among a random national sample of 1,005 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among the subset of 888 registered voters, the error margin is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points."

The strategy directs the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) to locate domestic supplies of those minerals, ensure access to information necessary for the study and production of minerals, and expedite permitting for minerals projects.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, today’s federal strategy lays out a blueprint for America to once again be a leader in the critical minerals sector,” said Secretary David Bernhardt. “As with our energy security, the Trump Administration is dedicated to ensuring that we are never held hostage to foreign powers for the natural resources critical to our national security and economic growth. The Department will work expeditiously to implement the President's strategy from streamlining the permitting process to locating domestic supplies of minerals.”

Currently, the U.S. relies on other countries completely for more than a dozen of minerals that are vital to our economy and security. These minerals are used for things like cell phones, computers, automobiles, airplanes, ships, and many other products that are critical to our economy and security.

In 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13817, A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals. This Executive Order called on agencies across the federal government to develop a strategy to reduce the Nation’s susceptibility to critical mineral supply disruptions.

In May of 2018, DOI took the first step in the strategy, releasing a list of 35 minerals deemed critical to the U.S. economy and security, based on a methodology by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). This list forms the foundation of the full strategy, which entails a number of other actions that the Department will take.

Faster Permitting

Mining remains the most important method for acquiring critical minerals, and Federal lands provide significant opportunities for mining. Prolonged Federal permitting and land management policies have inhibited access to and the development of domestic critical minerals, which has contributed to an increased reliance on foreign sources of minerals.

To reduce unnecessary permitting delays and increase access to critical minerals, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which is responsible for onshore mineral rights and mining on lands managed by BLM, will undertake a comprehensive review of its permitting and land classifications, as well as its management plans. The BLM administers more than 245 million surface acres of public land and 700 million acres of subsurface mineral estate and is committed to implementing efficiencies for the environmentally responsible development of critical minerals on Federal lands. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will undertake a similar review for mineral permitting in the Federal Offshore and Exclusive Economic Zone.

Finding New Sources of Domestic Minerals

The U.S. is blessed with an abundance of mineral resources, but many of the easy-to-find deposits have been discovered. New deposits, both onshore and offshore, are increasingly located deeper underground and are more difficult to find. To find these new deposits of critical minerals, the USGS has embarked on a new nationwide program of surface and subsurface mapping – the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative – to better inform the country about its critical minerals potential. The BOEM has initiated a complementary effort to better evaluate the nation’s offshore mineral potential.

Mining is not the only way to secure critical minerals. Alternatives, such as recycling, processing mine waste, extraction from seawater, or even filtering them from energy byproducts, could prove valuable sources for critical minerals. USGS will assist other Federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture and DOI bureaus like the BLM and BOEM, with evaluating these unconventional methods for bolstering the traditional supplies of critical minerals.

Better Information

Managing the supply of critical minerals depends on using the best information. Data on mining, processing, and transporting critical minerals are essential to strengthening domestic supply chains, and the USGS will continue to supply that data through a variety of authoritative scientific publications. Those data inform biennial re-evaluations of which minerals are critical to the United States.

In addition, the USGS will conduct at least one multi-commodity critical mineral resource assessment every two years, supplying the results to Federal land managers and the public. Meanwhile, BOEM will work with partners such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop a method for assessing critical mineral potential in the Federal Offshore and Exclusive Economic Zone.

About Interior

DOI is entrusted with the conservation and management of the Nation’s natural resources and cultural heritage for the benefit and enjoyment of the American people and future generations, which includes more than 500 million acres of Federal lands and resources.

109,How has Michigan fared in Trump’s economy? - MLive.com,How has Michigan fared in Trump’s economy?  MLive.com,"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTkvMDkvaG93LWhhcy1taWNoaWdhbi1mYXJlZC1pbi10cnVtcHMtZWNvbm9teS5odG1s0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAxOS8wOS9ob3ctaGFzLW1pY2hpZ2FuLWZhcmVkLWluLXRydW1wcy1lY29ub215Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,MLive.com,"Michigan employment is at its highest level since October 2005. Wages and salaries are continuing to trend up. The state’s economy is growing.

As President Donald Trump heads into the 2020 presidential campaign, Michigan is a must-win state and one of his strongest arguments for re-election is a booming economy.

“We’ve cut taxes, rolled back regulation,” Vice President Mike Pence said during a recent speech before the Detroit Economic Club. Trump “promised to pursue great trade deals for our country, and to unleash an energy revolution. And three years later, President Donald Trump delivered.""

Fellow Republicans are appreciative. “We’ve seen positive results under Trump,"" said state Sen. Ken Horn, R-Frankenmuth, who chairs the Senate Economic and Small Business Development Committee.

Others disagree. Despite strong employment and rising wages, Trump’s economic policies have resulted in “a very mixed record” for Michigan, said Charles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University.

“I would say it has to be almost certainly has to be a net minus,” based on what’s happened so far, said Alan Deardorff, an economist at University of Michigan. “But it will be quite a while before we’re going to have data to really know the impact.”

The two economists readily acknowledge the overall economy is strong. The United States is now in the 10th year of economic growth, the longest expansion since 1854.

But that’s essentially building on gains started under Obama, both Ballard and Deardorff said, adding the rate of growth in Michigan’s economy has actually slowed a bit by some measures.

In fact, on a number of measures of economic activity, increases in the final years of the Obama presidency outpaced the first years under Trump, based on federal statistics.

Michigan employment increased by about 111,300 jobs in the first 30 months of the Trump presidency. That compares to almost 205,000 in the last 30 months of the Obama administration.

The state added about 17,600 manufacturing jobs in the first 30 months under Trump compared to about 36,000 in the last 30 months under Obama.

Michigan unemployment rate was 4.9% when Trump took office. It’s currently 4.3%. In the last 30 months of the Obama presidency, the unemployment rate went from 7% to 4.9%.

Michigan’s average weekly wage rose 3.4% during the first two years under Trump, and was $1,078 for the first quarter of 2019. The average weekly wage rose 7.6% during the last two years of Obama’s presidency.

Michigan’s gross domestic product grew 7.7% in the first two years under Trump compared to 9.1% during the last two years under Obama.

One measure where Trump’s numbers look better is median wages, the number where half earn more and half earn less. In the most recent data, Michigan’s median weekly wage for full-time workers was $732.20 in May 2018, up 2.6% from May 2017. That’s the biggest one-year increase since 2005.

One reason Obama’s numbers look better is the state’s economy had plenty of room to grow after the recession. On the other hand, the numbers show most of Michigan’s recovery occurred under Obama, not Trump.

Ballard said the Republicans’ 2017 tax cut, which he termed as Trump’s “signature accomplishment” so far, seems to have helped to provide a “bit of a boost in 2018.""

But Ballard also characterized the tax cut as a “sugar high” with temporary impact. “You can’t expect that to have lasting big effects, because we were already pretty close to full employment,” he said. “Unemployment is not going to go down to 1%.""

Moreover, Ballard said, the tax cut was structured to benefit corporations and wealthy residents the most. “The rhetoric was that this was to lead to job growth, but don’t insult my intelligence,” he said. “It was to put money into the pockets of big corporations and directly or indirectly help help people with large stock market portfolios.”

And as it happens, the benefits of the tax cut for ordinary citizens is being offset by tax increases related to tariffs and Trump’s trade policy, another signature issue for the president.

The middle fifth of earners averaged a $780 tax cut for 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center. Meanwhile, tariffs are currently costing the average American household about $600 per year and that could rise to $1,000 per household if Trump carries through on his threat to increase tariffs on Chinese imports, according to an analysis by JPMorgan Chase.

“In my view, the possibility of a recession has been substantially increased by the trade war,” Ballard said.

Deardorff agreed the trade war has been a net negative for the economy. “All the states are losing from the tariffs in both directions, because they are making the supply chain of everything we produce and everything we buy more expensive,"" he said.

Kristin Dziczek, a vice president for the Center for Automotive Research Center in Ann Arbor, said the trade war has not been good for Michigan, where the auto industry is the state’s biggest economic driver.

“Everything is up in the air"" on trade, she said. “I can’t see that as a positive. ... It’s really puts a chill on investment.""

Steel tariffs in particular have increased costs for the U.S. automakers.

“Both Ford and General Motors cited that just the metals tariffs were costing them a billion dollars more a year on import prices for steel and aluminum,” Dziczek said. “Those have been removed on Canada and Mexico, but not on everybody else yet. That’s a big relief, but it’s not total relief from those tariffs.”

That’s combined with the “great uncertainty"" about the United States-Mexico-Canadian Agreement or USMCA, the NAFTA replacement yet to be ratified by Congress, as well as “great uncertainty” about future tariffs, she said.

Especially worrisome, she said, is Trump’s threat to impose additional tariffs on autos and auto parts from Japan and/or the European Union if the U.S. fails to reach new trade agreements by mid-November.

“That would have a much bigger impact” than what’s happened so far in the trade war, Dziczek said.

Her organization released a study in February to look at the impact of U.S. trade policies. In their worst-case scenario, USMCA is implemented in its current form; other tariffs “continue unmodified,” and Trump imposes tariffs on autos and auto parts for countries other than Canada, Mexico and South Korea.

In that event, the analysis estimated a loss of 367,000 U.S. jobs and an average price increase of $2,750 per car or light truck.

“That’s a real concern,” she said.

Dziczek, Ballard and Deardorff differ in their take on whether Michigan would be helped or hurt if the USMCA replaces NAFTA.

Ballard said the differences between the two agreements are minor, saying “it’s not even NAFTA 2.0. It’s NAFTA 1.1.""

Deardorff and Dziczek point to USMCA incentives that would encourage more auto production in the U.S.: Deardorff says that would hurt Michigan by increasing production costs; Dziczek takes the opposite stance, saying, “Michigan has a great shot” at getting some of those new jobs.

While Trump’s rollback of federal regulations has been credited as business-friendly move, that’s not necessary true in the auto industry -- specifically in terms of the current battle over gas mileage standards.

Trump has rolled back vehicle mileage standards adopted by the Obama administration. But California and 22 other states are seeking to keep the higher standards for vehicles sold in their states.

“Complying with new regulations on fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions involves investment,” Dziczek said. “And that investment is sitting on the sidelines, waiting to find out how all this is going to be resolved.”

Michael LaFaive, a fiscal policy expert for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank in Midland, said he’s enthusiastic about the Republican cut tax and Trump’s loosening of federal regulations. But he worries that’s being offset by the trade war, especially in Michigan where so much of the economy is tied to international trade.

“When you change trade policy, there are going to be winners and losers,” he said. “But on the balance, tariffs are just a tax on ourselves. And that’s playing itself out now.”

Like Deardorff, LaFaive said it’s too early to tell if Trump’s economy policies are a net negative or positive for Michigan.

“There are so many moving parts, and I don’t know how to tease out the impact of Donald Trump’s policies on the balance,"" he said. ""Obviously, I’m not pleased with these tariffs. They may be doing more harm than good. But there’s also the regulatory pullback. I don’t know how to factor all that in.

“I’d like to see how it all washes out,” he said."
110,Trump threatens to 'destroy' Turkey's economy with sanctions - The Associated Press,Trump threatens to 'destroy' Turkey's economy with sanctions  The Associated Press,"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N5cmlhLXR1cmtleS1yb2JlcnQtb2JyaWVuLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtbmV3cy1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtNzY3MDU0ZjFmOTlmNDAxOTlhODBiZmVhOGUxNmNjZGbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Targeting Turkey’s economy, President Donald Trump announced sanctions aimed at restraining the Turks’ assault against Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria — an assault Turkey began after Trump announced he was moving U.S. troops out of the way.

Some of those U.S. troops leaving northern Syria are being shifted to Iraq, where they could conduct cross-border operations against Islamic State group militants, a U.S. official said.

The United States also called on Turkey to stop the invasion and declare a cease-fire, and Trump is sending Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O’Brien to Ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations. Pence said on Monday that Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised not to attack the border town of Kobani, which in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group’s first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.

“President Trump communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence,” Pence said.

The Americans were scrambling for Syria’s exits, a move criticized at home and abroad as opening the door to a resurgence of the Islamic State group, whose violent takeover of Syrian and Iraqi lands five years ago was the reason American forces went in the first place.

Trump said the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops who had been partnering with local Kurdish fighters to battle the Islamic State in northern Syria are leaving the country. They will remain in the Middle East, he said, to “monitor the situation” and to prevent a revival of IS — a goal that even Trump’s allies say has become much more difficult as a result of the U.S. pullout.

The U.S. troops being withdrawn from northern Syria will reposition in Iraq, Kuwait and possibly Jordan, according to the U.S. official, who spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive planning for the U.S. pullout.

The official said the American troops have pulled out of the Manbij area, where U.S. outposts were set up in 2017. Troops are consolidating their positions to prepare to fly out of the country soon.

The official said the U.S. troops in Iraq could perform operations against the IS militants in Syria as they did before creating the now-abandoned partnership with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

The Turks began attacks in Syria last week against the Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the Turks see as terrorists. On Monday, Syrian government troops moved north toward the border region, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces.

Trump said Turkey’s invasion is “precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,” a reference to reports of Turkish-backed fighters executing Kurdish fighters on the battlefield.

The Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad’s government to help them fend off Turkey’s invasion, a move that brings Russian forces deeper into the conflict.

In his sanctions announcement, Trump said he was halting negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey and raising steel tariffs back up to 50%. Trump also imposed sanctions on three senior Turkish officials and Turkey’s defense and energy ministries.

“I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey’s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,” Trump said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will hurt an already weak Turkish economy. Pence said the U.S. will continue to ramp up the sanctions “unless Turkey is willing to embrace a cease-fire, come to the negotiating table and end the violence.”

American troops consolidated their positions in northern Syria on Monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal, a U.S. defense official said.

The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said U.S. officials were weighing options for a potential future counter-IS campaign, including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside Syria, perhaps in Iraq.

The hurried preparations for a U.S. exit were triggered by Trump’s decision Saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday he would travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to urge European allies to impose “diplomatic and economic measures” against Turkey, a fellow NATO ally, for what Esper called Ankara’s “egregious” actions.

Esper said Turkey’s incursion had created unacceptable risk to U.S. forces in northern Syria and “we also are at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict.”

The only exception to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria is a group of perhaps 200 troops who will remain at a base called Tanf in southern Syria near the Jordanian border along the strategically important Baghdad-to-Damascus highway. Those troops work with Syrian opposition forces unrelated to the Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.

Esper said the U.S. withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure no U.S. equipment was left behind. He declined to say how long that might take.

In a series of tweets Monday, Trump defended his gamble that pulling U.S. forces out of Syria would not weaken U.S. security and credibility. He took sarcastic swipes at critics who say his Syria withdrawal amounts to a betrayal of the Kurds and plays into the hands of Russia.

“Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,” he wrote. “I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!”

Trump has dug in on his decision to pull out the troops, believing it fulfills a key campaign promise and will be a winning issue in the 2020 election, White House officials say.

This has effectively ended a five-year effort to partner with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the Islamic State group. Hundreds of IS supporters escaped a holding camp amid clashes between invading Turkish-led forces and Kurdish fighters, and analysts said an IS resurgence seemed more likely, just months after Trump declared the extremists defeated.

Trump spoke about the IS detainees in a phone call Monday with Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani. Pence said Mazloum assured the Republican president that Kurdish forces would continue to support the prisons holding IS fighters.

Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, normally a staunch Trump supporter, said he was “gravely concerned” by events in Syria and Trump’s response.

Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria “would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,” he said in a statement.

New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump is weakening America.

“To be clear, this administration’s chaotic and haphazard approach to policy by tweet is endangering the lives of U.S. troops and civilians,” Menendez said in a statement.

The Kurds have turned to the Syrian government and Russia for military assistance. The prospect of enhancing the Syrian government’s position on the battlefield and inviting Russia to get more directly involved is seen by Trump’s critics as a major mistake.

111,Trump's Economic Falsehoods - FactCheck.org,Trump's Economic Falsehoods  FactCheck.org,"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY3RjaGVjay5vcmcvMjAxOS8xMS90cnVtcHMtZWNvbm9taWMtZmFsc2Vob29kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,FactCheck.org,"President Donald Trump rattled off several false claims in his Nov. 12 speech to the Economic Club of New York, in which he contrasted the supposedly “bleak” outlook at the end of his predecessor’s term with an exaggerated portrayal of the economy’s strong performance during his own tenure.

He said that when he was running for president in 2016 “America was stuck in a failed recovery and saddled with a bleak economic future. And it was bleak.” But as we wrote at the time he took office, “President Trump actually inherits an economy experiencing steady if unspectacular growth in output, jobs and incomes.” We noted that the economy had added 2.2 million jobs in the 12 months before Trump took office. That was later revised upward to nearly 2.5 million.

In his speech, Trump said: “Under the last administration, nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost.” That’s true enough; the loss was 193,000. But the number of manufacturing jobs had increased by more than 900,000 between the low point early in Barack Obama’s first term and the time Trump took office. And Trump failed to mention that total employment grew by 11.6 million under Obama.

Trump claimed that under Obama, “almost 5 million more Americans had left the labor force.” Not true. In fact, the civilian labor force grew by nearly 5.5 million under Obama.

The president said that “jobs were not exactly what you would call plentiful” under Obama. That’s also far from true. In March 2016 the number of unfilled job openings hit 6.1 million, the highest in the more than 15 years records had been kept. And when Trump took office, the number of unfilled jobs was still 5.6 million.

Trump said that in 2016, “the Department of Labor predicted that Americans would continue dropping out of the workforce in record numbers.” But that’s another falsehood. The Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics projection for 2016-2028 (actually issued in December 2015) was that the labor force would continue to grow — though at a slower pace because the population was aging and many were reaching retirement age.



BLS said then: “The labor force is anticipated to grow by 7.9 million, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 0.5 percent, over the 2014–24 period.” And despite Trump’s bragging, that outlook for 0.5% growth hasn’t changed. The most recent BLS 10-year projection says: “The labor force is projected to increase at an annual rate of 0.5 percent from 2018 to 2028.”

Trump said that before he took office, “[T]hey expected unemployment over 5% — and, really, 6, 7, and even, in some cases, 8% — for many years to come.” Not so. The Congressional Budget Office projected in August 2016 that unemployment would fall to 4.5% in 2017, and wouldn’t exceed 5% for the following decade.

That was in line with most economic forecasts. The median projection issued Dec. 14, 2016, by Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents was for a 4.5% unemployment rate in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And of 50 economists who offered a projection of the unemployment rate in the Wall Street Journal’s economic survey in November 2016, the average expectation was for a 4.6% unemployment rate in December 2018. Only two of the respondents thought the rate would be over 5%.

Trump claimed in his speech that “my administration has created nearly 7 million jobs, and going up rapidly.” This is exaggerated. Total employment has gone up by 6.25 million since Trump took office, well short of 7 million. As for “going up rapidly,” the average monthly gain for the most recent 12 months has been 174,000. That’s actually slower growth than during the 12 months before Trump took office, when the average monthly job gain was 207,000.

It’s true that job gains under Trump have exceeded what economists expected in 2016, but not by as much as he claimed in his speech. He said that “before I took office, the Congressional Budget Office projected that fewer than 2 million jobs would be created by this time in 2019.” And indeed, CBO’s 10-year economic projection in August 2016 was that total nonfarm employment would be 1.9 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2019 than in the fourth quarter of 2016. But Trump fails to note that CBO had revised that estimate upward just as he was taking office. On Jan. 24, 2017, it projected that the job gain would be 3.3 million.

So Trump would be justified in saying that during his tenure so far the economy produced nearly twice as many jobs as CBO predicted at the time he took office. But he was wrong to claim in his speech that the gain “beat predictions more than three times.”

Trump said: “Last year, GDP growth matched the fastest rate in more than a decade.” That’s true enough. In 2018, real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product increased by 2.9% over the previous year, matching the 2.9% growth in 2015, the only other time in the past 10 years growth has been that high. But growth has slowed since then to an annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter of this year. And of course, Trump had promised to do better than merely matching the best year of Obama’s presidency. He repeatedly promised growth of 4% to 6% per year, both when he was a candidate and also as president.

Trump repeated one of his favorite talking points, claiming that median household income has gone up $5,000 during his time. But as we reported earlier, that’s a shaky claim based on estimates produced from a survey that isn’t designed to measure income. The Census Bureau’s measure of median household income increased $1,400 (after adjusting for inflation), or 2.3%, during Trump’s first two years in office. Indications are that the figure has risen further during 2019, but by how much won’t be known until September 2020, when Census is due to release the 2019 figure.

There’s no question the economy has been strong since Trump took office, but it was also strong before he took office, a fact he continues to distort as he falsely puffs up his own record."

Those are numbers he can point to in his reelection campaign.

But two-plus years into Trump’s presidency, there's also a set of numbers that indicate some long-standing, problematic trends remain. And as the 2020 campaign begins those data points serve as a reminder that deeper economic change, the kind he promised in 2016, is hard to deliver.

Start with the overall state of the economy and who’s winning and losing in it. Yes, incomes are up and unemployment is down, but Census data released in September show income inequality not only persists, but it is also growing – even through the good economic times.

The Census data showed that the Gini Index, a measure of income inequality climbed to .485 in 2018 in the annual American Community Survey, up from .482. In the Gini, 0 equals perfect income equality and 1 equals perfect inequality and this year’s number represents a new high in the ACS data.

But the truth about that figure is it has been growing fairly steadily since the 1960s. The drift upward is simply not an easy trend to turn around. Changes in the job market and the structure of the U.S. economy in that time have led to a loss of middle-income jobs that propped up the middle class.

Another long-term challenge exists in Manufacturing jobs, a key economic number that Trump promised to revive to levels not seen in decades. There's been some positive movement, the jobs in manufacturing are up by about 500,000 since 2016 to about 12.8 million positions. But that number is far below the millions of new manufacturing jobs that the president to create and analyses show the sector is now contracting.

Even with the growth during Trump's time in office, the number of manufacturing jobs is not back to where it was in 2008 and it is still far behind where the number was in September of 2000 when there were 17.2 million manufacturing jobs in the United States.

And the truth is, this trend goes back decades. Manufacturing jobs are down 30 percent since 1980. Automation and greater factory efficiency has made this trend difficult too slow.

What about coal mining jobs? Miners were a big constituency for Trump in 2016. Again, there are some small signs of improvement here. Coal mining jobs are up slightly since Trump took office, but by a very small amount – only about 2,500 positions since January of 2017. And, in the broader view, the 53,300 people employed in coal mining today is still down sharply from the 89,300 people who worked as miners back in September of 2011.

That’s a drop of about 40 percent in coal mining jobs since then. And that decline is being driven by a range of factors, including alternative sources for power generation such as wind, solar and, of course, natural gas.

The decline in those jobs is not a sudden story either; it has deep roots. Back in 1990, more than 130,000 people worked in coal mining.

And in the heartland, where Trump won by large margins in rural areas with promises of better deals for those in agriculture, there are also long-term trends that are hitting family farms especially hard, forcing many out of business.

This week U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue acknowledged the issue and told reporters that it's getting harder for dairy farmers to make it with smaller herds. ""In America, the big get bigger and the small go out,"" Perdue said. ""I don't think in America we, for any small business, we have a guaranteed income or guaranteed profitability.""

They were harsh words, but the data bear out the point of farm size.

In the last 30 years, smaller farms, those with more than 50 acres and less than 2000 acres, have seen declines, some sizable. There was a 30 percent drop among farms with between 260 acres and 1999 acres of land. But there has been a 27 percent increase in the number of large farms, those with more than 2000 acres of land.

In other words, the “big get bigger and the small get out” is not a new trend under President Trump. It is the result of larger market influences that have been at work for decades, favoring larger farms that can work at a different scale.

The point here is not that Donald Trump has not succeeded in these areas, it's that ""success"" is remarkably difficult. Other politicians have promised similar economic renaissances and failed.

No one can wave a wand and bring back middle-class jobs or stop the advances of automation and alternative energy or the consolidation of farms.

And despite this week’s good jobs numbers, that’s a challenge looming for the Trump campaign in 2020. He was elected on the promise of big economic change. That kind of talk is good campaign fodder, but it can also become a political problem if and when voters find the big changes haven’t arrived."

Experts continue to debate the conflicting signals, but an equally telling question might be: How does the “Trump economy” compare to Barack Obama’s? President Trump constantly refers to the economy with descriptors such as “strong,” “terrific” and the “greatest in the history of our country,” but a closer look at the data shows a mixed picture in terms of whether the economy is any better than it was in Obama’s final years. The economy is growing at about the same pace as it did in Obama’s last years, and unemployment, while lower under Trump, has continued a trend that began in 2011.

The best case Trump can make for improvement since he took office is higher wages. The typical American worker’s pay is finally growing more than 3 percent a year, a level not seen since before the Great Recession. Similarly, consumer and business confidence surged after Trump’s election and has remained high, and manufacturing output (and jobs) also saw a noticeable jump in 2018 after Trump’s tax cut, although manufacturing is now struggling. There’s also been a drop in the number of Americans on food stamps.

But in other areas, Trump’s record does not look as rosy. Government debt and the trade deficit are climbing (while most economists don’t worry about the rising trade deficit, Trump made it a central part of his 2016 election campaign), and business investment is faltering as corporate leaders say they are wary of Trump’s trade war. The number of Americans lacking health insurance is also ticking up slightly.

As for two of Trump’s favorite metrics — stocks and jobs — there is a case to be made that those looked better under Obama, although most economists expected job gains to slow now that the economic recovery is a decade old.

Presidents have only so much control over the economy, but how voters perceive economic conditions and their personal finances can play a key role in how they vote. Lately, Republicans and many wealthy voters rate this economy as the best since the 1990s boom, while Democrats and many lower-income voters are less enthusiastic.

Here’s a look at the Trump economy vs. the Obama economy in 15 charts.

1. Job gains. The U.S. economy typically added more than 250,000 jobs each month in 2014 and 227,000 a month in 2015. Trump has not been able to top that yet, but experts say job growth remains surprisingly robust, especially given how many baby boomers are retiring and how many business owners complain they can’t find any more workers.

2. Unemployment rate. The nation’s unemployment rate is at a half-century low, a source of pride for Trump. But many economists have pointed out that the rate has been falling steadily since 2011, making it difficult to see much difference after Trump took office.

3. Growth. After a painful 2009, the economy has been growing for a decade. In the early years of the recovery, growth was lackluster, but it started to pick up in 2014 and 2015. Trump told America he could do even better as president, but his record so far looks similar to Obama’s final few years in office. While his tax cut and deregulatory push boosted growth in 2018, that appears to be fading as business owners grow concerned about the trade war.

4. Middle-class income. Most Americans saw a noticeable decline in their income during the Great Recession, and it took years for wages to recover. In 2017, a typical middle-class family finally saw their income climb above where it was in 1999. (Data for 2018 will be released in September.) Incomes have been rising steadily in recent years as more Americans get jobs.

5. Stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 46 percent at this point in Obama’s presidency vs. 25 percent for Trump. Stocks soared under Obama, and he ended his White House tenure with one of the best gains of any president in modern history. Trump started out with a lot of love from Wall Street as well, especially with his tax cut, but stocks have moved sideways since he began his trade war.

6. Food stamps. About 1 out of 7 Americans received food stamps (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) in 2013 in the aftermath of the Great Recession, as people struggled to find good-paying jobs again. The numbers came down slightly under Obama, and the decline has accelerated under Trump as more Americans have obtained jobs and the requirements to remain on food stamps have tightened.

7. Manufacturing. Trump campaigned heavily on reviving blue-collar industries and jobs. While service-sector jobs in health care, technology and hospitality rebounded quickly after the Great Recession, manufacturing did not. Trump’s tax cuts helped boost manufacturing in 2018 (blue-collar job growth hit the fastest pace since the early 1980s), but the president’s tariffs have since taken a toll, sending manufacturing into a “technical recession” in 2019.

8. Home prices. The housing market was at the heart of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and many Americans lost their homes or watched the value of their homes plummet. Home prices bounced back at the end of Obama’s term and have continued a steady climb under Trump.

9. Gas prices. Americans keep a close eye on gas prices and tend to get nervous when it climbs above $3 a gallon nationally, but for much of Obama’s second term and Trump’s first term, gas prices have remained under that key threshold.

10. Federal debt. The national debt swelled under Obama as the federal government spent money trying to rebuild the economy after the Great Recession. At the end of Obama’s term, the annual deficit had declined considerably, but it has since jumped up again under Trump because of his tax cut and increased government spending.

11. Wages. For much of Obama’s time in office, wages remained subdued, and his economic team cited lackluster wager gains as the “unfinished business” of his presidency. Under Trump, average hourly pay has climbed and is now growing more than 3 percent a year for the first time in more than a decade. There’s debate about how much credit Trump deserves for this, but his tax cuts and the jump in business optimism probably played a role. Concern is rising, however, that wage growth is stalling in 2019.

12. Consumer confidence. Confidence in the economy has jumped since Trump’s election. This is an area where there has been a clear break from Obama, although experts debate how much of a difference it has made. Normally when confidence rises, businesses and consumers spend more, but that hasn’t been the case, especially for businesses. Still, high confidence is probably playing a role in keeping the United States out of a recession, even as other parts of the world falter.

13. Trade deficit. The United States has purchased more from overseas than it has sold abroad for years, a situation known as a trade deficit. The trade deficit declined during the Great Recession but has since expanded, which is typically a sign that the U.S. economy is growing robustly. Trump campaigned on bringing the trade deficit down, but it has grown during his tenure.

14. Uninsured Americans. One of Obama’s key policy goals was to get more Americans health insurance. The number of people without health insurance fell noticeably during his tenure after the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Progress has since stalled under Trump, who attempted (unsuccessfully) to repeal Obamacare."

Powell. It’s not that risky a prediction. Trump’s already telegraphing his frustrations with Powell who, Trump apparently feels, increased interest rates too early, slowing economic growth. And for Trump, everything in 2020 comes down to the economy. Setting aside the obvious importance of his aggressive and often toxic proposals on immigration, Trump’s 2016 election was predicated on being the business guy who could right an already mostly righted economy. If he doesn’t have that, what’s the pitch?

The president and his team have so far projected confidence about both the health of the economy and how that health will translate into electoral success. Historically, strong economic numbers have meant positive results for the incumbent president’s party. But then, strong economic numbers have also usually meant not getting blown out in midterm elections and, thanks in large part to Trump’s low approval numbers, that’s exactly what happened in November.

So we can say it like this: A strong economy isn’t a guarantee of victory for Trump, but it’s probably a necessity for Trump to win. And with the economy looking a bit more wobbly these days, that’s an ominous sign for Trump. And probably for Powell.

New Washington Post-ABC News polling released Tuesday suggests that economic uncertainty could lead to political weakness for the president.

There have been a few constants over the course of the past four years. Nonwhite Americans are broadly skeptical of Trump. White Americans are more receptive, with whites who don’t have a college degree — a group that tends to skew older — offering Trump the most robust support.

That has been consistent in approval numbers from Post-ABC polling over the course of Trump’s presidency. Whites with and without college degrees approve of Trump’s job performance at lower rates than they voted for him in 2016 (according to Pew Research Center exit poll analysis), but approval among college-educated whites has been closer to that 2016 vote figure.

(This is admittedly a bit apples-to-oranges, but a comparison to 2016 does give us some sort of benchmark to evaluate how Trump is doing.)

Where things get interesting is when we break out those non-college numbers by gender. The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein pointed this out: White women without college degrees are much less supportive of Trump now than they were in November 2016. Our new poll has that group 14 percentage points less approving of Trump as president than it was of Trump as a candidate — and indicates that approval of Trump has dropped dramatically since our July poll.

That drop is more significant than the approval drop among college-educated whites and correlates with a more subtle, not-statistically significant drop in the percentage of white women without degrees who view the economy positively. Among college-educated whites, the drop in positive views of the economy was steeper; that group for the first time in our polling views the economy less positively than white men without college degrees.

Notice, too, how views of the economy just before Trump took office (at far left) were similar among white men and white women without college degrees — but over Trump’s presidency, a gap has emerged between those groups.

White women without college degrees now view the economy about the same as Americans overall on net. Within that group, there’s a 17-point gap between those who view the economy positively and those who view it negatively, about the same as the overall 13-point gap. Among nonwhites, the spread goes the other direction: Nonwhites are 13 points more likely to view the economy negatively than positively.

Again, we see that gap between white men without degrees and white women without degrees. That appears in views of how Trump is handling the economy, as well. White men without degrees overwhelmingly approve of how Trump is doing on the economy while white women without degrees are more split. (Overall, less than half of Americans approve of how Trump’s doing on the economy.)

At the big picture level, those data aren’t terrible for Trump. White women without college degrees — a group that made up a quarter of the electorate in 2016, according to Pew, and that backed Trump by 23 points — still are more likely to approve of how Trump’s doing on the economy than not.

Dig into specifics, and the picture gets more grim.

Share this article Share

For example, most women in that group think a recession is likely next year — by a 24-point margin. White men without degrees are significantly less pessimistic.

What’s more, more than 4 in 10 of those white women without degrees think Trump’s policies are increasing the risk of there being a recession.

Most white women without degrees disapprove of Trump’s handling of trade negotiations with China.

There’s a wide, noteworthy gulf between the views of white men without degrees and white women without degrees on this point. White men are 30 points more likely to approve of Trump’s handling of the trade war than to disapprove. White women without degrees are 16 points more likely to disapprove.

A similar gap appears on a much more tangible question. Asked whether they are concerned about the trade war increasing prices, two-thirds of white women without degrees say that is a concern. More than half of their male counterparts say they aren’t concerned — the only group of those illustrated below in which a majority isn’t worried about price increases.

It’s tricky to suss out where causality lies here: Are white women without degrees more skeptical of Trump generally and therefore less likely to support his economic arguments, or are economic concerns pushing down support for Trump? This is also one poll; it will be important to track how these views evolve over the course of the 2020 campaign.

Whites without college degrees made up 63 percent of Trump’s votes in 2016, according to Pew’s analysis. If the economy is tamping down enthusiasm among half of that group, that’s an ominous sign for Trump’s reelection."
119,Perspective | Why Trump isn't getting credit from voters for good economic news - The Washington Post,Perspective | Why Trump isn't getting credit from voters for good economic news  The Washington Post,"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vdXRsb29rLzIwMTkvMTIvMjYvd2h5LXRydW1wLWlzbnQtZ2V0dGluZy1jcmVkaXQtdm90ZXJzLWdvb2QtZWNvbm9taWMtbmV3cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"In the past two weeks, good economic news has buoyed the Trump administration, providing a welcome distraction from his impeachment. Job growth in November exceeded expectations — 266,000 new jobs, unemployment down to 3.5 percent — prompting immediate speculation by commentators about the implications for President Trump’s reelection. Although not every indicator suggests that the economy is strong, most commentators thought that these job numbers helped Trump. CNN’s Chris Cillizza argued, for instance, that the numbers “make one thing very clear: President Donald Trump has a path to win a second term next year.”

There’s just one problem with such arguments: Voters aren’t giving Trump much credit for the growing economy, making his path to reelection less smooth than it otherwise should be, given the impressive statistics.

Since the administration of President John F. Kennedy, thanks to the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment, we’ve had a good reading of how people feel about the general economic climate. This index is based on a monthly survey that asks a random sample of Americans five questions about their personal finances as well as overall business conditions. (Higher values on this index mean more favorable views. Over the past 60 or so years, the highest value reached was 112 and the lowest was 52.)

Advertisement

From the beginning of the survey through the administration of President George W. Bush, there was a fairly straightforward relationship: Higher scores on this index equal better approval ratings. But Trump’s approval rating hasn’t budged, even though people’s views of the economy have grown more positive since he took office in 2017.

In fact, Trump’s approval rating is about 15 points lower than we’d predict from the historical relationship between economic evaluations and presidential approval. Right now, about 43 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump’s doing, even though unemployment is lower than economists once thought possible (without causing inflation).

By comparison, in November 1983, as President Ronald Reagan began his reelection campaign, 60 percent approved of him even though consumer sentiment was less positive than it was last month — 91.1 on the University of Michigan scale vs. 96.8. Reagan reaped the benefits of positive economic feelings. Trump hasn’t.

Trump is much more similar to President Barack Obama in this respect than to Reagan. Obama’s approval ratings also remained stubbornly low even as consumer sentiment increased during his two terms in office.

Perhaps some of Trump’s relatively low popularity is because he inspires such strong feelings in his detractors. Some of that can’t be ruled out. But much of this disjuncture between views of the economy and presidential approval isn’t about Trump as a person so much as the growing polarization of our politics.

Republicans and Democrats today, for instance, evaluate the economy more favorably when their party controls the White House. This fact was clearly on display after Trump’s election, when — though the facts remained the same — Republicans immediately began to view the economy more positively, while Democrats suddenly found fault with it. In Gallup polling, the percentage of Republicans who said the economy was getting better increased from 15 percent in October 2016 to 80 percent in February 2017, while the percentage of Democrats saying this fell from 62 percent to 27 percent.

In short, it’s hard for presidents today to get credit from the other party when they preside over a strong economy.

If Trump is less popular than the economic numbers would predict, that means there’s a substantial number of voters who think the economy is doing well but don’t approve of him. Who are they? And next Election Day, which will win out — their economic feelings or their disapproval of the president? New survey data from Nationscape, a project of UCLA and the Democracy Fund, can shed some light on these questions.

Share this article Share

In surveys conducted from Nov. 21 to Dec. 4 among 12,800 respondents, 36 percent said that the economy was doing better than a year ago, 41 percent said it was about the same, and 23 percent said it was worse.

Among those who said it was worse, almost everyone, 89 percent, disapproved of Trump and they were also overwhelmingly Democratic. Trump can probably write these people off.

Advertisement

Potentially more interesting subsets of voters are the 6 percent who said that the economy was doing better but disapproved of Trump, and the 28 percent who said the economy was about the same and disapproved of him.

Could many of these people end up voting for him next year? Probably not. Of the first group — the 6 percent — two-thirds are Democrats and 75 percent would vote for former vice president Joe Biden if he ends up running against Trump, vs. 13 percent who would vote for Trump, with the rest unsure. (In a matchup between Elizabeth Warren and Trump, 62 percent would vote for Warren, 17 percent for Trump, and the balance uncertain.)

Of the 28 percent who disapprove of Trump but think the economy has remained stable, an even larger fraction identify as Democrats (74 percent) and say they would vote for Democratic candidates.

In other words, when people think the economy is doing the same or better than a year ago but disapprove of Trump, it’s their feelings about Trump that win out. To get his approval ratings up, Trump needs to convince at least some of these people to give him a little credit for the economy.

Incumbent presidents running in growing economies often pursue such a strategy, as the UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck has shown. They focus their reelection campaign on reminding voters about the economic tail winds — as Reagan did in 1984 when he talked about “Morning in America.” When incumbents running in good economies do this, they’re more likely to win. (Not all candidates follow this seemingly intuitive strategy: Vavreck shows that in the 2000 election, former vice president Al Gore did not focus on the strong economic growth during the Clinton years — and, of course, ended up losing.)

To date, Trump has struggled to stick with that message. He will occasionally boast about the economy, but then get sidetracked by other issues. During the 2018 campaign, Republican politicians desperately wanted Trump to talk up the economy, only to see him focus on immigration and especially the migrant caravan traveling north toward the U.S.-Mexico border. Republican fears were then confirmed when Democrats took the House.

Two years ago Friday, Republicans in Congress passed a sweeping tax cut. It was supposed to be a gift-wrapped present to taxpayers and the economy. But in hindsight, it looks more like a costly lump of coal.

Passed on a party-line vote, the tax cut is the signature legislative accomplishment of President Trump's first term. He had campaigned hard for the measure, promising it would boost paychecks for working people.

""Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America,"" he told supporters in the fall of 2017. ""The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe-fitters, the people that like me best.""

In fact, more than 60% of the tax savings went to people in the top 20% of the income ladder, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The measure also slashed the corporate tax rate by 40%.

""It will be rocket fuel for our economy,"" Trump promised.

Boosters of the tax cut insisted the economy would grow so fast, it would more than make up for the revenue lost to lower rates.

""The tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.

It hasn't worked out that way.

""It was unbelievable at the time, and it's proven to be absolutely untrue,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The tax cuts were never going to — and have not — come anywhere close to paying for themselves.""

Corporate tax revenues fell 31% in the first year after the cut was passed. Overall tax revenues have declined as a share of the economy in each of the two years since the tax cut took effect.

""Not surprising, if you cut taxes, you get less in revenues,"" MacGuineas said. ""And what we've been doing at the same time is we've been increasing spending. And no surprise, our deficit has exploded.""

The federal deficit this year was $984 billion — an extraordinary figure at a time when the country is not mired in recession or widespread war.

The tax cut also failed to produce a permanent boost in economic growth, despite promises from Republican supporters.

""After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance, America is ready to take off,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said when the tax cut passed two years ago.

In fact, the economy grew 2.9% last year — exactly the same as in 2015.

The tax cut, along with increased government spending, did give a short-term lift to the economy and businesses temporarily boosted investment. But the rocket fuel burned off quickly. Business investment declined in the last two quarters.

""There was an acceleration in terms of momentum for business investment, but it was rather short-lived,"" said Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics. ""A year further down the road, we're really not seeing much of any leftover of this fiscal stimulus package.""

Hampered in part by the president's trade war, the economy is projected to grow only about 2% this coming year. That's below the administration's target of 3% and slightly below the average growth rate since 2010.

To be sure, the stock market is booming, and unemployment is near record lows. But while most Americans give the economy high marks, that doesn't extend to the tax cut. A Gallup Poll last tax season found only about 40% of Americans approved of the cut while 49% disapproved.

Even though experts say most workers did get a bump in their take-home pay, it was largely invisible to many taxpayers. Only about 14% of those surveyed by Gallup believe their taxes went down. (That figure includes 22% of Republicans, 12% of Democrats and 10% of independents.)

""For millions of middle-class Americans, it is not a very happy anniversary,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said while wealthy Americans are celebrating their tax savings from the past two years, working people feel like an afterthought.

Perhaps it's an acknowledgement of that sentiment that the president is now talking about another round of tax cuts, after the 2020 election. ""We're going to be doing a major middle-income tax cut, if we take back the House,"" Trump promised in November.

The president made similar promises before last year's midterm election. But the follow-up to his 2017 tax cut never materialized."

That was particularly the case in tabloids in New York, where Trump struggled to climb out from beneath some tough headlines that undermined his carefully crafted master-businessman brand.

Since then, Trump has revisited a theme when talking about economic crashes: emphasizing the opportunity in them.

As he has entered the political realm and now presides over an uncertain economy that could make or break his 2020 reelection, he has also talked about the political utility — and even the necessity — of recessions and crashes.

Trump’s most infamous comment on this came before he launched his 2016 campaign. During one of his frequent appearances on “Fox and Friends” in 2014, he talked with the hosts about how Democrats have a political advantage in offering people government benefits, even if those things might hurt the country’s economy.

“You know what solves it?” he said. “When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster, then you’ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.”

But that’s hardly the only time he has talked about how downturns can be turned into an advantage. Here’s a recap.

1992: “I used to say — and in fact I think I said in my first book, and maybe this was foolish, but I really meant it — that someday I’d like to maybe lose everything for a period of time to see who’s loyal and who’s not loyal.” (Interview with Charlie Rose)

1999: While considering a Reform Party candidacy for president in 2000:

GERALDO RIVERA: Are we headed for a crash? Are we headed — do you hear the bears galloping across Central Park? TRUMP: Well, I hope not, and I think not, but I will say this: The Reform Party nominee will have a lot better chance if there is a crash, and it could — you know, something pretty catastrophic could happen. I don’t think so. I hope it’s going to go on. ... I’m actually rooting for a great economy. I have to tell you. if I have my choice — you mean, do I get more votes? I’d like to see the economy stay. Too many people get hurt the other way.

1999: “If the economy is bad at the time of the election — and you know, we have a long way to go, and lots of things can happen — the Reform Party candidate would, if it’s the right candidate, have a good chance.” (Matt Lauer interview)

2004: While discussing the construction of Trump Place: “To be honest, the near collapse of New York during the 1990s is what got it done. If New York had been doing well, we would never have gotten the zoning for that job. It’s always good to get zoning in bad times and build in good times.” (Playboy interview)

2004: “I don’t want to blame the real estate markets, because I always made a lot of money in bad markets. I love bad markets. You can do very well in a bad market.” (CNN interview)

2006: On predictions that the housing market was headed for a crash: “I sort of hope that happens, because then people like me would go in and buy. … If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money. If you’re in a good cash position — which I’m in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.” (Trump University audiobook “How to Build a Fortune”)

2007: “We’re talking very minor [problems] compared with the depression of the early 1990s. … People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I’m excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.” (Globe and Mail interview)

April 2016: “You know a really good businessman, when the economy crashes and you’re in the middle of a big job, maybe it’s a building or a deal or a factory or something, right — the really good ones are the ones that can take a catastrophe and make it good. I’ve taken some deals that should be terrible and made 'em better than if the economy stayed strong. And the reason you lose it is sometimes the economy, and you know, who’s going to be blamed for the economy? The politicians, maybe. But the really good ones are the ones that can take a bad condition, and you go in and you beat up the banks.” (Campaign rally in Pittsburgh)

May 2016: On renegotiating debt: “And you know debt was always sort of interesting to me. Now we’re in a different situation with a country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good, so therefore you can’t lose.” (CNBC interview)

As president, Trump has understandably less interest in a downturn — given its implication for his reelection — but even he has suggested that it might be necessary for achieving larger goals. See his comments last month about his trade war with China:"

On July 21, Trump tweeted a boast about the state’s recent economic success:

""The Great State of West Virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well. When I became President, it was practically shut down and closed for business. Not anymore!""

Because the tweet’s vague phrasing is hard to measure mathematically, we won’t be rating the statement on the Truth-O-Meter. Instead, we will look at some key economic factors to get a rough sense of whether the state’s economic performance has turned on a dime since 2017, the year that both Trump and his ally, Gov. Jim Justice, took office.

Broadly speaking, we found that the state’s economic performance has improved during that period -- but for several key statistics, that improvement continued the ongoing trend lines in place before Trump and Justice took office. (Justice was elected governor as a Democrat, but he switched to the Republican Party in 2017.)

For instance, here’s a look at the state’s unemployment rate since 2007. As with the other charts below, the red portions denote the tenures of Trump and Justice.

West Virginia’s unemployment rate in August 2019 was 4.6%, the lowest since the start of the Great Recession, and it has fallen from 5.3% in January 2017, when Trump and Justice took office.

However, as the chart shows, the state unemployment rate also fell under President Barack Obama and Justice’s Democratic predecessor, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin. Indeed, the country’s unemployment rate as a whole has declined during that period, so this pattern was not unique to West Virginia.

We also looked at median household income in West Virginia:

This chart also shows good news for West Virginia -- modest gains above the rate of inflation in 2017 and 2018.

Here too, though, inflation-adjusted median income also rose in West Virginia in 2015 and 2016, before Trump or Justice took office. And the pattern in West Virginia was similar to what it was for the nation as a whole.

Here’s a look at food stamp use — one of the main statistics that measures the extent of poverty in the state and the nation.

The number of West Virginians on food stamps has declined since the start of 2017, which is positive news. However, the decline began several years before Trump and Justice took office, and it mirrors the pattern nationally.

Meanwhile, here’s a chart showing the change in quarterly gross domestic product for West Virginia. That’s a measure of all economic output in the state, compared to the previous quarter.

The quarterly GDP growth is good news, too, for West Virginia. In six quarters, the state saw an increase, compared to three quarters in which there was a decline. The quarterly increases ranged from about 2% to almost 10%.

That said, ""it’s hard to attribute economic growth to any president’s policies,"" said Eric Bowen, an energy economics specialist at West Virginia University. ""In the case of West Virginia’s economic growth, I think you would have to consider the trends prior to the changeover in administration.""

Perhaps the most striking improvement occurred in the labor-force participation rate. This is a statistic that calculates the percentage of West Virginia’s civilian, non-institutionalized population that is either working or looking for work. Economists say that a higher percentage is always preferable because it shows that a smaller share of the population is unable or unwilling to work.

Here’s a chart showing West Virginia’s labor force participation rate since 2007, about a year before the Great Recession hit.

The chart shows that prior to 2017, West Virginia’s labor-force participation rate was generally falling or stagnant. But since early 2017, it has risen consistently, even if not to pre-recession levels.

This improvement is especially notable since the labor force participation rate for the country as a whole has been stable even as West Virginia’s has been rising.

However, it’s worth noting that after rough stability in population in the first half of the decade, West Virginia’s population shrank by about 25,000 people between 2016 and 2018. So while employment did increase, the rise in the labor force participation rate was magnified by the shrinkage in population.

Having a shrinking population ""doesn't look so good for the economic outcomes in the state,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.

Finally, we looked at data for a specific industry that has been a key focus of policy attention for both Trump and Justice — mining and resource extraction. Both Trump and Justice have advocated easing environmental and regulatory restrictions on the mining and oil and gas sectors. West Virginia ranks near the top nationally in coal and is also a significant natural gas producer.

This chart shows the amount of economic output every quarter from mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction in the state:

The economic output has been on an upward trajectory since the start of 2017, though it also rose — somewhat more gradually — for several years prior.

However, it’s worth noting that the recent gains for the extraction sector are limited. Here’s a chart showing the number of employees in the extraction sector:

In other words, the sector has gained a few thousand jobs since its low point in 2016, but its current level remains far below its pre-recession level and even well below its peak in late 2011 and early 2012.

""For a variety of reasons — mostly due to low natural gas prices and a falloff in coal exports — the election year of 2016 was a particularly bad year for the state’s coal mining industry, and we have seen some rebound since then,"" Bowen said. ""But mining employment and production are still well below what they were as recently as 2011.""

The bottom line

Key economic statistics show that West Virginia is on an upward course. The most impressive turnaround since Trump and Justice entered office has been in the labor force participation rate.

Other statistics also show gains during their tenures, but in many cases those continued the trend lines seen under their predecessors, calling into question how much credit either can claim for the economic progress."
127,Half-million fewer jobs: Revisions hit Trump economy - NBC News,Half-million fewer jobs: Revisions hit Trump economy  NBC News,"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL21lZXQtdGhlLXByZXNzL2hhbGYtbWlsbGlvbi1mZXdlci1qb2JzLXJldmlzaW9ucy1oaXQtdHJ1bXAtZWNvbm9teS1uMTA0NjE1NtIBLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL25jbmExMDQ2MTU2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"WASHINGTON--Throughout Donald Trump’s turbulent presidency, the economy has served as a stabilizer. His economic approval numbers are consistently higher than his overall job approval in polls and he’s made his economic stewardship a top reelection talking point.

“You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes,” he told a crowd in New Hampshire earlier this month. “Whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me.”

But recent headlines and new sets of data are raising questions about exactly where the economy is heading as 2020 approaches. Increasingly it looks like the president’s stabilizer is headed for some bumpy times.

To start with, it appears some of the nation’s good economic times have not been as good as we thought they were.

New revised numbers this week from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job-creation estimates had been off by about 20 percent. The data showed that about 2 million jobs were created between April 2018 and March 2019. That is 500,000 fewer jobs than the estimates had originally shown.

That's not recession territory, of course — growth is growth — but it is not good. And there are similar patterns elsewhere in the numbers.

The numbers for Gross Domestic Product were also revised down earlier this year.

Another look at GDP earlier this summer from the Commerce Department, showed that U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent clip for 2018, rather than the 3.0 number that was first announced. That was a blow to the administration, which had celebrated the 3.0 number as a breakthrough not seen since 2005. The 2.5 number was lower than 2017’s 2.8 percent and also below annual figures for 2014 and 2013.

Estimates for future GDP growth are lower still. The 2019 estimate is currently at 2.3 percent growth, with the 2020 number at 2.1 percent, according to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office.

And this summer has brought fresh concerns about what’s coming.

The U.S. economy is largely being propelled by consumer spending and August saw a sharp dip in the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index compared to July.

The drop to 92.1 from 98.4 was largely driven by concerns about where the economy was headed, but that “clouds on the horizon” forecast has been driving a lot of the economic unease and not without reason. Some reliable measures for the economy’s future health have turned negative in recent weeks.

Maybe most concerning for the White House, on Thursday the Purchasing Manger’s Index of U.S. manufacturing slipped into contraction territory for the first time in almost a decade. The August measure, 44.9, is just a tick under the number 50, which shows no growth.

To be fair that’s a slim difference and that manufacturing number could bounce back in months to come, but the trend over the past few months is unmistakably down.

That drop is a special concern to team Trump because of who takes the hit on it. The president ran on a lot of ideas in 2016, but one of the boldest was a promise to reinvigorate manufacturing in the United States.

Manufacturing makes up a crucial part of the economies in the three states that ultimately won Trump the presidency: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And all those states have seen manufacturing employment declines over the last six months.

What's going on in all these numbers? Some of this may just be bumps in the road. Even good economic times aren’t uniformly good. The global economic slowdown may have something to do with the dips. The United States is not immune from larger global forces. And, of course, the president's trade disputes are likely playing a role.

Regardless of the reason, however, these numbers are going to be an important part of the 2020 landscape.

Economists and analysts will rightly note that the U.S. economy is still growing, but to some extent, that’s beside the point. Much of the economy is psychological. It's less about the numbers than how people feel about the numbers. After months and years of positive trends, an economic slowdown can feel like economic anxiety. That could present a challenge for the president in 2020.

Up to now the economy has been the bright spot that Trump could boast because most Americans seemed to feel pretty good about the economy. But these numbers suggest that picture wasn’t as sunny as we believed it was and it may be considerably more cloudy in the months ahead."

But that advantage disappears if the economy goes south.

And that might be the biggest news over the last 24 hours: The state of the U.S. economy feels a lot more fragile than the traditional indicators suggest (like the 3.7 percent unemployment rate).

“Shares on Wall Street were off sharply. ... The S&P 500 was down 2.9 percent. And bond markets offered an ominous warning on American growth prospects, with yields falling to levels not seen in years,” the New York Times writes.

Additionally, “The financial jitters, which continued Thursday as markets in Asia were down in early trading, came after new data showed the German economy hurtling toward a recession and factory output in China growing at its slowest pace in 17 years.”

And this morning’s developments aren’t any brighter.

“Global stocks fell after China vowed to take ‘necessary counter-measures’ over U.S. plans for a new tariff on Chinese imports, compounding investors’ concerns about weakness in the global economy,” the Wall Street Journal says.

Bottom line: Trump’s political standing is already in dangerous territory, despite a historically low unemployment rate and a growing economy.

What happens if that positive economic news goes away?

But there’s also a challenge for Democrats, especially when it comes to tariffs and trade.

Can you promise to get tough on China and oppose free-trade agreements when it appears that those strategies have backfired? (And how do you out-Trump Trump on trade?)

Or do you take a more pro-free trade approach, which is contrary to where the left and organized labor are on the issue?

There isn’t an easy answer here for Democrats.

Have to assume Trump is freaking out because neither he nor the Fed identifiably caused today’s stock drop and it’s unclear his usual tools will do anything about it. — Josh Barro (@jbarro) August 15, 2019

Trump heads to New Hampshire

The negative economic news is the backdrop to tonight’s Trump rally in Manchester, N.H. at 7:00 pm ET.

“The state, which he lost by about 2,700 votes in 2016, is doing well economically, at least when using broad measures,” per the AP.

“But beneath the top-line data are clear signs that the prosperity is being unevenly shared, and when the tumult of the Trump presidency is added to the mix, the state’s flinty voters may not be receptive to his appeals.”

By the way, Trump has been blaming the Federal Reserve for the economic jitters – because it raised interest rates and then didn’t lower them enough.

But we remember when Trump was against low interest rates during Obama’s presidency.

“The Fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation,” he tweeted back in 2011.

Beto’s back

Beto O’Rourke this morning will deliver a speech from El Paso, marking his return to the 2020 presidential campaign after the deadly shooting last week that killed 22 people in his hometown.

“O’Rourke will recommit to holding President Trump accountable for the state of the country — and focus on the stakes of removing a president from office whom he has explicitly linked to the deaths of fellow El Pasoans, according to a senior campaign official,” NBC’s Garrett Haake writes.

“He’ll focus heavily on three key issues: racism, white supremacy and guns — and plans to propose what the campaign calls ‘new, bold solutions.’”

The good news for Beto: His campaign has a new sense of urgency and it’s getting newfound attention after his handling of the El Paso tragedy.

The bad news: This is, by our count, Beto’s second relaunch/reset (his first being when he junked his local campaigning strategy for a more national one).

And successful campaigns usually don’t get two relaunches/resets.

2020 Vision: Hickenlooper exits the race

We told you August would be a month when the 2020 Democratic field would winnow due to the heightened requirements to make next month’s debate stage.

And it seems we have the first casualty of August.

“Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is expected to drop out of the Democratic presidential race on Thursday, a source close to Hickenlooper told NBC News on Wednesday night,” Stephanie Ruhle and Alex Johnson report.

It’s still unclear if Hickenlooper would make a run for Colorado’s Senate race, or if he’s getting out of politics altogether.

Elizabeth Warren brought out a comedic side to her campaign during a house party in New Hampshire, NBC’s Benjamin Pu reports: “As for the funny moments - why do I bring up the funny side of Warren’s campaigning style? I’ve had several voters tell me that Warren has better energy and charisma over Sen. Bernie Sanders, her policy contemporary. These two incidents I flagged above really killed with the crowd, and they were, as far as I can tell, unscripted.

One thing you can do is remind them that the word ‘well-regulated’ is in there too.""

Five.

That’s the number of times — before yesterday — that there has been an inversion of the yields on the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes since 1978.

From our colleagues at CNBC: “There have been five inversions of the 2-year and 10-year yields since 1978 and all were precursors to a recession, but there is a significant lag, according to data from Credit Suisse. A recession occurred, on average, 22 months after the inversion, Credit Suisse shows. And the S&P 500 actually enjoyed average returns of 15 percent 18 months after an inversion before it eventually turns.”

Since President Donald Trump took office:

The economy added 6 million jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in nearly 50 years.

Economic growth fell far short of the annual 4% to 6% Trump promised. The most recent rate is 2.0%.

The federal debt went up more than $2.4 trillion. The annual deficit hit nearly $1 trillion in fiscal year 2019 – the highest since 2012.

Median household income rose 2.3%. Average weekly paychecks rose 2.8%. The poverty rate and food stamp rolls declined.

Average weekly paychecks rose 2.8%. The poverty rate and food stamp rolls declined. Stock prices rose: The S&P 500 index was up 29.8%. Single-family home prices rose nearly 23%, hitting a record level in June.

The trade deficit — which Trump promised to reduce — went up 30%.

The number of Americans lacking health insurance rose nearly 2 million.

The number of murders dropped 6.9%. But the number of rapes went up.

Illegal border crossings nearly doubled, as of the most recent 12 months on record.

Trump has filled 43 seats on federal appeals courts, compared with 25 filled by Obama at the same point in his first term.

Analysis

This is our seventh quarterly update of the “Trump’s Numbers” scorecard that we posted in January 2018 and have updated every three months, most recently on July 12. We’ll publish additional updates every three months, as fresh statistics become available.

Here we’ve included statistics that may seem good or bad or just neutral, depending on the reader’s point of view. That’s the way we did it when we posted our first “Obama’s Numbers” article seven years ago — and in the quarterly updates and final summary that followed. And we’ve maintained the same practice under Trump.

This update includes comprehensive looks at crime, income and poverty during the president’s first two years in office. The FBI’s report of crime rates for all of 2018 was released Sept. 30, and the Census Bureau’s figures for median annual household income, poverty levels and health insurance coverage during 2018 were released Sept. 10. Other statistics are released quarterly, monthly and sometimes daily, and we include here the most recent available as of this date.

Then as now, we make no judgment as to how much credit or blame any president deserves for things that happen during his time in office. Opinions differ on that.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed a bit under Trump, but unemployment dropped to the lowest level in nearly half a century.

Employment — Total nonfarm employment grew by 6,027,000 since the president took office, according to the most recent figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That continued an unbroken chain of monthly gains in total employment that started in October 2010. The economy has now added jobs for 108 consecutive months — just shy of nine years — including the first 32 months of the Trump administration.

The average monthly gain under Trump so far is 188,000 — compared with an average monthly gain of 217,000 during Obama’s second term. Trump is far behind the pace needed to fulfill his campaign boast that he will be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.”

Unemployment — The unemployment rate, which was well below the historical norm when Trump took office, has continued to fall to the lowest rate in nearly half a century.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics now figures the rate was 4.7% when he was sworn in. The most recent rate, for September, fell to 3.5%. That’s the lowest since December 1969, nearly 50 years ago, when it was also 3.5%.

The jobless rate has been at or below 4% for the most recent 19 months — all under Trump. It hasn’t been that low for that long since a 50-month streak ending in January 1970.

The historical norm is 5.6%, which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948.

Job Openings — One reason employment growth has slowed is a shortage of qualified workers.

The number of unfilled job openings hit more than 7.6 million in November and again in January, the highest in the 18 years the BLS has tracked this figure.

As of the last day of August, the most recent figure on record, it was nearly 7.1 million. That’s a gain of 1.4 million unfilled job openings — or 25.4% — since Trump took office.

In March of last year the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people looking for work for the first time on record. And that’s been the case in every month since. In August, there were 1 million more job openings than there were people seeking jobs.

Labor Force Participation — Despite the abundance of jobs, the labor force participation rate — which went down 2.8 percentage points during the Obama years — is up slightly under Trump.

The labor force participation rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks. Republicans often criticized Obama for the decline during his time, even though it was due mostly to the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age, and other demographic factors beyond the control of any president.

Since Trump took office, the rate has fluctuated in a narrow range between 63.2% and 62.7%. It was at the high end of that range in September — 0.3 percentage points above where it was the month Trump took office.

Manufacturing Jobs — Manufacturing jobs increased under Trump, but the growth has stalled recently.

The number rose by 482,000 between Trump’s inauguration and September. That followed a net decrease of 193,000 under Obama.

But the early growth during Trump’s term has faded. At first, manufacturing jobs increased even faster than total employment. But Trump’s trade disputes and tariffs have taken a toll on the manufacturing sector. During the first nine months of this year, the number of factory jobs rose 0.2%, while total employment rose four times as fast.

During all of Trump’s tenure, the grown in manufacturing jobs has been 3.9%, below the 4.1% growth for all jobs.

The number of manufacturing jobs is still 896,000 below where it was in December 2007, at the start of the Great Recession.

Economic Growth

The economy grew somewhat faster under Trump — but not at the rate he promised. Gross domestic product was growing at an annual rate of 2.0% during the second quarter of this year, after going up 2.9% in 2018 and a revised 2.4% during his first year in office.

Since our last report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis has upwardly revised its estimate of growth in 2017 by 0.2 percentage points as part of its annual update, using newly available data to refine its GDP estimates for the previous five years. Even so, growth under Trump has averaged far less than the 4% to 6% per year that he promised repeatedly, both when he was a candidate and also as president. And economists say future growth rates will be nowhere close to what Trump once claimed he could bring about.

There’s little reason to think growth will improve. The “GDPNow” forecast produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projects that the third-quarter growth rate will come in at 1.7% based on several economic indicators that are already known.

Most economists believe this year’s growth will be less than last year’s. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s most recent economic outlook, issued Aug. 21, projects year-to-year growth of real GDP at 2.6% this year and 2.1% next year (see page 40).

A more recent median forecast of the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, issued Sept. 18, projects 2.2% growth this year and 2.0% in 2020 (measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, rather than from year to year). That’s similar to the GDP forecasts offered by business and university economists to the Wall Street Journal’s monthly economic survey in September. Their average prediction was for only 2.2% annual growth this year and 1.7% next year.

The National Association for Business Economics’ October survey produced a median forecast of 2.3% year-to-year growth in 2019, and 1.8% in 2020.

Income and Poverty

Household Income — Household income rose briskly under Trump.

The Census Bureau’s measure of median household income reached $63,179, an increase of $1,400 from 2016 after adjusting for inflation.

In percentage terms, the increase during Trump’s first two years is 2.3%. (The median figure represents the midpoint — half of all households earned more, half less.)

The official figure is the highest ever recorded, exceeding previous records set in 2016 and 2017. But Census officials said those recent “records” are all due in part to a change in the survey questions in 2014. Starting then, the annual survey has picked up some sources of income that were previously missed.

Adjusting for that factor, and also for a change in the way Census processed data starting this year, Census officials published “estimated adjusted” figures showing what median household income would have been for past years, had the current questionnaire and processing procedures been in place. On that basis the latest figure is just a few dollars less than it was in 1999 — $63,231.

The “estimated adjusted” figures also show an even greater increase during Trump’s first two years than the official figures, because this year’s new data processing procedures had the effect of holding down income by a fraction of a percentage point. On an adjusted basis, the increase under Trump would be $1,638, or 2.7%.

Poverty — As incomes rose, the rate of poverty declined. The percentage of Americans living with income below the official poverty line went down to 11.8% of the population in 2018, the lowest level since 2001.

The poverty rate has now declined for four consecutive years, dropping by 1.3 percentage points in 2015, by 0.8 points in 2016 and by 0.4 points and 0.5 points in Trump’s first two years.

Regulations

The growth of federal regulation has stopped under Trump.

It wasn’t exactly the “sudden, screeching and beautiful halt” Trump prematurely claimed back in December 2017, when in fact the number of federal restrictions was still growing. But over the next several months the rise decelerated, and then reversed. The number of restrictions has now dropped to just below where it was when Trump was sworn in.

The number of restrictive words and phrases (such as “shall,” “prohibited” or “may not”) contained in the Code of Federal Regulations went up by 0.73% within Trump’s first 15 months, reaching a peak of nearly 1.09 million on April 6, 2018, according to daily tracking done by the QuantGov project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.

But as of Oct. 10, 2019, the number had dropped back below 1.08 million — 2,789 fewer than on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Trump took office.

In percentage terms, the drop is only 0.26% — barely one-quarter of 1 percentage point. But that’s a big change from the past. Restrictions grew at an average of 1.5% per year during both the Obama years and the George W. Bush years, according to annual QuantGov tracking.

The Mercatus count of restrictions doesn’t attempt to assess the cost or benefit of any particular rule — such assessments require a degree of guesswork and are sensitive to assumptions. But it does track the sheer volume of federal rules with more precision than we have found in other metrics.

Some of the recent changes are just clearing deadwood. In March, for example, the Internal Revenue Service removed 296 regulations that it said “are no longer necessary because they do not have any current or future applicability.” And last year the Treasury Department scrapped an entire chapter of zombie-like regulations issued by the old Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversaw the savings-and-loan industry before being abolished in 2011. S&Ls have since fallen under other federal banking regulators, but the obsolete OTS rules remained on the books.

However, many of the rules Trump has eliminated are quite significant.

Within a month of taking office, for example, Trump signed a law nullifying an Obama-era rule restricting coal mining companies from dumping waste into streams and waterways. Last year his administration proposed withdrawing Obama’s edict requiring automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of new cars and light trucks to 46.8 miles per gallon by the year 2025. Instead, the requirement would be capped at the 2020 level of 37 mpg. And in September the EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy rule took effect, repealing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan rule. The Obama-era rule was designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by shifting away from coal as an energy source and would have required states to meet specific emissions reductions.

Crime

Crime declined during Trump’s first two years, except for rape, which increased.

The FBI’s annual Crime in the United States report, released Sept. 30, shows 1,199 fewer murders were committed in 2018 than in 2016, when Trump was elected. That’s a decline of 6.9%.

But despite that decline, the murder rate per 100,000 people, which was 5.0 last year, still was above the record low set in 2014, when it was 4.4.

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly claimed that the murder rate was “the highest it’s been in 45 years.” That was far from true. The rate did rise during President Obama’s final two years, to 5.4 per 100,000 in 2016. But the highest rate in the past half century was 10.2 in 1980.

Overall, the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 people went down 4.6% during Trump’s first two years. That included a 16.2% drop in the robbery rate, and a 0.6% decline in the rate of aggravated assault.

However, the number of reported rapes per 100,000 people went up — by 4.2%. (A rise in rapes and sexual assault in 2018 was also noted in the National Crime Victimization Survey, released Sept. 10, which covers crimes that are not reported to police, as well as those that are.)

The number of property crimes per 100,000 people went down 10.3% during Trump’s first two years, including a 19.8% drop in the burglary rate, an 8.6% drop in the rate of larcenies (such as shoplifting), and a 3.5% decline in the rate of motor vehicle thefts.

Guns

Sales and production of guns pulled back under Trump, after surging to record levels during the Obama years.

Handgun Production — In 2018, annual production of pistols and revolvers in the U.S. totaled just under 4.3 million, according to preliminary figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, released July 22.

That represented a decline of 23% from 2016, when production surged to a record level of nearly 5.6 million.

Handgun production more than tripled during the Obama years. So the 2018 level was still 135% higher than it had been in 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency.

Gun Sales — Gun sales also dropped — though the decline seems to have leveled off this year.

The government doesn’t collect figures on sales of guns. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the gun industry’s trade group — tracks approximate sales figures by adjusting FBI statistics on background checks to remove those not related to actual sales, such as checks required for concealed-carry permits.

Those NSSF-adjusted figures dropped from a record 15.7 million in Obama’s final year to 13.1 million last year — a decrease of 16.5%.

Sales for this year have been mixed. They dropped further during the first half of the year but bounced back during the July-September quarter. The NSSF figures for the first six months of 2019 were 5.3% lower than for the same period in 2018. But the third-quarter figures were 9.1% higher than the year-earlier figures.

Overall, figures for the first nine months of 2019 were a scant 1.1% below the same period in 2018.

These figures cover rifles and shotguns and previously owned weapons, as well as new handguns. They are only an approximation of actual sales, since some of these checks cover purchases of multiple weapons, and of course some sales still occur without background checks.

Coal and Environment

Coal Mining Jobs — As a candidate, Trump promised to “put our [coal] miners back to work,” but so far not many have regained their jobs.

A total of 35,600 coal mining jobs disappeared during the Obama years, but as of September, only 2,500 of them had come back since Trump took office, according to BLS figures.

The outlook for coal miners remains bleak. The Energy Information Administration reports that U.S. consumption of coal reached a 39-year low last year. And EIA predicts that will fall another 10% this year, and 11% more in 2020. EIA expects natural gas will continue to displace coal for the generation of electricity.

Carbon Emissions — Carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption have gone up under Trump, after falling for years before he took office.

Figures from the Energy Information Administration show CO2 emissions were 0.9% higher in the most recent 12 months on record (ending in June) than they were in 2016.

In the decade before Trump took office, emissions fell by a total of 14.5%, due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal-fired plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, as well as solar and wind power. Under Trump, the trend first slowed — emissions fell only 0.8% in 2017 — and then reversed entirely — rising 2.7% in 2018.

The 2018 rise is turning out to be a temporary blip — brought on by a hotter summer and colder winter than normal, resulting in higher natural gas consumption. EIA is currently predicting that CO2 emissions will fall by 2.4% in 2019 — if temperatures return to normal as forecast. But so far, there has been a net gain in total carbon emissions since Trump took office.

Border Security

Illegal border crossings surged under Trump, to the highest levels in well over a decade, but have dropped considerably in recent months.

In May, 132,859 people were apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without permission, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That was the highest total since March 2006, when the monthly total hit nearly 161,000.

But monthly apprehensions fell in each of the next three months, totaling 50,693 in August.

That still leaves the average monthly total for this year at 82,176. That is higher than the monthly average for any full year since 2006, when it hit 84,800.

For the most recent 12 months on record, the monthly average was 71,042 which is 92.5% higher than the monthly average of 36,912 in 2016. We use this rolling monthly average for our chart, because these monthly figures are subject to wide seasonal variations.

Of those apprehended in August, 43% were single adults. The rest, nearly 57%, were either unaccompanied children or part of “family units” made up of a child under 18 accompanied by a parent or guardian. Border Patrol officials said they are coming primarily from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and many are seeking asylum. It’s a big change from the days when most such attempted border crossings were made by Mexican males seeking work.

Corporate Profits

After-tax corporate profits are running at near record levels under Trump. During 2018, they hit $1.84 trillion for the year, just under the record $1.86 trillion recorded for 2014. During the second quarter of 2019, profits still were running at a yearly rate of $1.86 trillion.

Since our last report — when we said profits in 2018 set a record $1.95 trillion — the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its annual and quarterly estimates of after-tax profits (on line 45) as part of its annual update, using newly available data to refine its estimates for the previous five years. The 2018 figure was revised downward.

Still, the most recent quarter’s annual rate is 6.9% higher than the full-year figure for 2016, the year before Trump’s inauguration.

Stock Market

Stock prices continued their decade-long rise with Trump in office — but seem to have hit a ceiling since our last report.

Market indexes set record after record in 2018, only to plunge during the worst December since 1931 and then bounce back during the best first quarter in a decade, and go on to set new records in July, as we reported in our last update.

Stock prices have slipped downward a bit since then. But even so, at the close on Oct. 10, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average was 29.8% higher than it was on the last trading day before Trump’s inauguration.

Other indexes took similar rides. At the Oct. 10 close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 34.3% under Trump. And the NASDAQ composite index, made up of more than 3,000 companies, closed on Oct. 10 at 43.5% higher than before Trump took office.

The bull market began its rise in the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, and became the longest in history last year. This year it passed its 10th anniversary in March.

Wages and Inflation

The upward trend in real wages continued under Trump, and inflation remained in check.

CPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 5.2% during Trump’s first 32 months, continuing a long period of historically low inflation.

In the most recent 12 months, ending in September, the CPI rose 1.7%. The CPI rose an average of 1.8% each year of the Obama presidency (measured as the 12-month change ending each January), and an average of 2.4% during each of George W. Bush’s years.

Wages — Paychecks continued to grow faster than prices.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 2.8% during Trump’s first 32 months (ending in September) after going up 3.9% during the previous four years.

Those figures are for all private-sector workers, including managers and supervisors.

For rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers (who make up 82% of all private-sector workers), real weekly earnings have gone up 3.2% so far under Trump, after rising 4.9% during Obama’s last four years in office.

Consumer Sentiment

Consumer confidence in the economy first rose, then sagged under Trump.

The University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers monthly index peaked at 101.4 in March of last year, which was the highest in 14 years. Since then it has gone down to 93.2 as of September — a decline of 5.3 points since Trump took office.

However, the most recent index is still 6.0 points above where it was in October 2016 — just before Trump was elected — after promising to boost economic growth to levels not seen in decades.

Home Prices and Ownership

Home Prices — Home prices soared to record levels under Trump.

Since our last report, the national median price of an existing, single-family home set another record, peaking at $288,500 in June, according to sales figures from the National Association of Realtors.

Lately prices have moderated a bit, but still stood at $280,700 in August, the most recent monthly figure available. That is $52,000 higher than the median price of $228,700 for homes sold during the month Trump took office — a gain in value of 22.7%. The rise in the Consumer Price Index during the same period was 5.1%.

The Realtors’ figures reflect raw sales prices without attempting to adjust for such factors as variations in the size, location, age or condition of the homes sold in a given month or year. Even so, a similar pattern emerges from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which compares sales prices of similar homes and seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing single-family housing stock.

The Case-Shiller index for July sales (the most recent available) was 14.6% above where it stood in the month Trump took office.

Whichever way you measure it, homeowners have seen the value of their houses rise substantially since Trump became president.

Homeownership — The percentage of Americans who own their homes at first continued to recover under Trump, but lately has taken a dip.

Back in 2004 the homeownership rate hit a record 69.2% of households for two quarters, but then began a years-long slide, hitting bottom in the second quarter of 2016 at 62.9%. That was the lowest point in more than half a century, and tied for the lowest on record.

The rate recovered 0.8 points in the six months before Trump took office, and went up another 1.1 points during his first two years, reaching 64.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018.

But most of that gain under Trump was erased in the first half of this year, according to the most recent Census Bureau figures.

The most recent rate, for the second quarter of 2019, stands at 64.1%. That’s 0.4 percentage point higher than the quarter before Trump took office, but still a full 5 points below the peak level of 15 years earlier.

Trade

The trade deficit that Trump promised to reduce grew much larger instead.

The most recent government figures show that the total U.S. trade deficit in goods and services during the most recent 12 months on record (ending in August) was $656 billion. That’s an increase of $153 billion, or 30.4%, compared with 2016.

China — The goods-and-services trade deficit with China grew at a somewhat slower pace, up by 17.2% between 2016 and the most recent 12 months on record (ending in June) when it hit $362 billion.

Trump last year initiated a full-scale trade conflict with China, imposing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. China has retaliated with its own tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods. Trump met personally with Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 29 in Osaka, Japan, but it remains to be seen how the trade war will be resolved, and what effect that might have on future trade.

Mexico — Meanwhile, the much smaller trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico totaled $92 billion during the 12 months ending in June, an increase of 49% compared with 2016.

Canada — The trade surplus that the U.S. runs with Canada has dwindled to nearly nothing under Trump. The trade balance was positive by $697 million during the 12 months ending in June. That surplus has shrunk by 90.6% since 2016.

On Nov. 30 last year Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico signed a new trade agreement to replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump had promised to scrap during his campaign. The new agreement will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. The new agreement still requires approval by Congress before it can take effect. But Democrats who control the House want stronger enforcement for labor and environmental standards, and changes in patent protections for drug companies, and have not allowed a vote on the measure.

Health Insurance Coverage

The number of people lacking health insurance rose by nearly 2 million under Trump.

The U.S. Census Bureau reported Sept. 10 that the number of Americans who lacked health insurance for all of 2018 was 27.5 million — up from 25.6 million in 2017. It was the first time in a decade that this number increased. The percentage of Americans without coverage for the entire year rose to 8.5%, from 7.9% the year before.

The Census report confirmed a trend we’ve been tracking using a somewhat different measure released on a more frequent and timely basis by the National Health Interview Survey. As we reported in our July update, the NHIS put the number of people who lacked coverage at the time they were interviewed — not necessarily for the entire year — at 30.4 million in 2018, an increase of 1.8 million over 2016.

The NHIS said 9.4% of the population lacked coverage at the time of interview in 2018, up from 9% in 2016.

A much greater rise was reported by a Gallup survey covering the final quarter of 2018. Gallup on Jan. 23 put the rise in uninsured adults at about 7 million, compared with the last half of 2016. Gallup put the percentage of uninsured adults at 13.7% in the October-December quarter. For details, see our Feb. 12 story, “Did the Uninsured Increase by 7 Million?“

Trump failed to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act as he promised to do, but did slash advertising and outreach aimed at enrolling people in Obamacare plans. In December 2017 he signed a tax bill that ended the ACA’s tax penalty for people who fail to obtain coverage, effective this year. And in March the Trump administration joined an effort by GOP state attorneys general seeking a court decision to overturn the entire act. That case, Texas v. U.S., was argued July 9 before the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans. The court has not yet issued its ruling in that case.

Food Stamps

The number of food stamp recipients dropped to the lowest levels in a decade.

Earlier this year the number dropped below 37 million for the first time since October 2009, when millions were signing up for benefits in the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

As of July, the most recent month for which figures are available, 36.3 million people were receiving the aid.

The number of food stamp recipients has gone down 6.4 million, or 15.1%, since January 2017, when Trump took office.

The number of recipients is now 11.5 million below the peak month of December 2012. But it is still 8.9 million above where it was at the start of the Great Recession, in December 2007, despite years of an improving economy.

The administration is working to reduce the number further. A proposed rule to tighten work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents would cause 755,000 individuals to lose eligibility, if and when it is implemented, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.

And in July, the Trump administration proposed another rule that it said could remove another 3 million people from the rolls. That rule would take away flexibility that many states now use to grant food aid to people with income or assets exceeding federal limits.

Judiciary Appointments

Trump is putting his mark on the federal appeals courts more quickly than Obama was able to do in his time in office.

Supreme Court — So far Trump has won Senate confirmation for two Supreme Court nominees, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

Obama also was able to fill two high court vacancies during his first two years in office, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan. But the Kavanaugh nomination to fill the vacancy created by Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement is significant because Kavanaugh may move the court to the right. He is considered to be more conservative than Kennedy, who sometimes sided with the liberal justices to provide deciding votes on issues including gay rights, abortion, capital punishment and affirmative action.

However, Kavanaugh disappointed abortion foes when he sided with the court’s liberals on one of his first votes, against taking up a case about whether citizens should be allowed to sue states that cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood health clinics.

Court of Appeals — Trump also won confirmation of 43 U.S. Court of Appeals judges (30 during his first two years and another 13 in the current Congress as of Oct. 7). That’s nearly double the total for Obama, who won confirmation for 25 as of the same point in his first term (16 during his first two years and nine more in the 112th Congress as of Oct 11, 2011).

Trump has now installed 24% of all the 179 appellate court judges authorized by federal law.

District Court — Trump also outpaced Obama on filling lower courts. Trump has won confirmation for 105 of his nominees to be federal District Court judges as of Oct. 7. That’s nearly 16% of the 677 authorized district judges. Obama had won confirmation for 87 at the same point in his presidency.

Trump has also filled two seats on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which has nationwide jurisdiction over lawsuits seeking money from the government. And he has filled two seats on the U.S. Court for International Trade. Obama had filled none at the same point in his first term.

Trump must share responsibility for this record with the Republican majority in the Senate. Republicans not only refused to consider Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy eventually filled by Gorsuch, but they also blocked confirmation of dozens of Obama’s nominees to lower courts. Trump inherited 17 Court of Appeals vacancies, for example, including seven that had Obama nominees pending but never confirmed.

Federal Debt and Deficits

The federal debt went up more than $2 trillion under Trump, as trillion-dollar annual federal deficits returned. And there’s no end in sight.

The federal debt held by the public stood at $16.8 trillion at the last count on Oct. 9 — an increase of more than $2.4 trillion since he took office. That’s a 16.7% increase under Trump. And that figure will go up even more quickly in coming years unless Trump and Congress impose massive spending cuts, or reverse course and increase taxes.

Trump’s cuts in corporate and individual income tax rates — as well as the bipartisan spending deal he signed Feb. 9, 2018 — are causing the red ink to gush even faster than it did before.

The federal government’s annual deficit hit $779 billion in fiscal year 2018. CBO estimates that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 (which ended Sept. 30) was $984 billion, based on daily Treasury statements. (The Treasury Department will issue the final, official figure later this month.)

That’s 2.5% higher than CBO estimated as recently as Aug. 21, in its latest update of its Budget and Economic Outlook, when it projected a FY2019 deficit of $960 billion. In that report, CBO said that under current law annual deficits will top $1 trillion in the fiscal year that just started, and average $1.2 trillion each year from 2020 through 2029.

The debt is now equal to about 78% of the nation’s entire gross domestic product. CBO said Oct. 3 that if current laws aren’t changed, the debt “would approach 100 percent of GDP by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.” That would be far higher than the debt the U.S. ran up during World War II, which was the highest in the nation’s history."
131,New poll has bad news for Trump. Voters think the economy is getting worse - CBS News,New poll has bad news for Trump. Voters think the economy is getting worse  CBS News,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3LXBvbGwtaGFzLWJhZC1uZXdzLWZvci10cnVtcC12b3RlcnMtdGhpbmstdGhlLWVjb25vbXktaXMtZ2V0dGluZy13b3JzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CBS News,"Trump says country will face economic losses if he is not reelected

President Trump's strongest case for reelection is arguably the economy — he says so himself. But that argument might be slipping with voters, according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll.

For the first time since Mr. Trump won the presidency in 2016, more registered voters say the country's economy is getting worse than say it's getting better. Voters still think the economy is good, but of those polled, 37% say the economy is getting worse, compared with 31% who say it's getting better and 30% who say it's staying the same. Just two months earlier in June, 23% of voters Quinnipiac surveyed said the economy was getting worse.

""As trade tensions with China dominate the headlines, confidence in the economy is slipping,"" Quinnipiac University Polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement. ""The number of people who think the economy is getting worse rose by double digits since June. And roughly four in 10 voters blame the President's policies, saying they are hurting the economy, the highest level since Trump took office.""

A CBS News poll released this week, however, indicated Americans are generally optimistic about the economy in the future. The poll found that 38% of Americans — who are not necessarily registered voters — are optimistic about the economy, 35% are pessimistic and 27% are not sure.

Volatile stalks, an inverted yield curve and uncertainties over the president's trade war with China have a number of economists concerned a recession could hit in the next two years.

The president typically lists economic gains as his top accomplishment, and the state of the economy is highlighted frequently in administration and campaign talking points. But if voters don't see the world the same way, that message could be undermined.

""I won the election, the markets went up thousands of points, things started happening,"" Mr. Trump said at a New Hampshire rally earlier this month. ""If, for some reason, I were not to have won the election, these markets would have crashed. That will happen even more so in 2020. You have no choice but to vote for me, because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes.""

If there is no recession, and voters continue to think the economy is good, even if people think the economy is heading in the wrong direction, that's probably good enough for the president's prospects, said GOP strategist Ford O'Connell.

""Since FDR, every incumbent president who has avoided a recession has been reelected,"" O'Connell told CBS News.

Most economist don't think there will be a recession before next year's presidential election, although more economists think a recession may be likely in 2021.

Democrats, O'Connell said, are going ""full-court press"" to convince voters that the economy is heading for a recession. The White House and Trump campaign will continue emphasizing the message that the economy is strong — and would worsen exponentially under a Democrat, O'Connell said."

The CBS News Poll also asked the public to weigh in on some anniversaries marking seminal events in America's history.

Here's some of what we found:

January: The government shutdown and border wall debate continue

2019 began where 2018 left off, with a federal government shutdown. Congress could not agree on a spending bill to fund the federal government so it was partially shut down. The issue at the center of the debate was money Mr. Trump wanted for a border wall. Seven in 10 Americans didn't think the issue of a border wall was worth a government shutdown. Much of the partisan divisions we've seen in recent years persisted. Most Democrats didn't think wall funding was worth a shutdown, but Republicans — most of whom support a border wall — felt it was.

Despite the shutdown, the public was feeling good about the economy — 68% said it was in good shape.

February: Another Trump-Kim summit, and the public splits on the NFL and national anthem

Congress approved a short-term spending bill to reopen the government and, in February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency to appropriate money to build a border wall. Most in the president's own party supported this action, but 66% of the public overall opposed it.

The month began with talk of another possible summit between Mr. Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un (a summit did take place later in the month). Few Americans believed North Korea had reduced its nuclear program, and a majority didn't think another summit should happen. Republicans supported another summit, although most of them also felt North Korea had not changed its nuclear program since the last summit.

From the international arena to the football arena, the controversy surrounding the NFL and the national anthem continued, dividing the public. Half said the league should require players to stand for the national anthem, but another half said the NFL should allow players to either stand or kneel during the anthem as they choose. Opinions differed little between football fans and non-fans, but there was a stark divide along racial and political lines: Most Republicans (86%) and whites (58%) said players should be required to stand, while most Democrats (76%) and African Americans (76%) felt they should be permitted to either stand or kneel.

March: Mueller submits report, and most say they've fantasized about quitting their jobs

In March, Attorney General William Barr released a four-page letter to Congress highlighting the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation. Partisan splits that had long marked the investigation remained after the letter was released: Most Republicans said the report had cleared Mr. Trump, while most Democrats were unconvinced and thought Congress should continue to pursue the matter. A majority of the public (77%) supported the release of the full Mueller report. There was agreement across party lines on that.

Have you ever fantasized about quitting your job? Most U.S. adults who work full time said they have: 56% have done so at least every once in a while, including 14% who said they fantasize about quitting their job all the time. If they did quit, travel tops the list as the thing people would most like to do with their free time, outranking spending more time with their friends and family.

April: A new high for legal pot

The CBS News Poll measures the public's views on legal marijuana at least once a year. And support for legal pot hit a new high in 2019, with 65% of U.S. adults saying marijuana should be legal.

For the first time in CBS News polling, a majority of Republicans (56%) favored legal marijuana. And while those ages 65 and over continued to be the least likely age group to support marijuana legalization, slightly more of them favored it (49%) than opposed it (45%) in this poll.

May: Majority supports keeping Roe v. Wade, and Trump gets some credit for a good economy

Recent state laws restricting access to abortion had prompted speculation over whether the Supreme Court might revisit Roe v. Wade. Two-thirds of Americans said Roe v. Wade should be left in place, and most who hold that view said they would be disappointed or angry if the ruling were to be overturned.

While most Republicans want stricter limits on abortion or to ban it outright, they were split over whether Roe v. Wade specifically ought to be overturned: 48% said it should be, but 45% said it should stay in place.

A majority of Americans remained confident about the U.S. economy and most gave Mr. Trump's policies at least partial credit for good economic conditions.

Two years after the launch of the Russia investigation, most Americans said they had heard enough about the Mueller report. And more than half said congressional Democrats should drop the Russia matter and move on to other issues. Most Democrats wanted Congress to keep investigating, however.

June: The 2020 CBS News Battleground Tracker debuts, and the 50-year anniversary of Stonewall

On June 16, CBS News released its first Battleground Tracker of the 2020 campaign. It looked at the Democratic race for president across the 18 states holding primaries and caucuses from Iowa through Super Tuesday. CBS News converted Democrats' vote choices into delegates — the count that will ultimately matter.

The belief that he could fare best against the president propelled Joe Biden to the top spot in both vote share and delegate estimate for the Democratic nomination.

Candidates receiving 1% or less in the poll are not pictured.

This June marked 50 years since the Stonewall uprising, the 1969 demonstrations by members of the gay community in New York City's Greenwich Village in support of gay rights. Most Americans said they've seen progress in ending discrimination against gays and lesbians. Sixty-seven percent support legalized same-sex marriage, a record high in CBS News polls. Attitudes may have changed and progress made, but a majority said at least some gay and lesbian discrimination still exists, including 44% who said a lot remains. More — 56% — said there is a lot of discrimination against people who are transgender.

July: Moon landing turns 50, and the public weighs in on Trump's ""go back"" tweets

In July, the country celebrated the 50th anniversary of the historic moon landing. Most Americans said the moon landing was worth it and want the U.S. to go back. There is even greater support for sending astronauts to Mars. And some want to take a trip to the moon themselves — 31% of Americans would like to. More are interested now than the 13% that was recorded by Gallup a few years before the first moon landing, when it hadn't yet been accomplished.

Things got pretty heated this summer when the president fired off a tweet telling four congresswomen of color to ""go back"" to the countries they came from. Most Americans (59%) disagreed with what the president said in his tweets, but 40% of the country agreed with it, including eight in 10 Republicans.

Three in four black Americans described the ideas expressed in the president's tweets as racist, while whites were divided.

August: Good marks on the economy for Trump, but skepticism about trade policy with China

In August, the CBS News Poll measured the public's views on the president and the economy, trade policy and on their own finances.

More gave Mr. Trump positive ratings on his handling of the economy in general than on his trade policy with China.

There was some public skepticism about whether the president's approach to trade with China will be successful. Only a quarter believed it would be. By year's end, the administration announced the U.S. and China had reached an agreement on ""phase one"" of a trade deal.

Some once protested against the British over a tax on tea, but today, Americans have a preference for coffee. In a head to head matchup between the two hot beverages, 47% said they most often drink coffee, while 40% picked tea. While most men said they drank coffee more often, women have a preference for tea.

September: Health care, mental health, climate change and impeachment

Health care is a top concern for most Americans and it will be a key issue in the 2020 race for president. Most favor some type of national health insurance plan, but they like their own health insurance and don't want private insurance to be replaced entirely with a public plan. Keeping costs down is a priority over making sure everyone has health care coverage. And many — more than four in 10 — find affording basic medical care a hardship.

The CBS News Poll dove into the topic of mental health for a special broadcast of ""CBS This Morning"" called ""Stop the Stigma: A Conversation about Mental Health."" Two in three Americans said mental illness is a very serious public health problem. It's also an issue that is personal for most: A majority have said they personally know someone who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder.

Climate change is another pressing issue for the public. In a September poll, 56% of U.S. adults said action needs to be taken right now to address it. Opinions on climate change divide along partisan lines, with most Democrats saying humans contribute a lot to climate change and that people need to act now, and Republicans more skeptical about the degree to which humans are involved and the urgency of the issue. This poll on climate was released as part of Covering Climate Now, a collaboration of more than 250 news outlets around the world providing in-depth coverage of the climate story.

Soon after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would move ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, the CBS News Poll took its first measure on the matter. More than half of Americans approved of opening the inquiry, but there was more division over whether he actually deserved to be impeached over his actions regarding Ukraine. Views remained similarly divided throughout the impeachment process.

October: Warren extends lead across early states, and partisans dig in on impeachment

October's CBS News Battleground Tracker had some good news in it for Elizabeth Warren. She extended her aggregate lead across the 18 early primary and caucus states. Democratic voters viewed Warren as better able than Biden to handle any attacks from Mr. Trump in 2020.

Warren and Bernie Sanders were more likely than Biden to be seen as someone who will ""fight"" a great deal for people like them. Biden still had the advantage on electability, which continues to be a top priority for Democratic voters.

On impeachment, most said the Trump administration should cooperate with the inquiry, although a majority of Republicans disagreed. Partisans became more hardened in their views on impeachment.

November: Buttigieg picks up steam in Iowa and New Hampshire

Democratic voters' first choice for the nomination across the 18 early primary and caucus states continued to swing back and forth between Biden and Warren (followed by Bernie Sanders), with neither breaking away.

Candidates receiving 1% or less in the poll are not pictured.

But it was Pete Buttigieg who made gains in the states of Iowa and New Hampshire. His support in Iowa had tripled since September. And Warren, who was atop the list with Biden the month before, had dropped a bit.

Some Democrats expressed concern that Sanders and Warren's policy stances could be too liberal for either of them to beat Mr. Trump in November 2020. Fewer said that about Buttigieg's and Biden's policy positions.

In November, with Election Day a year away, Democratic voters had not grown any more confident that their party's eventual nominee would beat the president. While most said they were at least somewhat confident, just 26% were very confident, a percentage that had barely budged since the summer.

December: Hearings have little impact on impeachment views, and Bloomberg debuts in 5th in Super Tuesday states

With the House set to vote on impeaching Mr. Trump, the public remained divided on whether he deserved impeachment. Hours of public hearings had not swayed public opinion very much.

If or when the matter heads to the Senate, the public is split on what should happen: 42% think the president should be convicted and removed from office, while the same percentage say the Senate should not convict him or not hold a trial at all.

December's Battleground Tracker interviewed Democratic voters across the 14 states holding primaries on March 3, known as Super Tuesday. These are the states where one of the latest entrants into the race – former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg — is focusing his attention and his money. Bloomberg debuted in fifth place across the Super Tuesday states, getting 4% of the vote in the Battleground Tracker.

Kamala Harris exited the race for president in early December, and her supporters in the Super Tuesday states moved primarily to Biden and Warren.

As 2019 comes to a close, the campaign has elicited mixed emotions from Democrats in these states: More of them said they feel nervous about it than optimistic.

With 2019 soon behind us, many people are thinking about the year ahead. Forty-two percent of U.S. adults plan to make resolutions for 2020, although 56% do not. Continuing with a trend from last year, younger people are more likely than those who are older to say they'll make resolutions. Maybe it's because younger adults will have more time to contemplate resolutions. 70% of those under age 35 say it's very likely they will stay up until midnight on New Year's Eve; a figure that drops to 38% among those 65 years and older.

2020: What's ahead?

Looking ahead, 2020 will be full of happenings on the political front, including the impeachment trial and the presidential election. Will the partisan divides we have seen in recent years remain? Who will be the Democratic nominee? What will we be talking about at this time next year? The CBS News polling team will continue to measure the views of the American public on the key issues and events that arise. Keep watching."

But his numbers are unchewable. Whether the topic is Chinese job losses, foreign investment or trade, Trump has a habit of misleading audiences on the state of Asia’s largest economy. He also routinely exaggerates the effect of U.S. tariffs on China’s economy.

We rounded up some of the statistics Trump dishes out at campaign rallies, on Twitter and to reporters. The claims we’re fact-checking are all drawn from the president’s remarks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on Monday. But he has been repeating the same or similar figures for months. This is a roundup, so we won’t be awarding Pinocchios — but his claims are certainly misleading.

“China wants to talk. They want to talk. China’s lost 3 million jobs.”

It’s a mystery where Trump gets this number, which seems to grow or shrink with each telling.

At the end of July, Trump tweeted, “China has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to the Trump Tariffs.” In August, he said, “China has lost 2 million jobs in the last month and a half.” Later that month, the number was “2½ million.” Now it’s 3 million.

As the BBC reported, “there is no official Chinese data specifically on job losses as a result of the US-China trade war, but economic surveys carried out by two Chinese banks suggest a range of 1.2 [million] to 1.9 million jobs were impacted by the trade war in the industrial sector.”

The White House did not respond to our questions, but it previously sent the BBC an article from the South China Morning Post with some figures. Here’s what the BBC reported Aug. 30:

This article quoted a report from a Chinese investment bank, China International Capital Corp (CICC), with an estimate of trade war-related job losses in the manufacturing sector of up to 1.9 million between July 2018 and May 2019. When pressed further, Mr Trump's spokesperson said the CICC survey had not included data after May, when there had been a significant increase in tariffs on goods from China. However, no explanation was offered as to where the figure of three million — or the 2.5 million a week earlier — had been sourced.

When we asked Trump’s campaign about the 3 million figure, a spokesman sent the same article in the South China Morning Post and its estimate of almost 2 million job losses stemming from the trade war.

“I know of no reliable evidence that indicates that China has lost 3 million jobs because of the trade war,” Robert Daly, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, wrote in an email. “China had embarked on a historic restructuring of its economy before the trade war began. Before Trump’s election, Beijing had committed to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption, stronger service industries, and moving up the manufacturing value chain from assembly work to high tech. A reduction in the manufacturing labor force (let’s say it is 3 million jobs) must therefore be measured against job growth in China’s tech and service sectors.”

Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Trump’s claim of millions of Chinese job losses is “delusional.”

“Employment in broad manufacturing has been falling over the past year, but at a slower pace than in 2014-17, before the tariffs were imposed,” Lardy wrote in a blog post Aug. 29. “China’s exports to the rest of the world are growing enough to more than offset the lost sales to the United States, so employment losses due directly to the trade war seem to be de minimis.”

Derek Scissors, an expert on the Chinese economy at the American Enterprise Institute, said “300,000 jobs, not 3 million, could be a reasonable estimate for the U.S. tariff effect.”

“Chinese exports to the U.S. have begun falling,” Scissors said. “Through July, they’ve done about $25 billion [less] — goods and services — compared to 2018 through July. That is a concrete loss to China. It’s also a reversal of trend, so Chinese losses are larger as compared to what their exports could be without tariffs. But there is no way to get millions of jobs lost — the export decline is far too small for that given the size of China’s economy.”

David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies the Chinese economy and served as an Obama administration economic official based in Beijing, said: “China’s overall exports so far this year are flat compared to 2018, so it seems unlikely that there are large employment changes.”

“Thousands of companies are leaving China. The supply chain is crumbling because they can’t pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you would have never thought.”

Trump claims “thousands of companies” have been leaving China since his tariffs took effect, but neither his administration nor his campaign has offered proof.

The Trump campaign spokesman pointed to a July 14 article in the Wall Street Journal, which said the U.S. manufacturers behind “Crocs shoes, Yeti beer coolers, Roomba vacuums and GoPro cameras are producing goods in other countries to avoid U.S. tariffs of as much as 25% on some $250 billion of imports from China,” among others.

But China has more than half a million foreign-invested firms, according to the Peterson Institute. Multinational companies with Chinese operations in some cases say they’re leaving, or planning to leave, because of rising labor costs or lower costs in neighboring countries such as Vietnam. Those dynamics predated Trump’s tariffs.

Lardy, the Peterson Institute expert, wrote in a blog post Sept. 10 that “a handful of firms leaving China do not confirm a broad trend.” Many foreign companies are in China to access the sizable Chinese market, Lardy wrote, while some of the biggest exporters with Chinese operations, such as Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, a key supplier to Apple, are too entrenched in China to be able to relocate easily.

“Nonfinancial foreign direct investment (FDI) in China is currently running at an annual rate of almost $140 billion, meaning that thousands of new foreign firms are established in China every month,” Lardy wrote. “Since the tariff war broke out in mid-2018 FDI has expanded about 3 percent annually, roughly the same pace as in the previous five years. And the recent data do not reflect massive new investments in chemical plants. China recently approved wholly foreign-owned investments by both ExxonMobil and BASF, each at a record setting $10 billion. Since ground has not yet been broken, these two projects are not yet included in FDI data.”

A survey published in August by the U.S.-China Business Council found that 81 percent of members’ businesses had been affected by the trade tensions, up from 73 percent a year earlier.

But the same survey showed that 87 percent of members had no plans to leave China, while 95 percent said they were in the country to serve the Chinese market. “If you are there to serve the Chinese market, then the trade war provides more, not less, incentive to invest there,” said Dollar, the Brookings Institution researcher.

AEI’s Scissors said: “Tariffs are applied much more quickly than companies decide to exit a large market, so we don’t have useful data on this yet. We know thousands of companies are considering leaving China. It’s also possible that thousands of companies have left, as small East Asian companies may be relocating within the region.”

“Hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China’s eating the cost, which the fake news doesn’t want to tell you.”

Trump has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese imports, and the Chinese have retaliated with their own levies on U.S. goods.

In the last year, U.S. tariffs on imports worldwide produced $63 billion, nearly half of which, or $27 billion, came from Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports and other products. (It’s important to note that China has retaliated in part by shunning U.S. agricultural products such as soybeans. Trump said at his North Carolina rally that his administration, as a result, has subsidized U.S. farmers to the tune of $28 billion. “We’ve given them $28 billion so that they’re whole,” he said.)

Economists widely agree that the cost of tariffs ultimately falls on manufacturers and consumers, as Trump recently acknowledged.

The Washington Post reported Aug. 2 that “Trump’s latest import tax would cost a typical family of four $350 a year in addition to $850 from existing China tariffs, according to the Tax Foundation.”

An analysis in May by Goldman Sachs found that “the costs of U.S. tariffs have fallen entirely on U.S. businesses and households, with no clear reduction in the prices charged by Chinese exporters” and that prices for nine categories of taxed goods — such as auto parts, furniture and floor coverings — were rising faster than inflation.

A paper published on March 2 by three prominent U.S. economists found “that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.” Another paper, published March 3 by a different set of economists, found similar results. “Tradable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties are the most negatively affected by the trade war,” the paper said.

“I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they’ve had now the worst year in 57 years.”

China’s second-quarter growth rate was the slowest in 27 years — not 57, as Trump repeatedly claims.

As The Post’s Anna Fifield reported in July: “Official figures from the National Bureau of Statistics — which economists tend to take with a grain of salt, viewing them as likely too rosy — showed that the annual growth rate slowed to 6.2 percent in the three months to the end of June, down from 6.4 percent the previous quarter.

“This is within the 6 to 6.5 percent band the government has set for this year and was in line with market expectations of a gradual slowdown. Still, it is China’s lowest growth rate since records began in March 1992.”

To jolt the slowing economy, the Chinese central bank said last week it is lowering the reserve requirement ratio for lenders by 0.5 percentage point on Monday, which essentially translates to injecting $126 billion into the country’s financial system, according to the New York Times.

“Many businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to stay open, unemployment is creeping up, and families are shouldering higher daily costs,” the Times reported.

(AP) — President Donald Trump sought to reassure his supporters about the state of the U.S. economy despite the stock market volatility and told rallygoers in New Hampshire, a state that he hopes to capture in 2020, that their financial security depends on his reelection.

“Whether you love me or hate me you have to vote for me,” Trump said.

Speaking to a boisterous crowd at Southern New Hampshire University Arena, Trump dismissed the heightened fears about the U.S. economy and a 3% drop Wednesday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was fueled by a slowing global economy and a development in the bond market that has predicted previous recessions. Avoiding an economic slump is critical to Trump’s reelection hopes.

“The United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world,” Trump said.

Trump, who reached the White House by promising to bring about a historic economic boom, claimed, as he often does, that the markets would have crashed if he had lost his 2016 bid for the presidency. And he warned that if he is defeated in 2020, Americans’ 401(k) retirement accounts will go “down the tubes.”

The Republican president also defended his tactics on trade with China. He has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion of imports from China and has threatened to hit the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports with 10% tariffs. He has delayed that increase on about half of those items to avoid raising prices for U.S. holiday shoppers. He said China wants to make a trade deal with the U.S. because it’s costing the country millions of jobs, but he claimed that the U.S. doesn’t need to be in a hurry.

“I don’t think we’re ready to make a deal,” Trump said.

Trump’s rally was the first since mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, killed 31 people and wounded dozens more. The shootings have reignited calls for Congress to take immediate action to reduce gun violence. Trump said the U.S. can’t make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves, but he advocated for expanding the number of facilities to house the mentally ill without saying how he would pay for it.

“We will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we won’t have to worry so much about them,” Trump said. “We don’t have those institutions anymore, and people can’t get proper care. There are seriously ill people and they’re on the streets.”

Along with discussion of the economy and guns, Trump hit a number of other topics, accusing the European Union of being “worse than China, just smaller”; bragging about his 2016 electoral victories in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania; and calling it a “disgrace” that people were throwing water on police officers in New York.

The rally was interrupted about a half an hour in by a handful of protesters near the rafters of the arena. As the protesters were being led out, a Trump supporter wearing a “Trump 2020” shirt near them began enthusiastically shaking his fist in a sign of support for the president.

But Trump mistook him for one of the protesters and said to the crowd: “That guy’s got a serious weight problem. Go home. Start exercising. Get him out of here, please.”

After a pause, he added, “Got a bigger problem than I do.”

New Hampshire, which gave Trump his first GOP primary victory but favored Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election, is doing well economically, at least when using broad measures. But beneath the top-line data are clear signs that the prosperity is being unevenly shared, and when the tumult of the Trump presidency is added to the mix, the state’s flinty voters may not be receptive to his appeals.

An August University of New Hampshire Survey Center poll found that 42% of New Hampshire adults approve of Trump while 53% disapprove. The poll also showed that 49% approve of Trump’s handling of the economy and 44% disapprove.

Some Democratic presidential campaigns are holding events to capitalize on Trump’s trip. Joe Biden’s campaign set up down the street from the arena to talk to voters and enlist volunteers. A group for Pete Buttigieg’s campaign gathered in nearby Concord to call voters about his support for new gun safety laws. And Cory Booker urged Trump to cancel the speech and instead order Congress to take immediate action to prevent gun violence.

At 2.4%, New Hampshire’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for May was among the lowest in the nation. But wage growth is significantly below national gains. Average hourly earnings rose a scant 1.1% in New Hampshire in 2018, lagging the 3% gain nationwide, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In other ways, like the home ownership rate — first in the nation — and median household income — seventh in the U.S. — the state is thriving, according to census data.

New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes are far below that of key swing states like Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan, but its influence can prove powerful in close election years like 2000, when George W. Bush’s victory in the state gave him the edge needed to win the White House.

From trade to spending, from the Federal Reserve to paid parental leave, Trump has embraced policy changes that historically are more in line with the approach of Democrats — establishing a forceful role for government in setting the terms of the economy — than of Republicans.

It is a sharp contrast to his first two years, when his main achievements included cutting regulations and a significant tax overhaul that emphasized reducing corporate tax rates — traditional bastions of policymaking for the GOP.

Trump has still pursued cuts to government spending that pinch poorer Americans — tightening rules on food stamps and allowing states to reduce Medicaid enrollment, for instance — that have fueled constant Democratic accusations he has betrayed voters.

But the breadth of Trump’s break with the GOP is striking.

On trade, Trump has reached a “phase one” trade deal with China that reportedly includes promises to buy far more in U.S. exports. He has completed a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada that some liberals are cheering for labor protections and pharmaceutical policies.

Trump co-opted a demand from the left to urge the Fed to cut interest rates despite the relatively strong economy, a position the central bank ultimately adopted after seeing signs the economic expansion might waver.

The president has blown away traditional GOP concerns over the rising federal deficit, cutting bipartisan deals to expand government spending and even extend a new paid-leave benefit to the federal workforce. He unilaterally implemented a farm bailout that could prove more expensive than the auto bailout was a decade ago — a move that conservatives had criticized as wasting taxpayer dollars.

And while taking action against former president Barack Obama’s health-care law in court, the Trump administration has avoided moves to immediately blow up the law while pushing to allow states to import cheaper prescription drugs — a longtime liberal position opposed by many Republicans.

Trump’s steps away from conservative economic orthodoxy have been building since the 2016 presidential campaign, when he shocked GOP elites on his way to a blowout victory in the Republican primary. But in many ways they appeared to reach their culmination in 2019.

“The administration this year has appeared to change its focus away from working with Congress on more typical Republican proposals and toward an increasing focus on populist priorities,” said G. William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee.

Some analysts say the emphasis on populist economics could upend the 2020 presidential election, as the issues that may have helped give Democrats control of the House in the 2018 midterms — particularly the attempt to repeal Obamacare and the Republican tax law — could recede while other White House initiatives become more prominent.

The Trump administration is likely to continue its aggressive trade actions in its fourth year, turning to negotiations with the United Kingdom, Europe and possibly India and Vietnam, said Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy, in an interview.

These economic priorities contrast with the highly partisan politics of impeachment, which is expected to play out with a Senate trial early next year.

Democrats maintain that Trump sold out his working-class base to the GOP donor class after his election, but the attack may grow less potent as the tax cut in particular loses its immediacy.

Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster at Lake Research Partners, said that Democratic elites such as lawmakers, think-tank leaders and consultants have been alarmed by Trump’s economic populism.

“Typically, Republicans offer things like the deficit and the stock market — the upscale economic agenda — but Trump is trying to include the semblance of a working-class economic agenda,” she said. “It isn’t real when you look underneath the hood, but it sure looks real, absent an alternative.”

Trump’s policy shift also illustrates his power over congressional Republicans.

Two core party constituencies for decades — free-market traders and deficit hawks — are at risk of being effectively exiled from the GOP, as some Republican lawmakers quietly fume at being sidelined repeatedly over policy matters.

“I see the restraints coming off all over the place. It’s been a less cautious approach as Trump has realized he doesn’t have to pay attention to traditional Republican advisers,” said Ed Dolan, an economist at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian-leaning think tank. “There don’t seem to be any conservative voices around him anymore that disagree with him.”

Less trade uncertainty, lower interest rates and more government spending will mean an economy growing faster than it otherwise would, even if expectations remain for modest 2 percent growth in 2020. That could be a boon to the president’s reelection prospects, though Democrats say Americans are still hurt by stagnant wages and widespread economic anxiety.

Trump’s policies could still create longer-term risk. The surge in federal deficits and cuts to interest rates may limits the tools the United States has to respond to an economic downturn, should one arrive in the final year of Trump’s first term or later.

And, politically, Trump could remain vulnerable on health care, a top concern among voters, having overseen a rise in costs and the number of people without insurance.

“I really say it’s mostly lip service,” Dean Baker, an economist at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said of Trump’s populism while in office. “If you look at his big changes, it’s really the tax cut that went to the top 1 percent, and there’s no dispute from that. The rich have really benefited and everyone else gets a show.”

Trump may point to steady economic growth and historically low unemployment numbers, but critics say those are largely disconnected from his populist economic policies.

“Most of the jobs that have been created are in the services-type industries — his constituency in the middle of the country may not be helped by a lot of these policies,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. “And trying to change these forces of globalization — it won’t have an impact for 10 or 20 years, if it happens at all. These are very slow-moving forces.”

Kayleigh McEnany, a spokeswoman for Trump’s reelection campaign, said in a statement: “Trump promised to change decades of failed trade policy, revive manufacturing, and bring relief to middle class families. He has done all that and more.”

Trump’s presidency began with an unsuccessful effort to undo Obama’s 2010 health-care legislation, which would have cut federal spending but also cost millions of Americans their health insurance. Republicans then united successfully around a more than $1.5 trillion tax cut.

“When Trump first came into office, the priorities he agreed with — the tax bill, repealing Obamacare — required legislation, and so he needed Hill Republicans led by orthodox conservative Paul D. Ryan,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

But since Democrats gained control of the House starting in 2019, the White House has had to compromise with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) or act unilaterally.

“What changed this year is that for the policy issues on the table he could move unilaterally, and he did,” Holtz-Eakin said. “These are nontraditional Republican positions, and they have come to the fore in the past year.”

Among the most serious clashes with his party has been one over trade. Republicans have traditionally resisted tariffs and supported large business groups in their quest for expanding international markets. Democrats have typically led the charge to crack down on China trade practices and revamp NAFTA.

Trump flipped this dynamic upside-down. After blasting the United States’ trade relations with foreign nations as a presidential candidate, Trump took action on the issue by launching a trade war with China and slapping increasingly aggressive tariffs on other countries.

Business groups that had been strongly supportive of the tax overhaul criticized Trump for raising prices for American consumers and disrupting global supply chains.

Trump’s advisers were in the meantime willing to agree to significant concessions to House Democrats and labor groups to seal a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, angering some Republicans but also earning the pact bipartisan cover.

“Trump’s unique brand of populism is essentially an economic nationalism based on an ‘America First’ perspective, applied to both domestic policies and the international trade arena,” said Navarro, the Trump trade adviser. “This revolution has repositioned the Republican Party into the party of the working class.”

“In the past,” he said, “Republicans were willing to sacrifice our economy on the altar of national security — but if you do that you wind up losing both.”

Perhaps just as surprising is how Trump has upended the GOP positions on both monetary and fiscal policy.

The president demanded Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell reverse course and back off raising interest rates. At the same time, the president has rejected Fed nominees, pushed by traditional conservatives, who probably would have raised rates.

“It seems that [Trump’s] appointments are fully on board for the critique leftists have been making about monetary policy,” said Sam Bell, founder and policy director of Employ America, a left-leaning organization advocating on economic policy.

A spending splurge under Trump may mark an even more dramatic retreat in conservative economic policy, as annual deficits have risen to close to $1 trillion despite the sustained run of economic growth.

Trump campaigned on preventing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, largely bucking long-standing GOP calls to reduce the national deficit by targeting the two large government programs. In practice, his administration has gone even further than avoiding cuts to those programs, expanding federal spending in multiple budget deals while opportunistically using them to win concessions on other priorities, such as the Space Force.

Trump’s policy opportunism may be novel for American politics, but his grab bag of economic positions fits a bigger global trend of conservative populists such as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has pledged to increase spending on Britain’s national health program.

“Populist forces are a global phenomenon,” said Pippa Norris, a political scientist at Harvard. “They cut across the traditional left-right cleavage. Many populists aren’t traditional free-market neoliberals or fiscal conservatives in their economic policies.”

Whether that will permanently remake the Republican Party, on the other hand, remains an open question."

In a series of outbursts Trump “hereby ordered” US companies to stop doing business with China, accused the country of killing 100,000 Americans a year with imported fentanyl and stealing hundred of billions in intellectual property.

The attack marked a new low in Sino-US relations and looks certain to escalate a trade war already worrying investors, manufacturers and economists who are concerned that the dispute between the two economic superpowers could trigger a recession.

Not so long ago Trump called China’s president, Xi Jinping, “a good friend”. Now he is an “enemy”. How did we get here?

China, China, China

On the campaign trail Trump railed against China accusing it of pulling off “one of the greatest thefts in the history of the world” and “raping” the US economy.

Trump repeated the word China so often it spawned a viral video of him saying it over and over again. The attacks were a hit with voters and helped get him elected. He has continued lambasting China – to cheers – at rallies ever since.

His main beef? The trade deficit.

Trade deficit

The US imported a record $539.5bn in goods from China in 2018 and sold the Chinese $120.3bn in return. The difference between those two numbers – $419.2bn – is the trade deficit.

That deficit has been growing for years as manufacturing has shifted to low-cost China and, according to Trump, it explains the hollowing out of US manufacturing.

For Trump, and especially for his adviser Peter Navarro, who once described China as “the planet’s most efficient assassin”, trade deficits represent an existential threat to US jobs and national security. China makes up the largest part of the US trade deficit but those fears are also behind his disputes with the EU, Canada and Mexico.

His detractors argue these deficit worries are hyperbole and a result of the US’s stronger economy, which allows consumers to buy goods at cheaper prices.

The truth is probably somewhere in between.

While it’s true that unemployment is at record lows and consumers continue to prop up the economy, manufacturing jobs have been lost (automation is also to blame for this) and with them wage growth (although the hollowing out of unions plays a part here).

But it is not just deficits that concerns Trump.

Thieves

China has a deserved reputation for intellectual property theft. On Friday, Trump estimated China robs the US of “hundreds of billions” a year in ideas.

In March, a CNBC poll found one in five US corporations had intellectual property stolen from them within the last year by China.

According to the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, the theft costs $600bn a year.

Beijing bucks

Like Tesla, Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company, is suffering as subsidies for EVs are phased out. Unlike Tesla, Nio has Xi. China is pumping $1.5bn into the company to keep it on the road, the latest in a series of handouts that the Trump administration believes are unfair.

Cheap steel and aluminium, subsidized by the Chinese government, are the origins of this trade dispute. According to the White House, last year alone China dumped and unfairly subsidized goods including steel wheels, tool chests and cabinets and rubber bands on to the US market.

To be fair the US too is more than willing to bail out its industries (see: the banks or the automakers) at the taxpayers’ expense. But at this point “fair” is not up for discussion.

Currency manipulator

Earlier this month the US officially accused China of manipulating its currency “to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade”.

It was the first time since 1994 that such a complaint has been made official and comes as the dollar has strengthened against world currencies. The dispute adds another layer of tension to a complex situation.

China disputed the charge accusing the US of “deliberately destroying international order” with “unilateralism and protectionism”.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears to be on China’s side, arguing the devaluation of the yuan is largely in line with worsening economic conditions in China.

What happens next?

The US has now slapped billions of dollars on tariffs on Chinese goods. China retaliated, again, on Friday with more levies on US goods. China’s economic growth has slowed to levels unseen since 1992; US economic forecasts have also been cut.

American farmers were the first to feel the result, as China has canceled orders, and manufacturers are increasingly gloomy. So far US consumers have not felt the pinch but JP Morgan estimates the average US household will end up paying an extra $1,000 a year for goods if the latest set of tariffs go through.

The unanswerable question is whether any of this will sway Trump. If his supporters continue to see a trade war with China – and the pain it will cause – as the necessary price to Make America Great Again, then the answer is probably no."
139,How the Trump Administration's Venezuela Policy Just Doesn't Add Up - Wilson Center,How the Trump Administration's Venezuela Policy Just Doesn't Add Up  Wilson Center,"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbHNvbmNlbnRlci5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9ob3ctdGhlLXRydW1wLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9ucy12ZW5lenVlbGEtcG9saWN5LWp1c3QtZG9lc250LWFkZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Wilson Center,"Even for an administration given to a chaotic and improvisational foreign policy style, the first days of August were exceptional. In the space of a week, and in seemingly uncoordinated fashion, President Trump signed an executive order that prohibited all U.S. economic transactions with Venezuelan government entities, at the same time slapping secondary sanctions on others doing business with the Venezuelan government; the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) froze new obligations of what could amount to billions of dollars in international spending for development assistance, global health, and support for UN agencies and peacekeeping, among others foreign accounts; Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier resigned, reportedly after clashes with the White House over immigration policy; and the Trump administration announced a controversial “public charge” rule giving the Department of Homeland Security the authority to deny visas and entry into the United States of those likely to depend on federal assistance such as food stamps.

What unites these seemingly disparate threads is a contradiction at the core of Trump administration’s Venezuela policy: the imposition of crippling economic sanctions aimed at the implosion of the Nicolás Maduro regime, while doing far too little to assist the region in absorbing the millions of refugees resulting from the country’s economic collapse. The Trump administration’s hostility to immigration and to foreign aid spending overall clashes openly with the effort to procure regime change via the economic strangulation of the Maduro government. This inconsistency is not lost on Latin American and Caribbean countries, which have received the bulk of over 4 million refugees that have fled Venezuela, the majority since 2015.

Consider the prelude to President Trump’s August 5 executive order (EO) “Blocking Property of the Government of Venezuela.” On August 3, Michael P. Duffey of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructed the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to freeze obligations of unspent foreign aid funds in fifteen different accounts, pending an OMB review. According to published reports, the freeze mirrors an effort last year by OMB director Mick Mulvaney to return billions of dollars in unobligated foreign aid to the U.S. Treasury. This year’s OMB request was made during a congressional recess and less than two months before the end of the fiscal year. Congressional critics have denounced the OMB’s actions as undermining Congress’s power of the purse. Nonetheless, according to the Washington Post, OMB has indicated its intention to rescind what could amount to $2-4 billion in foreign spending, while exempting favored projects of Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

Against this backdrop, the EO issued by the White House two days later goes beyond previous U.S. financial and oil sanctions on Venezuela, blocking all current and future “property and interests in property of the Government of Venezuela that are in the United States.” The EO adds so-called secondary sanctions aimed at “any person determined…to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support” to the Venezuelan government. This latter provision is broadly understood as aimed at China and Russia, who have provided tens of billions of dollars in loans and investments to Venezuela. Issued on the eve of a major international summit in Lima, Peru, to build support for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the sanctions dominated headlines—as did the presence of U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, there to announce a large package of reconstruction assistance following a democratic transition. But the new U.S. sanctions failed to garner regional support. Peruvian Foreign Minister Néstor Popolizio, who hosted the meeting, issued a lukewarm stating saying only that participating countries had “taken note” of the U.S. government’s decision. (Peru has the second largest number of Venezuelan refugees in the region, close to 900,000.) Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, who only weeks before had issued a blistering report condemning torture, extrajudicial executions, and imprisonment of political opponents by the Maduro government, said that U.S. “unilateral sanctions” were “likely to significantly exacerbate the crisis for millions of ordinary Venezuelans.”

The new U.S. sanctions make exceptions for food, medicine, clothing, and remittances and do not cover dealings with the Venezuelan private sector. In practice, however, these may be distinctions without a difference. According to an analysis by the international law firm Alston and Bird, “certain types of business transactions, even with private counterparties, may require transactions with government agencies or regulators.” Hence, they conclude, “an assessment of the risk versus possible profits associated with doing business in Venezuela may very well lead many banks, exporters, and other businesses to conclude that it is preferable to treat Venezuela like one of the officially, comprehensively sanctioned countries/regions.”

Even before the announcement of additional sanctions, the International Monetary Fund projected that Venezuela’s economy would shrink by an additional 35 percent this year, meaning the country’s economy has seen an over 60 percent cumulative decline since Maduro came into power in 2013. A 2018 survey by leading Venezuelan universities puts the poverty rate at above 90 percent, with households unable to meet basic nutritional needs. In these conditions, what was a human exodus last year of 5,000 per day will only continue to expand. Yet as of July 31, 2019, the international community had provided only 23.9 percent—less than a quarter—of the funds needed for regional refugee assistance. The United States provided some 67 percent of the total. But now, the OMB freeze of international accounts threatens additional support by USAID and the State Department’s Office of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), to Colombia, Peru, and other migrant-receiving countries.

Crushing an already moribund Venezuelan economy via new sanctions while curtailing assistance to Venezuela’s neighbors is deleterious enough to U.S. national interests in a stable hemisphere. But the added blow to U.S. standing and leadership comes from Trump administration migration policy: the slashing of refugee admissions to the United States to historic lows, while refusing to grant protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans already in the United States. A bipartisan majority in the U.S. Congress favors granting such protections, known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The administration is reluctant to grant to Venezuelans something that it has already taken away from Salvadorans, Haitians, and others. But the administration may well grant Venezuelans a respite similar to TPS known as Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), to avoid charges of a double standard while saving face with a key bloc of voters in Florida.

Venezuela needs democratic change. How to get there—and how long it will take—remain the only real questions. For now, all the chest-thumping in the world cannot obscure the central inconsistency of Trump administration policy: a gamble that inflicting maximum economic pain on the Maduro regime will make it cry ‘uncle,’ while leaving others to handle the human costs.

“The interesting thing about Donald Trump, I mean he's not a trained economist,” Moore told “Sunday Morning Futures.” “They have 300 Ph.D. economists over at the Fed, but he has a better feel for the economy than the economists over at over at the Federal Reserve.”

Moore said the economy has slowed down slightly due to the Fed being “too tight” with monetary policy and the ongoing trade war with China, though he still supports the president’s handling of the situation.

“This is short term pain for long term gain,” Moore said of Trump’s strategy. “China is a big problem … Everything they're doing whether it's stealing our intellectual property, whether it's closing off their market to us – Trump is fighting the good fight here. But yeah it's hurting the economy.”

Also, while the Fed cut interest rates last month by a quarter-point, the president still railed against the U.S. central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, for not making a larger rate cut. Moore said Trump’s call for a rate cut of a full point would be “a little bit aggressive.”

Moore also said that the Fed needs to inject more dollar liquidity into the U.S. economy and “they need to do it quickly,” and is calling for the central bank to hold an emergency meeting.

“Why wait till the middle of September?” Moore said. “It's only going to slow down the economy if they wait.”"

Nonetheless, in the latest Gallup poll of presidential job approval, Trump stands at 20% among nonwhites, up from a low of 14% in January.

The country presented by President Donald Trump is roaring and ascendant , shattering all economic records for performance.

The reality, of course, is more complex.

After three turns on the debate stage by the Democratic candidates, it’s become clear that for the most part they hew to actual statistics and other fundamentals more closely than does Trump, who routinely says false things and repeats them as if willing them into being.

That’s not to say the Democrats are beacons of accuracy. Some will use older statistics when newer ones don’t suit their argument or give a selective reading of history when that fits the story they want to tell. Sometimes what they don’t say speaks loudly, as when they won’t acknowledge the cost of their plans or the likely tax hit on average people.

A sampling:

ECONOMY AND TRADE

TRUMP: “All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women.” — tweet Friday.

THE FACTS: The unemployment rate for women has not reached an “all time best” during the Trump administration.

It did fall to 3.1% in April, the lowest since October 1953. But that is still far higher than the record set in May 1953 of 2.4%.

It’s a fact that Trump has acknowledged, having repeatedly joked at campaign rallies this year how he’s fallen short on the women’s unemployment rate. “I always say kiddingly, ‘I’m sorry I didn’t make it historic’ but you know what, it’s going to be historic very soon,” he said last week in North Carolina.

Since April, the unemployment rate for women has actually ticked higher to 3.3%.

___

TRUMP: “How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country?” — tweet Friday.

THE FACTS: “Perhaps” is a rare bit of modesty in this frequent boast by Trump but he is still wrong in claiming the U.S. has its best economy ever.

In the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 — the same pace it reached in 2015 under President Barack Obama — and hasn’t hit historically high growth rates.

The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low of 3.7%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the 1990s. More Americans are now out of the workforce, taking care of children or relatives, or going to school, while others became discouraged about their job prospects and stopped looking. The government doesn’t count people as unemployed unless they are actively searching for jobs. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too.

___

TRUMP, on China’s economy. “By the way, China is having the worst year they’ve had now in 57 years, OK? Fifty-seven.” — remarks Wednesday in meeting on e-cigarettes.

TRUMP: “They’ve had now the worst year in 57 years.” — North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.

THE FACTS: That’s not true. China is far from the impoverished disaster of a half century ago, when it was reeling from the massive famine caused by Mao Zedong’s radical economic policies and heading into the chaos of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.

China’s economy is indeed slowing from Trump’s taxes on Chinese imports, as well as its own campaign to constrain runaway debt. The International Monetary Fund expects the Chinese economy to grow 6.2% this year. That’s the slowest growth for China in nearly 30 years. But it’s still markedly faster than U.S. growth.

Since overhauling its economy in the late 1970s, China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, established a growing middle class and surpassed Japan to become the world’s second-biggest economy.

___

TRUMP: “Hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost.” — remarks at North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.

THE FACTS: Americans are also eating the cost.

As he escalates a trade war with China, Trump refuses to recognize that tariffs are mainly, if not entirely, paid by companies and consumers in the country that imposes them.

In a study in May, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with Princeton and Columbia universities, estimated that tariffs from Trump’s trade dispute with China were costing $831 per U.S. household on an annual basis, before tariffs were recently escalated. Analysts also found that the burden of Trump’s tariffs falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imported products.

A report last month by JPMorgan Chase estimated that tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 per year if tariffs on an additional $300 billion of U.S. imports from China proceed in September and December. Trump has since bumped up the scheduled levies even higher, probably adding to the U.S. burden.

___

BERNIE SANDERS: “We have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: This oft-repeated line by the Vermont senator is an exaggeration.

There are nearly 200 countries in the world, many with people living in extreme poverty that most Americans would struggle to fathom. Poverty is also a relative measure in which someone who is poor in one nation might look rather prosperous in another.

But the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development updated its child poverty report in 2018. The United States had an above average level of child poverty, but it was not at the bottom of the 42 nations listed in the report. The United States still fared better than Russia, Chile, Spain, India, Turkey, Israel, Costa Rica, Brazil, South Africa and China.

___

TRUMP: “We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.” — North Carolina rally.

THE FACTS: His tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in U.S. history.

It’s a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. As a share of the total economy, a tax cut of that size ranks 12th, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 cut is the biggest, followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II.

Post-Reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant: President George W. Bush’s cuts in the early 2000s and Obama’s renewal of them a decade later.

___

GUNS

TRUMP: “Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans so they’re totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house with a gun.” — remarks Thursday to House Republicans in Baltimore.

THE FACTS: That’s a vast overstatement. No Democratic candidates have proposed stripping all guns from Americans. One of the top 10 candidates, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, has proposed confiscating assault-type weapons such as the AK-47 through a mandatory buyback program.

___

MIGRANTS

JOE BIDEN, on the treatment of migrants in his time as Obama’s vice president: “We didn’t lock people up in cages.” — Democratic presidential debate Thursday.

THE FACTS: Yes, they did.

The “cages” — chain-link enclosures inside border facilities where migrants have been temporarily housed, separated by sex and age — were built and used by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has been using the same facilities.

Democrats routinely accuse Trump of using cages for migrant children without acknowledging the same enclosures were employed when Biden was vice president.

___

HEALTH CARE

BERNIE SANDERS: “Every study done shows that ‘Medicare for All’ is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman and child in this country.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: No, not every study.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this year that total spending under a single-payer system, such as the one proposed by Sanders, “might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system.”

Those features involve details about payment rates for hospitals and doctors, which are not fully spelled out by Sanders, as well as the estimated cost of generous benefits that include long-term care services and no copays and deductibles for comprehensive medical care.

A report this year by the Rand think tank estimated that Medicare for All would modestly raise national health spending, the opposite of what the Vermont senator intends.

Rand modeled a hypothetical scenario in which a plan similar to legislation by the Vermont senator had taken effect this year. It found that total U.S. health care spending would be about $3.9 trillion under Medicare for All in 2019, compared with about $3.8 trillion under the status quo.

Part of the reason is that Medicare for All would offer generous benefits with no copays and deductibles, except limited cost-sharing for certain medications. Virtually free comprehensive medical care would lead to big increases in the demand for services.

___

TRUMP: “Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years.” — North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.

THE FACTS: He’s exaggerating his influence on drug prices, which haven’t fallen for brand-name drugs, the area that worries consumers the most.

Most of his administration’s “ambitious campaign” to reduce drug prices has yet to be completed. Major regulations are in the works and legislation has yet to be passed by Congress. A rule requiring drugmakers to disclose prices in TV ads has been blocked for now by the courts.

Harsh criticism of the industry — from Trump and lawmakers of both parties in Congress — may be having some effect, however.

The Commerce Department’s inflation index for prescription drug prices has declined in seven of the past eight months, which is highly unusual. That index includes lower-cost generic drugs, which account for 90% of prescriptions filled in the U.S. Prices for generics have been declining under pressure from big drug distributors.

For brand-name drugs, though, a recent analysis by The Associated Press shows that on average prices are still going up, but at a slower pace. The cost of brand-name drugs is what’s most concerning to consumers, with insured patients facing steep copays for some medications.

The AP analysis found that in the first seven months of 2019, drugmakers raised list prices for brand-name medicines by a median, or midpoint, of 5%.

That does reflect a slowing in price increases. They were going up 9% or 10% over those months the prior four years. But it’s not a decrease in actual prices. There were 37 price increases for every decrease in the first seven months of 2019. Pricing data for the AP analysis came from the health information firm Elsevier.

___

ELIZABETH WARREN, asked whether her health plan would mean higher middle-class taxes: “We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle-class families are going to pay less. That’s how this is going to work. ... Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost.”

THE FACTS: That’s a dodge.

The senator from Massachusetts did not answer back-to-back questions about whether middle class taxes would go up from her version of Medicare for All.

It’s a given that consumers will pay less for health care if the government picks up the bills. But Sanders is almost alone among the candidates who support Medicare for All in acknowledging that broadly higher taxes would be needed to pay for that universal coverage. He would consider, and probably not be able to avoid, a tax increase on the middle class in exchange for health care without copayments, deductibles and the like. “Yes, they will pay more in taxes but less in health care,” he said in a June debate.

Some rivals, including Warren, have only spoken about taxing the wealthy and “Wall Street.” Analysts say that’s not going to cover the costs of government-financed universal care.

___

VETERANS

TRUMP: “We passed something they wanted to do for half a century: We passed VA Choice.” — North Carolina rally.

THE FACTS: It was Obama who won passage of the Veterans Choice program, which gives veterans the option to see private doctors outside the VA medical system at government expense. Congress approved the program in 2014, and Obama signed it into law. Trump expanded it.

___

EL PASO

BETO O’ROURKE, former U.S. representative from Texas, on last month’s mass shooting in El Paso: “Everything that I’ve learned about resilience, I’ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas, in the face of this act of terror, that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of United States. It killed 22 people, and injured many more, we were not defeated by that. Nor were we defined by that.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: Nobody has claimed that Trump “directed” the shooting. Earlier in the debate, O’Rourke had said the shooter was “inspired to kill by our president.” It is hard to know for sure what led the gunman to open fire inside a Walmart in El Paso, killing 22 people. The suspect posted a manifesto online before the shooting that echoed Trump’s comments on immigration. Yet the suspect said his own views “predate Trump and his campaign for president.”

The screed spoke of what the suspect called a “Hispanic invasion of Texas,” railed against immigrants and warned of an imminent attack. Nearly all of the victims had Latino last names.

The suspect purchased the gun legally, according to El Paso’s police chief.

___

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

KAMALA HARRIS, on Trump: “The only reason he has not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: We don’t know that it’s the only reason. Former special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t go that far in his report on Russian intervention in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice.

Harris, a California senator, is referring to a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents are immune from indictment. Mueller has said his investigators were restrained by that rule, but he also said that they never reached a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.

In Mueller’s congressional testimony in July, he said his team never started the process of evaluating whether to charge Trump.

If ever the U.S. economy could use a strong tax cut tail wind, it could use one now as conditions weaken around the world.

But the tail wind isn't there.

Instead, benefits from what President Donald Trump called ""the biggest reform of all time"" to the tax code have dwindled to a faint breeze just 20 months after its enactment. Half of corporate chief financial officers surveyed by Duke University expect the economy to shrink by the second quarter of 2020. Two-thirds expect a recession by the end of next year.

Corporate executives blame the darkening outlook on Trump's trade war with China. The president blames mismanagement by Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman he appointed.

But economists who have examined the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act say it isn't helping much in any of the ways advocates once advertised: overall growth, business investment, or worker pay. The strongest current case for the law's economic benefits is that it remains too early to see them.

Most broadly, the tax cuts have not generated the promised growth of 3% or more – even in tandem with the additional stimulus of large government spending increases that Congress enacted separately. After an uptick in the second quarter of 2018, growth declined in the next two quarters to end up at 2.9% for the year.

Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius says that second-quarter surge – initially measured at 4.2% but later revised down to 3.5% – represented the tax law's peak impact. He expects it to vanish altogether by late this year or early 2020, as the economy returns to the same 2% growth levels Trump inherited from President Barack Obama.

Those levels assure the failure of another tax cut promise. Trump and congressional Republicans insisted the law would spur so much economic activity that surging new revenues would replace those lost through lower tax rates.

In reality, deficits have soared back toward the $1 trillion mark reached during the Wall Street crisis and Great Recession a decade ago. A Congressional Research Service analysis concluded that the law has produced no more than 5% of the growth needed to offset tax cut losses.

Tax cut backers painted a picture of robust new business investment that would revive American manufacturing and create good-paying jobs at home. But investment and manufacturing have slumped so much lately that Powell cited their weakness in announcing interest rate cuts last month.

Economists say the improved 2018 growth resulted largely from the boost in aggregate demand generated by tax cuts and spending hikes. Increased demand was itself limited by the fact that so much of the tax cut proceeds went to higher-income households with lower propensity to spend.

Today, ""the economic benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act seem to have petered out,"" Tax Policy Center analysts wrote early this month. ""The economy's strength now seems to lie almost entirely with consumer spending.""

Like overall growth, business investment spiked temporarily in 2018. Economists disagree on whether that stemmed from new incentives in the tax cut law or just oil price increases that encouraged more domestic energy production.

An analysis by Alexander Arnon at the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model found that the rising price of oil ""explains the entire increase in the growth rate of investment in 2018."" The Penn Wharton Budget Model is directed by Kent Smetters, a former economist for President George W. Bush.

The idea that lower taxes would boost business investment sounds intuitive. But in examining lackluster investment growth after the 2017 tax cut compared with earlier ones, International Monetary Fund economists this spring identified an explanation: corporate consolidation has freed dominant firms with high profit margins to invest as they choose with less regard for government tax rates.

""In an environment of rising market power, corporate tax cuts become less effective at raising investment,"" the IMF economists wrote.

The economic expansion that began in 2010, now the longest in American history, has driven unemployment down to a 50-year low. But there's no sign the tax cut has fattened paychecks very much for average workers."

And more often than not, he focused his ire on one man: then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It’s possible the bigger threat to Trump’s presidency is now the economy, which is showing increasing signs of instability. And just as before, Trump appears genuinely worried and has found one man on which to focus his blame: Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell.

Powell could be in for a world of pain ahead of the 2020 election — especially if things do go south.

With the stock market tanking following Trump’s announcement of new China tariffs — amid other warning signs — the Trump administration on Tuesday gave itself a mulligan and delayed some of the more high-profile tariffs until late this year. That was the first sign there was real concern; Trump after all, had announced the tariffs less than two weeks earlier, and pulling back on them could easily be seen as a sign of weakness in his standoff with the Chinese.

That precipitated a rally in the stock market Tuesday. But then Wednesday, the inverted yield curve — which is generally acknowledged as one of the most prescient indicators of a recession — delivered more bad news. The markets fell again.

And Trump’s reaction to it all should erase any doubt about how concerned he is. He has spent much of the past 24 hours bashing Powell for not cutting the Fed’s interest rate fast enough — even as Powell has already given him some of the cutting he desires.

“Even now, you know, you see the interest rates,” Trump said Tuesday afternoon in Pennsylvania. “I’m paying a normalized interest rate. We should be paying less, frankly. This guy has made a big mistake. He’s made a big mistake — the head of the Fed. That was another beauty that I chose.”

Trump then took Powell to task on Twitter on Wednesday, after the inverted yield curve news.

“The Great [Fox Business host] Charles Payne ... correctly stated that Fed Chair Jay Powell made TWO enormous mistakes,” Trump began. “1. When he said ‘mid cycle adjustment.’ 2. We’re data dependent. ‘He did not do the right thing.’ I agree (to put it mildly!).”

Trump then returned to the subject a couple of hours later, arguing explicitly that his China trade war, which economists have spotlighted for their increasingly dour forecasts, is not to blame — Powell is.

“China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping,” Trump said, referring to unrest in the latter. “Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut.”

He added: “Spread is way too much as other countries say THANK YOU to clueless Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. Germany, and many others, are playing the game! CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE! We should easily be reaping big Rewards & Gains, but the Fed is holding us back.”

Trump his criticized Powell before, but he’s now upping the ante — expressing regret for appointing him (just as he did for Sessions) and more explicitly highlighting his mistakes (just as he did with Sessions’s Russia recusal, etc.).

As I argued earlier this week, the odds of a downturn or even a recession are perhaps Trump’s biggest hurdle to reelection. Amid all his controversies and unpopularity, the economy is what has buoyed Trump. Were it to go away or be neutralized, it’s difficult to see his already-difficult reelection math adding up. Even if it just costs him a few percentage points worth of voters, it would start to look insurmountable pretty quickly — unless he’s got a pretty badly wounded Democratic opponent.

Trump’s strategy in blaming Powell for whatever lies ahead would seem twofold: 1) He can lean on Powell to give him what he wants for fear of shouldering the blame for anything bad that happens (perhaps forestalling economic pain until after 2020). 2) If and when that bad stuff does happen, he can simply do what he always does and say, “It’s not my fault; this guy wouldn’t listen to me.”

Layer on top of that the complex inner workings of the Fed and economics in general, and very few people will truly know whom to believe. Even if economists side with Powell and blame Trump’s trade war (as they are now), it will be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy: the “deep state” working to take Trump down by kneecapping his great successes on the economy to unseat him, once and for all."

Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to “will” the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election. Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2019

""The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced — good for everyone!"" Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

The president's comments are the latest in a long line of attacks on the Fed — an independent agency that, like other central banks around the world, is insulated from short-term political interests — and its key decision-makers, several of whom are his own appointees.

""Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to 'will' the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election. Very Selfish!"" the president wrote.

Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Fed, which has raised rates seven times during his presidency. With the economy as the central focus of his re-election campaign for 2020, Trump is keen to keep the economy on an even keel.

Despite a robust stock market and the lowest unemployment in almost half a century, Trump insists ""the stock market would be 10,000 points higher"" and the economy would “go up like a rocket” if the Fed were to slice rates by one percent — a level that has traditionally only been associated with extreme economic uncertainty and recession.

Before the last two economic downturns, in 2001 and 2007, the Fed raised rates both times and did not lower rates until just before the recession hit a year later.

At its most recent meeting, in July, the Fed cut its benchmark borrowing rate by 0.25 percentage points, a move that Powell noted was not due to any ""political considerations"" but rather the result of mounting economic metrics that indicate a global slowdown in growth that would eventually hit the U.S.

Financial markets are expecting at least one more rate cut this year, possibly when the Fed meets next, on Sept. 17-18. Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on rate changes, are also pushing for a second rate cut, likely in December."

But the stock market chaos we’ve witnessed in recent weeks exposes the lie at the heart of this public relations campaign. And while market volatility can sometimes mean a bounce upward as well, the more significant economic indicators are even more revealing of the poor state of the economy once Trump’s hype has been dispelled.

The stock market chaos we’ve witnessed in recent weeks exposes the lie at the heart of this public relations campaign.

The truth is that the numbers that Trump holds up as proof of a thriving economy are masking an economy that, according to the two most credible early indicators, is actually on the precipice of a recession. One indicator is how Treasury bonds are doing, and Wednesday things went badly. The yield on 10-year bonds fell below the rate on the 2-year Treasury bond — this phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has always been a reliable early indicator of a recession because it best reflects bondholders’ short-term expectations for the economy.

The other indicator is unemployment. Despite an official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment count of 6.1 million unemployed workers, the real unemployed worker figure is more like 11.5 million. By not counting the 1.5 million “marginally attached” and “discouraged” workers, and especially by not counting the 4 million workers who are “part-time-of-necessity,” Trump’s official figure fails to capture the severe economic pain still being felt by far too many workers.

Of course, this undercounting of the real number of unemployed is just one piece of the larger picture, as there are tens of millions of counted workers who try to survive every day on low or minimum wages with marginal or no health insurance, sick leave, retirement security or parental leave. And then there are the millions of part-time workers who have no benefits at all.

Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer. In fact, the richest 1 percent have today a combined income that is 188 times greater than the bottom 90 percent of earners. Moreover, those fortunate few at the top account for 40 percent of the country’s net assets. Consider this: Forty percent of American families struggle each day just to pay their bills. One is hard-pressed to imagine these families thinking that we’re living in the “best economy we’ve ever had.”

To be fair, Trump is not to blame for all of the economic pain currently being felt around the country. But he is to blame for whitewashing it away in an effort to score political points — and not taking responsibility when things go wrong.

As is typical, Trump quickly scapegoated the Federal Reserve for Wednesday’s massive losses in the stock markets. In one tweet, he called the body’s chairman, Jay Powell, “clueless” before declaring: “We should easily be reaping big Rewards & Gains, but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win!”

But Wednesday’s losses were deep and across the board, meaning they are structural, they’re for real, and they’re foreboding. They cannot be pinned on how the Fed set interest rates. Instead, they are clear evidence of how Trump’s notion of a soaring economy is an alternate reality.

Our nation has faced deep structural economic problems before, and unlike Trump, our leaders of the past would rise to their challenges by being forthcoming about the problems in front of them — and about the bold solutions needed.

Faced with the despair and impoverishment of the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt seized the reins of the Democratic Party and gained the trust of the country by honestly addressing the economic challenge before it. FDR brought a focused vision and a comprehensive agenda to fix the problems.

Notably, he appointed Marriner Eccles, a banker from Utah and an early mentor of mine, as Fed Chairman from 1934 until 1948. This appointment was made because of FDR’s embrace of Eccles’ 1933 Senate testimony in which he laid out, as no one had before, the need to overhaul the prevailing model of capitalism and rein in the outsize influence of Wall Street on everyday Americans.

Eccles’ solution? He proposed higher and more progressive income and inheritance taxes as being essential to promoting economic growth, curbing inequality and forestalling political instability.

It’s illuminating that Eccles, who helped draft the Banking Act of 1933 (known as Glass-Steagall) and the Banking Act of 1935 that together would provide more oversight of and reduce the power of the banks, would, like FDR, find his motivation in a career-long battle against pervasive income inequality.

Our leaders of the past would rise to their challenges by being forthcoming about the problems in front of them – and about the bold solutions needed.

Today, we desperately need a new Roosevelt, and thereafter a new Eccles. We need leaders who are willing to level with the American people about the real challenges confronting workers and their families.

The first step is pointing out the obvious: This is simply not at all the “best economy we’ve ever had.”

Economic issues consistently rank as a top concern for both Democrats — of which I’m one — and independents. Democratic 2020 candidates must start doing a better job of both exposing the dirty truths behind Trump’s overblown tweets, and reminding the electorate that it’s the Democratic Party that knows who’s really unemployed and chronically underemployed.

And it’s only the Democratic Party that has the solutions to the pernicious income and wage inequalities that plague our society and our economy."

His daughter Ivanka Trump, an unelected government official, was directly responsible for the creation of 14 million jobs, he said.

“When she started this two and half years ago, her goal was 500,000 jobs,” the US president said.

Trump’s daughter is the co-chair of the White House workforce policy advisory board.

“She’s now created 14m jobs. And they’re being trained by these great companies – the greatest companies in the world – because the government can’t train them,” he said to applause from the crowd.

Lest one be left with the impression that this lie was sufficiently ridiculous, the president appended it immediately with an even more exaggerated prognostication. “Fourteen million … and going up,” he said.

Since Trump took office, the entire economy has added about 6m jobs as of October, according to FactCheck.org.

Earlier this year Trump floated a smaller version of this lie, claiming in February that his daughter had created “millions” of jobs. At the time he was referencing an effort from the workforce policy board to convince companies to pledge to offer “more than 6.5m training opportunities to workers over the next five years”, as the Washington Post pointed out.

Trump herself has also been misleading on the issue, saying in October that her efforts had led to “6.3m jobs.”

Many of these “jobs” are in fact training opportunities that have been pledged to be made available at some point over the next five years by various companies in a non-binding agreement and publicity move, which is nice, but nowhere close to the president’s lie that so many jobs have already been created."

In private, however, the President sounded “nervous and apprehensive” when he called a number of business leaders and financiers from his New Jersey golf club to get their opinions, the Washington Post reported.

Small wonder. With his personal-approval ratings stuck in the low forties, Trump’s 2020 reëlection campaign hinges on a healthy economy. He can be pretty confident that his core supporters will turn out for him, but he also needs to win over some less committed voters. His pitch to them is one that the British Conservative Party used successfully in 2015, during a general election, when it talked up the U.K. economy and issued dire warnings about the consequences of a victory for the opposition Labour Party.

One of the Conservatives’ campaign slogans was “DON’T LET LABOUR WRECK IT.” Substitute “THE DEMOCRATS” for “LABOUR” and you have Trump’s campaign strategy in a nutshell. Addressing a campaign rally in New Hampshire on Thursday night, he portrayed the Democratic candidates for President as “a bunch of socialists or communists” and asked the crowd, “Does anybody want to pay a ninety-five-per-cent tax?” He also suggested that a Democratic victory would lead to a crash in the stock market, adding, “You have no choice but to vote for me, because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes. Whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me.”

The mere fact that Trump’s strategy is based on scaremongering (under Barack Obama, the Dow more than doubled) and outright lies (Joe Biden is a socialist?) doesn’t mean that it can’t work. In 2015, the British economy wasn’t doing great at all. Held back by five years of Conservative austerity policies, it hadn’t even fully recovered from the Great Recession. But the Conservatives, aided by their allies in the British media, managed to raise enough doubts about Labour’s economic competence to gain an over-all majority in the House of Commons. As long as the U.S. economy looks strong, the possibility of something similar happening in November, 2020, can’t be ruled out entirely, despite Trump’s unpopularity.

But, if the economy turns south between now and the election, Trump will almost certainly be defeated, and he knows it. Hence his delay, earlier this week, on expanding tariffs on Chinese imports, and his increasingly frantic efforts to scapegoat the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell. As the Dow plunged on Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter, calling Powell “clueless” and retweeting guests on Fox Business who were criticizing the Fed’s recent policy moves.

In the two days since the big fall in the stock market, we’ve received some new economic data, and it has been mixed. On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales expanded by 0.7 per cent in July, the strongest figure since March. Economists responded by raising their estimates of third-quarter G.D.P. growth to about two per cent. That’s a long way short of the four-per-cent growth that Trump promised, but it’s also well above recession levels.

At the same time, the Fed confirmed that the manufacturing sector is in a slump. Manufacturing output fell 0.4 per cent in July, the central bank said, and it is now about 1.5 per cent below its December, 2018, level. For a President who promised to restore manufacturing to its former position of prominence, that can hardly be reassuring. Neither can the news, on Friday, that the University of Michigan’s survey-based index of consumer confidence fell sharply in August, reaching its lowest level since 2016.

The fall raised concerns about whether strong consumer spending will continue to underpin the economy, and it also illustrated that Trump’s aggressive tactics in the trade war are backfiring. “Consumers strongly reacted to the proposed September increase in tariffs on Chinese imports, spontaneously cited by 33% of all consumers in early August,” Richard Curtin, the chief economist at the Michigan survey, noted. The White House has now postponed the higher tariffs until December. That may reassure some consumers, but this week’s fluctuations in the stock market are likely to add to their jitters.

To be sure, none of this means that a recession is imminent. Most economists are predicting that the G.D.P. will continue to rise, albeit at a modest pace. Citing continued growth in jobs and household incomes, Curtain said “it is likely that consumers will reduce their pace of spending while keeping the economy out of recession at least through mid 2020.” The most recent statements from the Fed indicate that it agrees with this assessment.

As I pointed out a couple of days ago, though, economic predictions are often wrong, and nobody can be sure where things are heading. On Wall Street, there is a wide range of opinions, but there is also a general agreement that the risks of a serious downturn are rising. Ray Dalio, the head of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, said, on Wednesday, that there is a forty-per-cent chance of a recession before the election.

Despite all his bluster, Trump seems spooked. According to the Washington Post report, he has been “telling some confidants that he distrusts statistics he sees reported in the news media and that he suspects many economists and other forecasters are presenting biased data to thwart his reelection.” These sound like the ravings of an egomaniac who sees the world closing in on him."

It’s all part of an anti-Trump conspiracy, he rants, according to reports in The Post, the Associated Press and the New York Times.

And move over, Illuminati, because this particular conspiracy is massive.

It’s led by the Federal Reserve, Democrats and the media, of course, or so say Trump and his Fox News minions. But it also includes the entire U.S. bond market, which flashed a warning sign last week when the Treasury yield curve inverted (meaning long-term bonds had lower interest rates than short-term ones, which usually predates a downturn).

Also colluding are the many farmers, retailers, manufacturers and economists who have been warning for more than a year that the burden of Trump’s tariffs is mainly borne by Americans, not China or other trading partners, and also that uncertainty over trade tensions can paralyze hiring, investment and purchasing decisions, which we need to keep the economy expanding.

The cabal even transcends borders. Besides Trump’s trade wars, after all, the main risk to the U.S. economy involves contagion from abroad. And right now, nine major economies are either in a recession or on the verge of one. Never fear, though: All nine countries’ statisticians are surely cooking their books to hurt Trump, too.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway downplayed economic indicators signaling a possible future recession on Aug. 19. (Video: Reuters)

The White House has reportedly declined to develop contingency plans for a downturn because it doesn’t want to validate this “negative narrative.” This is, in a word, idiotic. As others have analogized, it’s like refusing to buy a fire extinguisher because you’re afraid of feeding a “negative narrative” that you might someday face a fire.

Administration officials decided the best way to deal with recession risk, which they of course aren’t personally worried about, was through a show of force on TV. There, Trump’s economic advisers assured Americans they definitely, certainly, cross-their-hearts-and-hope-to-die don’t see reason to worry.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro’s strategy was to deny that the data show Americans are paying higher prices on tariffed goods (though we are) and also that the yield curve had recently inverted (though it did). On that latter point, Navarro said the curve was merely “flat” and therefore doesn’t signal a possible recession. In virtually identical language across interviews, he told audiences that he had authority in this matter because he “didn’t write the book on the yield curve,” he wrote “several books on the efficacy of the yield curve as a leading economic indicator.”

What Navarro failed to mention, though, is that these books say that both inverted and “flat” yield curves are usually signs of impending recession. One such book, from 2006, explicitly mocked business leaders for failing to prepare for the 2001 recession because they had ignored “the ominous progression of the yield curve” that began with the curve’s flattening.

So, yeah, you can add mid-2000s-era Navarro to the list of anti-Trump conspirators, too.

Trump’s National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow hit the Sunday shows, too. For his part, he bizarrely pretended other troubling economic data (in this case, on consumer sentiment) didn’t exist. He also repeatedly told viewers: “Let’s not be afraid of optimism.”

And look, yes, it would be unhelpful for public officials to go on TV and tell everybody to panic, pull their money out of the market and stuff it under their mattresses. The White House obviously wants to project confidence instead.

But that confidence is convincing only if it’s credible — because, say, the White House has acknowledged how its own trade policies are contributing to recession risk and is committed to reversing them. Or because it has a competent team in place if recession strikes.

Neither is true.

Instead, Kudlow’s call for optimism has a whiff of Peter Pan logic about it: If only we believe in fairies hard enough, we can always save Tinker Bell — even when we’re sending her out into a hailstorm. If you believe, clap your hands; don’t let Tink die!

It’s hard to imagine nervous Americans are really this credulous. Then again, perhaps we were never the intended audience for such performances. Sure, maybe White House aides are trying to fool the public into believing recession warning signs don’t exist. But maybe they’re actually just trying to fool their boss.

A frightening conspiracy theory, indeed."

He’s vice president and managing director of the Lindsey Group, distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution and a CNN Economics Commentator. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Before President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the US economy was inching along with 1.5% growth. Many economists were so convinced the stagnation was here to stay that they called it the “new normal.” After the president took office and began pursuing his agenda’s three pillars of deregulation, tax cuts and trade reform, the “new normal” crowd said it couldn’t work.

Many of the same analysts now say we are headed for recession. There is, if nothing else, logical consistency in their position since they didn’t believe Trump’s economic plan would work in the first place.

To evaluate the odds of recession, however, it is essential to review the policy record’s effects, which we should expect to continue. It’s not surprising that policy pessimists are worried about a recession given their views of the impact of the president’s policies. But their pessimism is misplaced given the evidence.

Indeed, for the most part, things are working exactly as planned.

Start with deregulation. President Trump revolutionized regulatory practice when he came into office, giving agencies a regulatory budget. If they wanted to increase regulatory costs with a new regulation, they had to find something else to cut. And the successes have been impressive. For example, the 2017 Drug Competition Action Plan and subsequent reforms have led the Food and Drug Administration to approve dramatically more generic drugs, which has increased competition and helped push prices for prescription drugs 1.2% lower during the 12 months through February 2019.

In June, my last month as the chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, we published a detailed study of this and other deregulatory changes. We documented that reforms already enacted will raise real incomes by $3,100 per household over the next decade. Since deregulation continues, it is likely that the final benefit of this pillar of the administration’s economic policy will be much larger. Momentum, indeed.

As for corporate tax reform, the White House used economic models that predicted they would spur significant growth. Firms would build new factories, hire more workers and bid up wages.

Each of these effects happened as expected. While capital spending growth has slowed, the level of investment jumped after the tax cuts and stayed high. That has pushed up the growth in the amount of capital per worker, which has driven up productivity and wages. The bottom line for workers has, if anything, improved faster than the administration’s forecasts constructed during the tax debate. Since the tax cuts were passed, the typical household (of 2.5 people) has seen a $5,205 increase in real disposable personal income, according to calculations by the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers.

The administration came into office with a mandate to reform America’s trade deals to benefit our workers and our businesses. The status quo on trade left much room for improvement as President Trump took office. The president has already partially delivered on this promise. There is an improved U.S.-Korea Trade Agreement (KORUS) and an improved deal with our neighbors to the North and the South now in the hands of Congress. What is left is a major dispute with China, a dispute that seemed close to resolution in the spring, but now seems less so.

It may well be that the near-term costs of the dispute with China are a significant risk to the outlook, but the upside of successful reform is large as well. The rewards justify the risks. China’s theft of US intellectual property alone imposes, by some credible estimates, hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to the US economy per year. To put that in perspective, the largest property heist in US history was the approximately $500 million robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. When President Trump took office, China’s average take per day was about that much — between $225 billion and $600 billion annually, or about $500 million each day.

A nice way to summarize the current state of the economy and quantify the positive impact of the president’s policies is to compare the latest Congressional Budget Office economic outlook to the one it published in August of 2016. In 2016, the CBO thought that the unemployment rate for 2019 would be 4.8%.

It now thinks it will be 3.7%. The CBO thought that nearly 154 million Americans would have jobs this year; it now puts the number at 157 million — roughly 3 million jobs higher. It estimated in 2016 that nominal GDP this year would be $20.6 billion; it now places it at $21.4 billion, $800 million more GDP than expected.

To put the scale of these numbers in perspective, if a recession did arise, imposing job losses comparable to those that occurred in the 2001 recessions, American workers would still be better off than the CBO thought they would be looking ahead from 2016. The CBO, like other forecasters that underestimated the positive impact of recent policy changes, is calling for slowing growth in the future, but there is no reason to expect them to be more right in the future than they have been since 2016, assuming the president’s policies stay in place.

The world economy is slowing sharply, and the demand for US exports is a major negative for the outlook compared to a year ago. But the positive momentum from ongoing deregulation and the continuing impact of the tax cuts provide an insurance policy against recession, and President Trump’s policies have bought us that insurance policy."

The companies said Monday they will intervene in a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund against the administration, which is planning to roll back national pollution and gas mileage standards enacted while Barack Obama was president.

The group calls itself the “Coalition or Sustainable Automotive Regulation” and includes Nissan, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru, Isuzu, Suzuki, Maserati, McLaren, Aston-Martin and Ferrari.

Although the coalition opposes California’s right to set standards, it still wants Trump and the state to compromise on one national regulation.

“With our industry facing the possibility of multiple, overlapping and inconsistent standards that drive up costs and penalize consumers, we had an obligation to intervene,” said John Bozzella, CEO of Global Automakers and spokesman for the coalition.

The move puts the automakers at odds with four other companies — BMW, Ford, Volkswagen and Honda — which have decided to back California and endorse stricter emissions and fuel economy standards than Trump has proposed.

But the coalition’s stance is not so straightforward. For instance, although it opposes California’s right to set standards, it still wants President Donald Trump and the state to compromise on one national regulation.

Trump has proposed freezing the Obama-era standards at 2021 levels.

“There’s a middle ground that supports year-over-year increases in fuel economy,” and promotes electric cars and innovation, Bozzella said.

Automakers are taking sides because they want to know what regulations they’ll have to obey as they develop vehicles for future model years, said Alan Baum, a Detroit-area consultant who does work for the auto industry and environmental groups.

But they’re carefully trying not to antagonize customers who are for or against Trump, and they don’t want to alienate Wall Street investors who are against investing in technology that may not generate returns for several years, he said.

“Companies don’t want to take a political position because the color they care about is green, not red or blue,” Baum said.

GM, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota make more money off larger, less-efficient vehicles than most of their competitors, Baum said.

In September, Trump announced his administration would seek to revoke California’s congressionally granted authority to set standards that are stricter than those issued by federal regulators.

The move came after Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen signed a deal with the California Air Resources Board, the state’s air pollution regulator, which had been at odds with the Trump administration for months.

Many automakers have said in the past that they support increasing the standards, but not as much as those affirmed in the waning days of the Obama administration in 2016.

Under the Obama administration requirements, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average 30 mpg in real-world driving by 2021, rising to 36 mpg in 2025. Currently the standard is 26 mpg.

“Companies don’t want to take a political position because the color they care about is green, not red or blue.”

The Trump administration contends that freezing the fuel economy standards will reduce the average sticker price of new vehicles by about $2,700 by 2025, though that predicted savings is disputed by environmental groups and is more than double Environmental Protection Agency estimates from the Obama administration. The Trump administration says the freeze would increase safety by making newer, safer cars more affordable.

Environmental groups say the figures don’t include money consumers would save at the gas pump if cars got better mileage. A study released by Consumer Reports in August found that the owner of a 2026 vehicle will pay over $3,300 more for gasoline during the life of a vehicle if the standards are frozen at 2021 levels.

California’s authority to set its own, tougher emissions standards goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. In 2007, when Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, President George W. Bush’s administration denied California’s bid to place first-in-the-nation greenhouse gas limits on cars and trucks. But the state asked the EPA to reconsider its decision, and in 2009 — when Obama took office — the feds granted California’s request.

California has 35 million registered vehicles, the most of any state. A dozen other states and the District of Columbia follow California’s standards.

(AP) — President Donald Trump dismissed concerns of recession on Sunday and offered an optimistic outlook for the economy after last week’s steep drop in the financial markets.

“I don’t think we’re having a recession,” Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his New Jersey golf club. “We’re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut and they’re loaded up with money.”

A strong economy is key to Trump’s re-election prospects. Consumer confidence has dropped 6.4% since July. The president has spent most of the week at his golf club in New Jersey with much of his tweeting focused on talking up the economy.

Aides sought to reinforce that message during a series of appearances on the Sunday talk shows.

Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, dismissed fears of a looming recession and predicted the economy will perform well in the second half of 2019. He said that consumers are seeing higher wages and are able to spend and save more.

“We’re doing pretty darn well in my judgment. Let’s not be afraid of optimism,” Kudlow said.

Kudlow acknowledged a slowing energy sector, but said low interest rates will help housing, construction and auto sales.

Kudlow also defended the president’s use of tariffs on goods coming from China. Before he joined the administration, Kudlow was known for opposing tariffs and promoting free trade during his career as an economic analyst. Kudlow said Trump has taught him and others that the “China story has to be changed and reformed.”

“We cannot let China pursue these unfair and unreciprocal trading practices,” Kudlow said.

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said the U.S. needed to work with allies to hold China accountable on trade. He said he fears Trump is driving the global economy into a recession.

“This current trade war that the president has entered our country into is not working,” O’Rourke said. “It is hammering the hell out of farmers across this country.”

Last month, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark rate — which affects many loans for households and businesses — by a quarter-point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. It’s the first rate cut since December 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the Fed was worried about the consequences of Trump’s trade war and sluggish economies overseas.

“Weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy,” he said.

Breaking with historical norms, Trump has been highly critical of Powell as he places blame for any economic weakness on the nation’s central bank for raising interest rates too much over the past two years.

“I think I could be helped out by the Fed, but the Fed doesn’t like helping me too much,” Trump complained Sunday.

Peter Navarro, who advises Trump on trade policy, shared that sentiment.

“The Federal Reserve chairman should look in the mirror and say, ‘I raised rates too far, too fast, and I cost this economy a full percentage point of growth,'” Navarro said.

Trump acknowledged at least a potential impact on consumers when he paused a planned 10% tariff hike for many items coming from China, such as cellphones, laptops, video game consoles, some toys, computer monitors, shoes and clothing.

“We’re doing (it) just for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs could have an impact,” the president told reporters in New Jersey.

Navarro would not go even that far, saying Sunday “there’s no evidence whatsoever that Americans consumers are bearing any of this.”

Kudlow was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and “Fox News Sunday.” O’Rourke spoke on NBC, and Navarro appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Trump’s trade war with China has been a target of criticism by Democrats vying to challenge him in 2020.

“There is clearly no strategy for dealing with the trade war in a way that will actually lead to results for American farmers or American consumers,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, a Democratic presidential candidate. He said on CNN that it was “a fool’s errand” to think tariff increases will compel China to change its economic approach.

Trump maintained that China’s economy is struggling because of the tariffs and would like to make a trade deal with the U.S. He said he could make a “bad deal” and the stock markets would go up, “but it wouldn’t be the right thing to do.”

“I’m just not ready to make a deal yet,” Trump said. “China would like to make a deal. I’m not ready.”"

Trump defends economy in pitch to New Hampshire voters: 'You have no choice but to vote for me'

President Donald Trump spoke for around an hour and a half at Thursday’s New Hampshire campaign rally, running through a litany of topics, including talking up the economy amid growing concerns of a potential rescission, taking familiar jabs at 2020 Democrats and raising the issue of gun control despite not specifically mentioning any clear plan or measure.

But perhaps most noteworthy was what the president didn't say: No direct mention of Israel blocking Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib from entering the country.

However, the president did mention Omar briefly during his sprawling speech Thursday night in front of a raucous crowd at the SNHU Arena.

""They're all expanding. The steel industry is back. It's doing great. We're opening up mines in Minnesota, the great state of Minnesota, they're magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world,"" the president said, before mentioning the Democratic representative from Minnesota. ""And President Obama closed them down. Maybe we can get representative Omar from Minnesota to open them up. But I don't think so. She'll open them up, I don't think so. Rep. Omar, that's another one,"" Trump added, before quickly jumping back to talking trade policy.

And as stocks rebounded from the worst day on Wall Street this year and amid fears the United States might be inching closer to a recession in the coming months, the president still touted the economy. ""The United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world,"" the president said, adding that the markets went up ""thousands of points"" since he won the election.

The president's pitch to New Hampshire voters was simple Thursday night: Who else are you going to vote for?

""I know you like me and this room is a love fest. I know that, but you have no choice but to vote for me, because your 401(k)'s down the tubes, everything's going to be down the tubes,"" Trump said.

""If for some reason I wouldn't have won the election, these markets would have crashed, and that'll happen even more so in 2020,"" the president said.

Trump also took familiar jabs as his potential 2020 Democratic opponents.

The president ran down a list of candidates including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former Vice President Joe Biden, who received most of his venom.

""What about a sleepy Joe Biden rally? Right? Boy, he's made some beauties,"" the president said, referring to the former vice president's past gaffes. ""I sort of hope it’s him.""

""I don't mind any of them. You got Pocahontas is rising,"" Trump said, using the derogatory nickname he bestowed on Warren. ""You got Kamala, Kamala is falling. You got Beto. Beto is like, gone.""

The president, who delayed additional tariffs on certain Chinese goods this week, stated China was ""eating the tariffs"" and pushed claims that ""prices haven’t gone up."" But economists insist the China trade war has hit both sides as the tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports are passed on to American businesses and, through price increases, to U.S. consumers

He applauded farmers, who have been caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war as China has asked its importers to halt agriculture purchases.

""Our great farmers have been so incredible, because they've been targeted by China,"" the president said.

The president's latest ""Keep America Great"" rally marks what the Trump campaign said will be its first big step in ensuring what it couldn't do in 2016: Flip the Granite State red.

Losing New Hampshire in 2016 has appeared to be a sore spot for the president, but the reelection team said it's confident he will carry the state in 2020 despite potential indicators otherwise.

""New Hampshire is absolutely part of our winning strategy,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, told ABC News.

The campaign also hopes to flip New Mexico, Nevada, Minnesota and Oregon.

And the president's New Hampshire loss won't be the only 2016 relic hovering over the rally on Thursday: Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has said he's ""seriously considering"" a 2020 Senate run in the Granite State. And Lewandowski is set to travel on Air Force One Thursday for the rally, with rumors swirling about a possible announcement.

The president will make his case to voters in New Hampshire, a state with a serious independent streak, on the heels of ramping up divisive rhetoric and as critics and 2020 Democratic candidates have blamed that rhetoric for inspiring violence against minorities, including the recent massacre in El Paso, Texas.

And while the president lost New Hampshire by fewer than 3,000 votes, in 2020 it could be a taller task as Democrats have flipped the state's House and Senate since 2016.

The president's support remains underwater but steady in New Hampshire, with a 53% disapproval rating, a 42% approval rating contrasted and 5% unsure, according to a recent University of New Hampshire poll.

Trump's campaign said the president is banking on appealing to voters in New Hampshire by pushing for more manufacturing jobs and by touting steps he's taken toward battling the opioid epidemic, in addition to the economy.

""We are working to retain the supporters and voters that he had in 2016, and bring in new ones,"" Murtaugh said.

Just two weeks after winning in 2016 but losing New Hampshire, Trump tweeted that there was ""serious voter fraud"" there.

After taking office, the president created a short-lived Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity that found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to a former member of the Trump administration's now-disbanded commission.

The president's campaign declined to comment to ABC News when asked whether Trump still believes he lost the state because of voter fraud."

In August, Trump ordered U.S. companies to stop doing business with China and cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as the basis for his authority. Lawyers and analysts found his decision to invoke the law unprecedented.

“We have never seen any president use it as leverage in a trade dispute with another country,” Judith A. Lee, co-chair of the International Trade Practice Group at the law firm Gibson Dunn, told Marketplace.

New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice has identified 123 statutory powers the president can use if he declares a national emergency, with IEEPA being the most widely used.

“IEEPA alone gives the president a massive amount of control over the economy,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at the Brennan Center. “If you add them up, and if you assume generous interpretations and aggressive creativity like we’ve seen from this administration in the past, that could give the president some pretty substantial economic powers.”

While Goitein said executive branch lawyers have been familiar with the various laws for a long time, she noted, “I think educating the public — and frankly even lawmakers, a little bit — about what powers are available levels the playing field.”

Along with these emergency powers, various trade acts throughout history also give Trump the ability to control tariffs on goods imported from other countries. Here are some of the laws that Trump can use to carry out his economic agenda.

Trump’s influence over travel

If Trump declares there’s a national emergency, he can invoke 49 U.S. Code § 114, a statute that allows the head of the Transportation Security Administration (under the direction of the secretary of Homeland Security) to “coordinate domestic transportation,” which includes surface transportation, like airline and railroad travel, along with maritime transportation.

“It could be potentially used to get rid of emission standards for vehicles or subsidize transportation [in] a favored industry,” Goitein said. “Altering emissions standards would have the net effect of ‘coordinating’ transportation in a certain way, but it would be an extremely indirect way to do it.”

Goitein noted that even though this would be a very “creative” interpretation of the statute, these are still possibilities you have to consider. For her, a more typical interpretation of this language might be, hypothetically, if there were a terrorist threat made to Amtrak, and the administration had to shut down transportation or reroute traffic away from areas that were threatened.

The Trump administration has already attempted to roll back emissions standards, announcing a plan in August to revoke an Obama-era environmental regulation that mandates automakers try to make cars substantially more fuel efficient.

Agricultural tariffs

When it comes to agricultural products, the president has the ability to impose fees and limit imports when there’s a national emergency under 7 U.S. Code § 624 without having to wait for recommendations from the International Trade Commission.

“He can use that as a kind of protective tariff,” Goitein said.

A “forgotten” tariff law

Another untapped power the president has comes from Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, according to a paper from the law firm Covington & Burling, co-authored by John Veroneau and Catherine Gibson.

Veroneau, a partner at the firm, said that Section 338 gives the president broad authority to impose or raise tariffs if U.S. companies or interests are being discriminated against. In such cases, the president can impose additional duties of up to 50% of the product’s value and also block imports from that country if it continues to discriminate against U.S. goods.

Even though presidents have the ability to wield this statute, it’s gone unused for decades. The last public record that Veroneau and Gibson found related to the statute dates back to 1949, when the U.S. secretary of state sent a telegram to Shanghai’s consul mentioning 338 “as a possible response to discrimination by China against American trade.”

This current administration has instead retaliated against China with tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and also imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

Veroneau said that if Section 301 is used to address unfair trade practices, then that very rationale meets the criteria of Section 338. However, he added that unlike Section 301, Section 338 does not require the Office of the United States Trade Representative to perform a formal investigation.

“I would argue it’s, in some ways, more broad than Section 301,” he said.

While Trump can use this power, Veroneau and Gibson noted in their paper that their “raising awareness of this tariff authority is not a call for its use,” and that World Trade Organization members would “certainly” try to challenge it.

Money for national defense

The president also has the ability to “create, maintain, protect, expand or restore domestic industrial base capabilities essential for the national defense” under 50 U.S. Code § 4533.

Trump can use this statute whether or not he declares a national emergency. However, the declaration of one would enable him to waive some of the restrictions on this authority.

“Essentially, he can choose to put government money behind any industry or industries that fall into broad parameters, such as industrial resources, technology, materials and production capabilities,” Goitein said.

Protecting the coal industry

The president can “authorize an agency to guarantee loans by private institutions in order to finance products and services essential to the national defense” using 50 U.S. Code § 4531 in the event of a national emergency.

“You could see that as being a way to ensure, basically, the subsidizing of a range of industries that otherwise might have trouble,” Goitein said. “Subsidizing things like coal, for example.”

Coal, of course, is a struggling industry that Trump wants to revive. In the past, he’s said his team was preparing to lift restrictions on American energy and put coal miners back to work."

The public’s agenda for the president and Congress is only modestly different from a year ago, but it reflects a continued evolution of the national agenda.

Improving the economy (70% top priority) remains among the public’s highest priorities, but its prominence has waned significantly in recent years. In 2011, following the Great Recession, 87% called it a top priority. And as public ratings of the employment situation have grown increasingly positive, 50% now say improving the job situation should be a top priority; in each of the previous 10 years, majorities cited jobs as a top priority, including 84% who said this in 2011 and 68% who said this as recently as 2017.

Most (67%) continue to say defending the country from future terrorist attacks is a top priority, though this is one of the lowest shares citing the issue since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and far lower than the roughly eight-in-ten who called it a top priority through much of the early to mid-2000s.

As economic and security concerns have become less prominent, the domestic issues of reducing health care costs (69% top priority) and improving the educational system (68%) now rank among the top tier of public priorities. About two-thirds also say that taking steps to make the Social Security (67%) and Medicare (67%) systems financially sound are top priorities for the country.

One issue that’s not a major concern for the public: taking steps to reduce the budget deficit. Just 48% say reducing the deficit should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year. Concern over the budget deficit is much less widespread than it was during Barack Obama’s administration. In 2013, 72% of the public – including 81% of Republicans and 65% of Democrats – said reducing the deficit should be a top priority.

The Pew Research Center survey, conducted Jan. 9-14 among 1,505 adults, finds that Republicans and Democrats continue to stake out markedly different priorities for the country.

Majorities of both parties place top priority on strengthening the economy, but a significantly larger share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (79%) than Democrats and Democratic leaners (64%) say this.

The pattern is the reverse when it comes to reducing health care costs, improving the educational system and taking steps to make the Medicare system financially sound; in all three cases, larger majorities of Democrats than Republicans call these issues top priorities for the country.

Partisans are even further apart when it comes to defending the country from future terrorist attacks: A large majority of Republicans (83%) calls this a top priority for the country, compared with a about half of Democrats (53%). And while most Republicans place top priority on strengthening the military (65%) and dealing with immigration (68%), fewer than half of Democrats say the same.

By contrast, a majority of Democrats (71%) place the highest priority on dealing with the problems of poor and needy people, compared with 49% of Republicans.

When it comes to the environment, Democrats are 43 percentage points more likely than Republicans to say protecting the environment should be a top priority (74% vs. 31%) and 46 points more likely to call global climate change a top priority (67% vs. 21%).

Taking steps to make the Social Security system financially sound is one of the only issues where comparable majorities of Republicans (68%) and Democrats (65%) say this should be a top priority for the country.

As the public stakes out its agenda for the president and Congress, Americans increasingly see a big difference in what the two parties stand for. For the first time since the question was first asked more than two decades ago, more than half (54%) now say there is a great deal of difference in what the Democratic and Republican parties stand for, compared with smaller shares who say there is a fair amount of difference (30%) or hardly any (13%). The share that sees a great deal of difference between the two parties is up from 45% who said this in 2015 and from just 35% who said this in 2007.

In a divided Washington, the public has low expectations for partisan cooperation in the coming year. About seven-in-ten (71%) think Republicans and Democrats in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year; just 21% expect them to work together more than usual. This is one of the most pessimistic year-ahead outlooks over the past several administrations, matching the 71% who expected more partisan opposition in 2015, following the 2014 midterm elections. Majorities of both Republicans (78%) and Democrats (67%) think partisans in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year.

While the public expects greater discord between two parties they view as far apart, rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats see their own parties as united. Overall, 55% of Republicans and Republican leaners describe the GOP as mostly united on issues and its vision for the future.

This marks a major shift from October of 2017, when most Republicans (63%) said their party was divided.

Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 63% describe the Democratic Party as united in its views on issues and vision for the future; in the fall of 2017, 56% said this.

Economic issues are now lower priorities for Republicans and Democrats

Strengthening the economy continues to rank as a top issue for 70% of the public overall – including nearly eight-in-ten Republicans (79%) and 64% of Democrats. While little changed from last year, both parties are now considerably less likely to cite the economy as a top priority than they were in the years following the Great Recession. In 2013, 87% of both Republicans and Democrats said improving the economy should be a top priority.

Over the past year, the importance of improving the job situation has declined among both Republicans and Democrats. A year ago, 66% of Republicans and Republican leaners said improving the job situation was a top priority for Congress and the president. Today, roughly half say this (52%) – a 14 percentage point drop.

There has been a more modest decline in the share of Democrats citing jobs as a top priority: 50% now say this, down from 58% a year ago.

Wide partisan gap over importance of strengthening military

Today, 83% of Republicans and Republican leaners say defending the country from future terrorist attacks should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year. By contrast, only about half of Democrats (53%) say the same.

The share of Republicans giving top priority to defending the country from terror attacks has not changed much in recent years, but the share of Democrats saying this has declined significantly. In 2017, for instance, about seven-in-ten Democrats (72%) viewed defending the country from future terrorist attacks as a top priority for the president and Congress.

As has been the case for the last several years, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say strengthening the U.S. military should be a top priority: 65% of Republicans say this, compared with 31% of Democrats.

Long-term changes in the public’s priorities

The public’s priorities have shifted over time and many issues are viewed differently today than they were at different moments over the past decade.

Economic issues have declined as top priorities for the public over the last several years. The share viewing “improving the job situation”

as a top priority has fallen 34 percentage points since 2011 – and 12 points since last year alone.

Strengthening the nation’s economy and reducing the budget deficit have also declined in the last eight years, although less sharply.

The share saying global climate change should be prioritized has increased substantially since 2011; then, just 26% of Americans said it should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Today, 44% say it should be a top priority.

Other issues that are given greater priority today than in 2011 include reducing health care costs, dealing with the problems of poor and needy people, protecting the environment and improving transportation infrastructure.

Public expects more partisan division in 2019

The public takes a deeply pessimistic view of the prospects for partisan cooperation in the coming year. About seven-in-ten (71%) say they think Republicans and Democrats in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year; far fewer (21%) think they will work together to solve problems more than usual.

The share that expects greater partisan opposition in Washington is 10 points higher than it was in January 2017, following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. It matches a high of 71% from January 2015, following the 2014 midterm elections.

Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (78%) expect partisans in Washington to bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year. A slightly smaller majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (67%) also take this view.

Views of the parties’ ideological directions

Looking ahead, most Republicans want to see their party move in a more conservative direction. Nearly six-in-ten Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters (58%) say they want the GOP to move in a more conservative direction, compared with 38% who want it to move in a more moderate direction. Republican views on their preferred ideological direction for the party are about the same as they have been following other recent midterm and presidential elections.

Among Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, somewhat more say they want the Democratic Party to move in a more moderate (53%) than more liberal (40%) direction. These views are about the same as they were following the 2014 midterm elections. In November 2016, after Trump’s presidential election victory, a somewhat greater share of Democrats (49%) wanted the party to head in a more liberal direction.

Favorability ratings of the Republican and Democratic parties

The Democratic Party continues to receive slightly higher favorability ratings than the Republican Party – though neither party is rated favorably by more than half of the public.

Overall, 49% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, compared with about as many (47%) who hold an unfavorable view. Ratings of the Democratic Party have ticked down from September of last year (53%) but are comparable to where they have been at other points in the recent past.

Views of the Republican Party tilt negative, on balance: 54% hold an unfavorable view of the GOP, while 42% view the party favorably. Ratings of the Republican Party have changed little in recent years."

Over the weekend, he pointed to mental illness as a likely culprit behind recent shootings in Odessa, Texas, and elsewhere, even though criminologists routinely point to gun ownership as a far better predictor of public mass shootings than indicators of mental illness. There were no immediate indications Sunday that mental illness contributed to the shootings that killed 7 and injured 22 others in Texas, a state with one of the most lenient gun control laws.

Trump also repeatedly marveled over Hurricane Dorian’s size, incorrectly telling the public about its potential path and suggesting he’s never heard of a “category 5” storm before. Dorian, in fact, is the fourth category 5 storm to happen under his watch.

The claims capped a week of distortion by Trump on various fronts, from the economy to Iran and North Korea.

A review:

HURRICANE DORIAN

TRUMP: “In addition to Florida – South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.” — tweet Sunday.

TRUMP: “The original course was dead into Florida. Now it seems to be going up toward South Carolina, toward North Carolina. Georgia’s going to be hit. Alabama’s going to get a piece of it, it looks like.” — remarks to reporters Sunday.

THE FACTS: Trump goes astray in warning of trouble for Alabama, which is expected to be spared. As of Sunday, the National Hurricane Center forecast Dorian to be 40 to 50 miles (64 to 80 kilometers) off the Florida coast on Tuesday and Wednesday, with hurricane-force wind speeds extending about 35 miles (56 kilometers) to the west.

“Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,” tweeted the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama. “We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.”

Few, if any, meteorologists put Alabama in its path.

Asked if Trump had been briefed about the impact to Alabama, Christopher Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in an email: “The current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.”

___

TRUMP: “I’m not sure that I’ve ever even heard of a category 5. I knew it existed and I’ve seen some category 4′s. You don’t even see them that much. But a category 5 is something that I don’t know that I’ve ever even heard the term other than I know it’s there.” — remarks Sunday at FEMA headquarters.

THE FACTS: In his third hurricane season as president, Trump has had plenty of exposure to category 5 storms.

He made the same claim two years ago, saying he wasn’t aware of category 5 storms until Hurricane Irma. “In Florida, you got hit with the strongest winds ever recorded. It actually hit the Keys with a_it was a Category 5. I never even knew a Category 5 existed,” Trump said in September 2017.

Since then, he’s repeatedly marveled about the size of the storms — and by extension, his administration’s response to it — including category 5 hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, Michael in 2018 and now Dorian.

Having four category 5 hurricanes in three years is actually more than any other president in history. George W. Bush had eight such hurricanes in eight years. Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan only had one during their two terms in office, while George H.W. Bush had two in four years and Carter had three in four years.

___

TRUMP, on hurricane aid: “Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for ‘anywhere.’” — tweet Tuesday.

TRUMP, on Puerto Rico: “Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten.” — tweet Wednesday.

THE FACTS: His figure of $92 billion is wrong, as is his assertion that the U.S. territory has set some record for federal disaster aid. Congress has so far distributed only about $14 billion for Puerto Rico.

It’s a false claim he’s made repeatedly. The White House has said the estimate includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $42.7 billion approved.

That $50 billion in additional money, however, is speculative. It is based on Puerto Rico’s eligibility for federal emergency disaster funds for years ahead, involving calamities that haven’t happened.

That money would require future appropriations by Congress.

Even if correct, $92 billion would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost the U.S government more than $120 billion — the bulk of it going to Louisiana.

Trump frequently inflates and complains about the amount of disaster aid that Congress “foolishly gave” Puerto Rico after the deadly destruction from Hurricane Maria in 2017. He has talked as if he doesn’t recognize the U.S. territory as American and, in an April tweet, said Puerto Rico officials “only take from USA.”

Hurricane Dorian inflicted limited damage in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands before intensifying on its track toward the U.S. mainland.

___

GUN VIOLENCE

TRUMP, addressing the mass shooting in Odessa, Texas: “For the most part, sadly, if you look at the last four or five going back … five or six or seven years for the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it. So it’s a big problem. It’s a mental problem.” — remarks Sunday.

TRUMP: “Our goal must be to identify severely disturbed individuals and disrupt their plans before they strike.” — remarks Sunday at FEMA headquarters.

THE FACTS: He’s oversimplifying the role of mental illness in public mass shootings and minimizing the ease with which Americans can get firearms. There was no immediate indication Sunday that mental illness was a factor in shootings in Texas.

Most people with mental illness in fact are not violent, and they are far more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators.

A country’s rate of gun ownership is a far better predictor of public mass shootings than indicators of mental illness, said Adam Lankford, a University of Alabama criminologist who published a 2016 analysis of data from 171 countries.

“The key of what’s going on here is access to guns for people who are dangerous or disturbed,” Lankford said. Red flag laws make it easier to disarm people believed to be a danger to themselves or others, “but sometimes there are not clear warning signs or those signs are not reported to the authorities until after an attack,” he said.

Last month, the U.S. Secret Service released a report on mass public attacks in 2018, finding that “no single profile” can be used “to predict who will engage in targeted violence” and “mental illness, alone, is not a risk factor.”

Trump has offered contradictory messages in reacting to recent mass shootings. Days after the El Paso shooting last month, he said he was eager to implement “very meaningful background checks” on guns and told reporters there was “tremendous support” for action. He later backed away, saying the current system of background checks was “very, very strong.”

___

ECONOMY

TRUMP: “On this very day — I just saw a number — almost 160 million people are working. The most ever in the history of our country. I mean, we have incredible numbers.” — remarks to reporters Friday.

THE FACTS: He’s correct, but that’s only because of population growth.

A more relevant measure is the proportion of Americans with jobs, and that is still far below record highs.

According to Labor Department data, 60.7% of people in the United States 16 years and older were working in July. That’s below the all-time high of 64.7% in April 2000, though higher than the 59.9% when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017.

___

TRUMP: “General Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?” — tweet Friday.

THE FACTS: That’s inaccurate on several counts.

Still a giant, GM did not close factories in the U.S. and move them to China. It set up and expanded operations in China primarily to serve that market.

And by many measures, it is the largest U.S. automaker. The company made more money last year than crosstown rivals Fiat Chrysler and Ford, and GM sold more vehicles in the U.S. than the other two.

It remains the largest Michigan-headquartered employer in the state, with a workforce of 52,000 outpacing that of Ford, the state government and Fiat Chrysler, according to an analysis this year by Crain’s Detroit Business. In southeast Michigan, it was No. 2, behind Ford, and ahead of Fiat Chrysler.

___

NORTH KOREA

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: “Watching those 55 small, flag-draped caskets come off the plane was an extraordinary experience. We brought back — we brought back our heroes, and there’s more to come.” — remarks Wednesday to the American Legion veterans group.

THE FACTS: No remains of U.S. service members have been returned since last summer and the U.S. suspended efforts in May to get negotiations on the remains back on track in time to have more repatriated this year. The U.S. hopes more remains may be brought home next year.

The Pentagon’s Defense POW-MIA Accounting Agency, which is responsible for recovering U.S. war remains and returning them to families, “has not received any new information from (North Korean) officials regarding the turn over or recovery of remains,” spokesman Charles Prichard said last month.

He said his agency is “still working to communicate” with the North Korean army “as it is our intent to find common ground on resuming recovery missions” in 2020.

Last year, in line with the first summit between Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un that June, the North turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of U.S. service members killed in the North during the 1950-53 war. So far, six Americans have been identified from the 55 boxes.

U.S. officials have said the North has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of American war remains. Thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former POW camps.

The Pentagon estimates that 5,300 Americans were lost in North Korea.

___

TRUMP on North Korea’s leader: “With respect to North Korea — Kim Jong-un, who I’ve got to know extremely well, the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong-un and I think she’d agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” — news conference on Aug. 26 with French President Emmanuel Macron.

THE FACTS: Melania Trump doesn’t know Kim. They have never met.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham clarified the president’s comment, saying Trump confides in his wife on his relationship with Kim and “feels like she’s gotten to know him, too.”

___

IRAN

TRUMP on Iran: “We gave them $150 billion and $1.8 billion and we got nothing. … Look at what they did to John Kerry and to President Obama. Look what happened, where they’re bringing planeloads of cash, planeloads, big planes, 757s, Boeing 757s coming in loaded up with cash. What kind of a deal is that?” — news conference with Macron.

THE FACTS: It’s the kind of deal that did not actually take place.

When Iran signed the multinational deal to restrain its nuclear development in return for being freed from sanctions, it regained access to its own assets, which had been frozen abroad. There was no $150 billion gift from the U.S. treasury or other countries. Iran was allowed to get its money back.

The $1.8 billion refers to a separate matter, also misstated by Trump going back to before the 2016 election.

A payout of roughly that amount did come from the U.S. treasury. It was to pay an old IOU.

In the 1970s, Iran paid the U.S. $400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured. After the nuclear deal, the U.S. and Iran announced they had settled the matter, with the U.S. agreeing to pay the $400 million principal along with about $1.3 billion in interest.

The $400 million was paid in cash and flown to Tehran on a cargo plane. The arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later.

In Trump’s telling, one cargo plane with $400 million that was owed to Iran has become “big planes, 757s, Boeing 757s,” loaded with a $1.8 billion giveaway. Kerry was then secretary of state.

___

CLEAN AIR

TRUMP: “We’re, right now, having the cleanest air and cleanest water on the planet.” — remarks on Aug. 26 with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

THE FACTS: That’s not true. Air quality hasn’t improved under the Trump administration and dozens of nations have less smoggy air than the U.S.

Water? One measure, Yale University’s global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water.

But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. Over the last two years the U.S. had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier, federal data show.

There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when the U.S had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980.

The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days.

The nonprofit Health Effects Institute’s State of Global Air 2019 report ranked the United States 37th dirtiest out of 195 countries for ozone, also known as smog, worse than the global average for population-weighted pollution. Countries such as Britain, Japan, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Albania, Cuba, Russia, Vietnam, New Zealand and Canada have less smoggy air.

The U.S. ranks eighth cleanest on the more deadly category of fine particles in the air.

On environmental quality overall, the Yale index put the U.S. 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1.

___

ENERGY

TRUMP: “I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I’ve made that wealth come alive. … We are now the number one energy producer in the world.” — news conference with Macron.

THE FACTS: Sole credit to himself is not accurate. The greatest energy revolution of the past half-century happened on Obama’s watch as U.S. petroleum and natural gas production achieved preeminence.

In 2013, the U.S. became the world’s top producer both of natural gas and petroleum hydrocarbons, says the government’s U.S. Energy Information Administration. As for crude oil specifically, the agency says the U.S. became the world’s top crude oil producer last year. That is largely attributed to the shale oil boom that began late in George W. Bush’s administration and proceeded apace during the Obama years.

The boom came because of fracking and other technology, such as horizontal drilling, that made it possible to find much more oil and gas without drilling more holes. As well, Obama lifted a decades-long ban on shipping U.S. oil overseas in 2015, helping increase demand for U.S. crude.

___

TRUMP, on addressing climate change: “I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. … I’m not going to lose it on dreams, on windmills, which frankly aren’t working too well.” — news conference with Macron.

THE FACTS: In criticizing wind power, Trump misidentified his target. Wind turbines produce energy. Windmills mill grain and flummox Don Quixote.

Trump has ascribed a variety of evils to wind power over the years, usually with scant evidence, while praising coal, a well-documented cause of health problems.

Associated Press writers Cal Woodward, Robert Burns, Jill Colvin, Josh Boak and Michael Biesecker in Washington and Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report."
172,"'Give me some of that money,' Trump tells Fed in speech on the economy - NBC News","'Give me some of that money,' Trump tells Fed in speech on the economy  NBC News","Tue, 12 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vjb25vbXkvZ2l2ZS1tZS1zb21lLW1vbmV5LXRydW1wLXRlbGxzLWZlZC1zcGVlY2gtZWNvbm9teS1uMTA4MDc2NtIBLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL25jbmExMDgwNzY2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"President Donald Trump touted the country's economic progress Tuesday, highlighting job growth and a robust manufacturing sector, while also blaming the Federal Reserve for stunting the nation's stock market successes.

The Fed raised rates too quickly and was too slow to cut them, said Trump in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. He also pushed for negative rates, noting that other countries ""openly cut interest rates so that many are now actually getting paid when they pay off their loan,"" Trump said. “Give me some of that. Give me some of that money. I want some of that money. Our Federal Reserve doesn’t let us do it.”

Since the 2016 election, the S&P 500 is up by 45 percent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by around 50 percent, and the Nasdaq is up by 60 percent, Trump said. But, while he praised those stock market gains, he noted that ""if the Fed had worked with us, those numbers could have been higher by 25 percent.""

Trump was scheduled after the speech to participate in a roundtable and a fundraising reception for supporters, where he is widely expected to defer a decision on slapping tariffs on European cars for another six months, setting up a potential showdown between the U.S. and the European Union six months before the 2020 election.

Market observers expect him to touch on trade — both the auto tariffs as well as the ongoing trade war with China, a situation where last week’s promise of a truce has now been thrown into question.

Jamie Cox, managing partner of the Harris Financial Group, said investors have baked in the expectation of another deferral on the European car tariff decision. “Markets are fine with the status quo. If the tariff situation stays where it is and doesn’t escalate, the market can handle it,” he said.

Cox added that intervention from the Federal Reserve has prevented more drastic trade-related market volatility. ""A lot of the negative impact has been extinguished by reducing interest rates,” Cox said.

“Trump probably still believes tariffs are good, but he’s also cautious in terms of the economic cycle,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, think tank in Brussels, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The reality is probably sinking in for him that trade wars are not good for the U.S. economy.”

The decision on auto tariffs has already been postponed for six months, and the issue has been casting a shadow over the economies of export-dependent companies such as Germany since May of last year, when the White House ordered a “232” investigation to determine if the U.S. could slap tariffs on European cars on the grounds that they pose a threat to national security.

“The Trump administration embraces a broad interpretation of ‘national security,’” said Dean A. Pinkert, partner at the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed and a former commissioner of the U.S. International Trade Commission.

“It gives a lot of weight to economic welfare as a factor in determining whether to impose national security tariffs. In addition, specifically with regard to auto tariffs under Section 232, the administration has shown a willingness to use the threat of tariffs to achieve market access concessions from U.S. trading partners,” Pinkert said. “I’m expecting continued negotiations.”

The prospect of a postponement without resolution isn’t likely to bring the same sense of relief on the other side of the Atlantic, though.

“That’s both good news and bad news,” Véron said. While the good news is that the E.U. won’t face tariffs, “it’s not unqualified good news for Europe,” he added.

“The bad news is the issue is not going away and will come back in six months’ time,” Véron said. “That will remain as a dark cloud over the European economy, which is unfortunate at the moment,” since many are already concerned that the bloc’s economy could slip into a recession.

Unlike the trade war with China, wading into a tariff battle with Europe would hurt both sides with little to show for it, experts said.

“Employing a tariff on a European auto manufacturer wouldn’t be very effective because most of the European auto manufacturers already employ Americans,” Cox said, pointing out that much of this production is concentrated in Southern states that are key to Trump’s re-election bid. “And the retaliatory component of that could be worse,” he added.

“There’s not much political support for tariffs on European autos, and consumers would be directly hurt,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

There is evidence that the existing tariffs are already reaching into consumers’ wallets: A survey by market research firm CivicScience found that, as of last month, a full two-thirds of Americans were worried about the impact of the Trump administration’s trade policies and tariffs on their household expenses. One quarter said they were buying less because prices had gone up, up from 10 percent in June, and the percentage of respondents who said they didn’t notice a difference dropped 9 percentage points over that same time frame.

Experts say the looming 2020 election is probably a key driver of Trump’s decision-making at present. “Clearly, Trump is concerned about the economy. He doesn’t want to create too much damage,” Véron said.

“Fighting two tariff wars at once might appeal to Trump’s base, but his base isn’t big enough to re-elect him,” Shepherdson said."

It’s not hard to demonstrate all the soft spots in the economy that Trump keeps bragging about. What’s hard is to predict the political effect.

Normally, incumbent presidents get re-elected when the economy is strong. A Yale economist named Ray Fair has even reduced this tendency to a mathematic model, with surprisingly good predictive power.

But this is neither a normal president nor a normal economic boom. For starters, though wage growth is finally ticking upward, ordinary workers have nothing like the bargaining power they used to enjoy in an economy with unemployment as low as 3.5 percent. The shift to gig work and other precarious forms of employment continues unabated.

Housing continues to be unaffordable for more and more Americans, while college debt cripples the ability of young families to qualify for mortgage loans. Subjectively, the real economy as experienced by real people just isn’t that strong.

And while very low interest rates contribute to a high-flying stock market, most Americans don’t own stock. But those same low interest rates are contributing to new financial bubbles.

Trump’s tax cuts did not lead to an increase in corporate investment. Mainly, they accelerated stock buybacks, the better to pump up stock prices.

Global growth is also slowing. Trump’s trade war has been suspended for now, but America's trade deficit with China is bigger than ever.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that more and more homeowners are refinancing their home mortgages at higher rates than their existing mortgages to take out money to live on. As in the run-up to the 2008 collapse, household debt is substituting for household income. This is just not sustainable.

All of this suggests an over-leveraged economy, which could be cruising for a crash. But will the crash come in time for the 2020 election?

Sorry, but my crystal ball is just not that good. If it were, I’d be in the South of France instead of here writing this post."

Fewer are giving the president credit for the economy. Forty-seven percent approve of Donald Trump’s handling of the economy and 51% disapprove, not significantly different from January, when 44% approved and 55% disapproved.

Fewer approve of Trump’s handling of trade and taxes. Twenty-six percent say Trump’s tariffs help the national economy, down from 40% in August 2018, a change that is largely driven by Republicans. Few Americans (17%) say they paid less in federal taxes in 2018 compared with 2017.

While few Americans expect the direction of the country or the economy to improve over the next year, the public is less pessimistic than it was in January. Forty-four percent expect things in the country to deteriorate over the next year; in January, 52% said things would get worse. Thirty-four percent say the economy will get worse in the next year, down from 44% in January.

As usual, there are large differences between the views of Republicans and Democrats. Republicans are much more likely to approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, trade, and taxes than are Democrats or independents.

Fifty percent of Americans regard free trade agreements with other countries as beneficial to the United States economy, while 17% say they are bad for the economy.

However, fewer see tariffs as advantageous to the economy, even among Republicans. Just 26% of Americans say Trump’s tariffs will help the economy, down from 40% in August 2018. And, while 50% of Republicans think the tariffs will be beneficial to the national economy, this is down from 70% in August of 2018. Only 19% of Americans say Trump’s tariffs will help their local community, and just 15% say tariffs will help their friends and family.

Overall, 70% think Trump’s tariffs will increase the price of consumer goods in the United States, while only 8% expect consumer goods to cost less and 20% think the tariffs will have no effect.

Those who say they approve of Trump’s overall job performance are less likely to say that tariffs will increase the cost of consumer goods in the United States than are those who disapprove (64% vs 75%). Education also plays into perceived tariff effect. College graduates are more likely than those without a degree to say tariffs will increase prices (84% vs. 63%).

Thirty-three percent of Americans say their federal taxes from 2018 increased, and 31% say their taxes stayed the same, while 17% say their 2018 tax bill was lower than 2017. Fifty percent say they received a refund on their 2018 federal tax return, and 19% owed additional taxes.

The nationwide poll was conducted June 13-17, 2019, using the AmeriSpeak® Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,116 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points."

""It is something that I'm thinking about,"" he told reporters at the White House.

Moments later, he seemed to dismiss the idea that the economy would have any need for that dramatic an emergency measure. ""We’re very far from a recession,"" he said.

Trump sought for a seventh day Tuesday to calm fears about the economy, brushing off talk of a recession and defending his decision to take on China, as real anxiety mounted inside the White House over how to end a trade war that risks dragging the U.S. into a recession during an election year.

The president showed little indication of lightening up on his standoff with China, even at the expense of hurting the U.S. in the short term. He blamed his predecessors for not having addressed China's unfair economic practices and leaving it to him, and once again attributed a cooling in the economy to the Federal Reserve.

""Someone has to take China on,"" Trump told reporters during a meeting with the Romanian president. ""Whether it is good or bad for our country short term, it is bad for our country long term. Whether good or bad short term is irrelevant.""

But despite Trump's public reassurances on the economy and resolve on China, inside the White House there was growing acknowledgement that the trade war with China risked dragging down the U.S. economy.

While reaching a deal with Beijing was always seen as important for Trump’s 2020 chances, the warning signs flashing on the economy and an 800-point tumble in the Dow last week have given advisers a jolt, White House aides said.

Trump's advisers have told him to focus his message on the signs of strength in the economy, like low unemployment, and avoid tying his success to the stock market, which the president has publicly used as an EKG of his presidency, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Meanwhile, the White House has sent out a full-court press of surrogates to push back against warnings from economists that a recession is looming, as the president himself sent out a flurry of retweets echoing the message Tuesday morning.

""Sorry to disappoint Democrats, but the economy has never been stronger!"" said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale in a message retweeted by the president that accused news organizations of ""cheering for the economy to tank."" Trump later retweeted a supporter who said he ""has this Economy humming like a fine tuned engine.""

Trump’s advisers have been divided on how hard to push China on a deal, said people familiar with the talks. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, whose main focus has been on the stock market and short-term economic indicators, has been a proponent of reaching some kind of agreement while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have taken a harder line on China, seeing the global security risk the country poses.

Vice President Mike Pence, who has pushed for a deal to include human rights concessions, increasingly sees a need for a deal, said one White House aide. Pence is the main point person in the administration for those in agriculture states, where farmers are being badly hurt by the trade war.

That division has contributed to the White House sending mixed signals on how badly the U.S. wants a deal.

Trump said last week he would delay $156 billion in tariffs because he didn’t want to hurt U.S. consumers during the holiday shopping season, while allowing an additional $100 billion in tariffs to go forward next month. He has also put off making a decision on whether to grant Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies, which he has described as a national security risk, a 90-day extension to buy parts from its U.S. suppliers.

Now there is the risk that economic fears in the U.S. could give China greater leverage in negotiations — warnings that if the U.S. doesn’t lift the tariffs China will continue to retaliate through the election. China has already put retaliatory tariffs in place and earlier this month stopped buying U.S. agriculture products.

Trump has to walk a political fine line on China — and not just because of the economy, said one White House aide. He has repeatedly vilified the country to his base of supporters, blaming it for the loss of manufacturing jobs, and recent protests in Hong Kong has highlighted China’s human rights abuses. If Trump is seen as making a deal just for the sake of ending the trade war without getting significant concessions from China, he could be seen as going soft on Beijing.

“President Trump’s base, and many other Americans, have long been uncomfortable with China's growing power,” Christopher Wilson, a Republican pollster with WPA Intelligence, said in an email. “Events like the Hong Kong protests, especially if they end in the seemingly inevitable crackdown by the Chinese, will only strengthen Americans’ distrust of China. So continuing to take a hard line and not agreeing to a deal just to make a deal is probably an electoral benefit for the president.”

Pence warned China that it would hurt trade talks if protests in Hong Kong weren’t resolved peacefully, adding another layer to the complexity of striking a deal.

“We don’t want China’s markets to suffer,"" Pence said in a speech Monday in Detroit. ""In fact, we want them to thrive. President Trump has a positive relationship with President Xi, and we have great respect for the Chinese people. We're in the midst of discussions with China, and they'll continue in the weeks ahead.”

“But for the United States to make a deal with China, Beijing needs to honor its commitments,” he added."

Anyone who says otherwise is lying. And even if there is a problem, it’s not President Donald Trump’s fault, it’s someone else’s.

It doesn’t bode well for a possible future where there is a recession under Trump: Who’s to say he’s not just going to lie about it?

Economists, forecasters, and other experts have been sounding the alarms regarding a potential impending recession in recent weeks. A confluence of factors, including the US-China trade war, slowdowns in the US manufacturing sector and some global economies, and a wonky concept called the inverted yield curve, have heightened anxieties a downturn might be on the horizon. That’s not to say you should panic: There are no guarantees an economic downturn is around the corner, and even if there were, most aren’t nearly as bad as the 2007-’09 Great Recession.

But if you listen to Trump, everything’s fine anyway.

It makes sense that a regular administration might want to downplay concerns about a recession, as panicking about a recession can sometimes be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

There are also political concerns at play: For any president staring down reelection in less than 15 months, the prospect would be unnerving. But for Trump, who has staked much of his presidential success on bragging about the strength of the economy and stock market, it’s likely especially concerning.

Which is why he seems set on saying there’s nothing wrong in the first place. It’s a signal of what may happen if and when the US economy is in real trouble: Trump will probably deny it or, at the very least, place the blame on someone else, such as his hand-picked Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, or the classic “fake news.”

Trump is already floating conspiracy theories on what’s up with the economy

Trump’s first course of action amid concerns the US economy could weaken is a familiar one for the president in the face of information he doesn’t like: deny, deny, deny.

Last week after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 800 points in one day because the bond market signaled a recession might be on the horizon, the president took to Twitter to shore up confidence that the economy is just fine.

“Unlike others, the economy is strong,” he tweeted on August 14, the day of the big stock market drop (from which it has since recovered).

The next day, Trump declared on Twitter that the US is “by far, the Biggest, Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World,” with consumers in the “best shape ever” and business optimism riding high. He blamed the media for any suggestion otherwise and insisted his trade war with China, which economists say is doing harm to the economy, is going just fine.

The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election. The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2019

Our economy is the best in the world, by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2019

“I don’t think we’re having a recession,” the president told reporters over the weekend. “We’re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut.”

Trump also held up Walmart’s latest strong quarterly earnings report as evidence that the economy is strong. It’s not the best piece of evidence: Walmart is the type of store that can do well during a recession — it did last time around — because people have to do more discount shopping.

Walmart, a great indicator as to how the U.S. is doing, just released outstanding numbers. Our Country, unlike others, is doing great! Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2019

Even if there is a problem, Trump insists, it’s only because of the Fed and Powell, who Trump appointed over former Fed Chair Janet Yellen in 2018. Trump, apparently incensed that Powell intends to act independently as head of the US central bank, has consistently complained about his pick and pressured him to keep interest rates low in hopes of bolstering the economy and stock market. The Fed cut interest rates in July for the first time in a decade, but that still hasn’t appeased the president. He wants it to do more and, in the meantime, plans to use it as a scapegoat.

.....The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2019

.....We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate, and we should be lower than them. Yesterday, “highest Dollar in U.S.History.” No inflation. Wake up Federal Reserve. Such growth potential, almost like never before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019

Maggie Haberman at the New York Times reported that Trump’s conspiracies and blame game tactics are going on behind closed doors as well:

Mr. Trump has repeated the claims in private discussions with aides and allies, insisting that his critics are trying to take away what he sees as his calling card for re-election. Mr. Trump has been agitated in discussions of the economy, and by the news media’s reporting of warnings of a possible recession. He has said forces that do not want him to win have been overstating the damage his trade war has caused, according to people who have spoken with him.

It’s not just Trump; his aides are saying there’s nothing to worry about as well. Over the weekend, both Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, and Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, took to the Sunday shows to downplay any concerns about a possible recession.

“We’re doing pretty darn well in my judgment — let’s not be afraid of optimism,” Kudlow told Meet the Press’s Chuck Todd.

“What I can tell you with certainty is that we’re going to have a strong economy through 2020 and beyond with a bull market,” Navarro told Martha Raddatz on This Week.

If the economy does falter, it’s not great to have a president who’s going to lie about it

There’s no surefire way to know that the economy is or isn’t headed for a recession. Economists are more concerned a downturn might be on the horizon now than they have been previously, but if economic downturns and stock market busts were easy to predict, well, we’d have a much better track record of guessing. The US in the midst of its longest expansion ever right now, and eventually, something’s got to give. But we aren’t going to be able to pinpoint when it will happen, or even how bad it will be.

But if and when a recession does come, it would be nice to have a president who would be honest about it and better able to use all available tools to combat it. Say the US-China trade war contributes to a downturn: To many administrations, it would be worth weighing the costs and benefits of a trade dispute, even if they did ultimately stay the course. Trump, however, appears inclined to just say that’s not the problem.

If the US does slip into a downturn and companies start laying off employees and closing factories, consumers stop spending, and investors pull their money out of the market, that’s a moment for the US government to take earnest steps to try to remedy the situation and figure out what’s next. A Trump tweet complaining that CNN is out to get him isn’t going to help you keep your factory job. (See: GM in Ohio.)

That’s not to say Trump won’t do anything. While speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Trump confirmed reporting from the Washington Post the day prior that the White House was considering a payroll tax cut to try to keep the economy from slowing down. He said the White House had been thinking about it for “a long time,” even though the White House told the Post the day before that it wasn’t under consideration. It’s worth noting that, presumably, a payroll tax cut or any other tax law change would require buy-in from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, given that Democrats control the House.

He also continued to pressure the Fed on interest rates while speaking with reporters in the White House and said a payroll tax cut might be needed not because of a potential recession, but instead because of the Fed. “If the Fed would do its job, we’d have a tremendous spurt of growth,” he said.

Of course, Trump and Republicans already passed a massive tax cut in late 2017 that cut taxes for most Americans, though it largely benefited corporations and the wealthy. The law was supposed to spur economic growth to at least 3 percent annually. But that didn’t happen: US economic growth has not hit that mark.

Trump has pulled a tax cut out of thin air in the past when convenient, only for it to go away. Remember the fake pre-midterms middle-class tax cuts that died soon after voters went to the polls last year?

There are already enough nerves around the economy right now. The president isn’t exactly helping: on Wednesday morning, he lashed out again on Twitter and said the “Fake News LameStream Media” is trying to create a recession."

The Commerce Department on Wednesday said the U.S. economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized pace from July through September, far short of the 3 percent sustained clip that the White House promised would result from the 2017 tax cut law.

Several hours after the Commerce announcement, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point to just under 1.75 percent in a bid to spur more growth. But the central bank also hinted that there might not be any more interest rate cuts on the horizon, as officials plan to monitor developments going forward, despite constant pressure from President Trump to do more.

“Weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and impose ongoing risks,” Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters after the decision. But he added that the Fed’s current stance is “likely to remain appropriate.”

The Fed’s new wait-and-see approach is one of many Washington decisions that is now up in the air, clouding the outlook going forward.

Congress and the White House still have not passed legislation to fund most of the government after November 21, and an impasse could lead to another shutdown. President Trump has tried to secure a partial trade agreement with China for next month, but planning was in disarray Wednesday when the Chilean summit where he hoped to finalize the agreement was cancelled. And the outcome of the 2020 election could lead to a markedly different change in trade, tax and regulatory policy, a prospect that can lead businesses to move more cautiously when it comes to spending and hiring.

A number of factors are weighing on the economy, but Powell pointed to the trade concerns and slowing global growth as worries at the top of the list. He also said, however, that there were signs that the trade skirmish with China could ease if Trump can broker a partial deal with Beijing next month, and Powell expressed confidence that consumer spending could remain strong. Helping matters, the unemployment rate remains at a half-century low, the stock market is at very high levels, and the housing market has recently shown signs of rebounding.

The Commerce Department data show that consumer spending continues to power the economy, but business investment has now contracted for six straight months, falling 3 percent in the third quarter, the biggest drop since the end of 2015. In recent announcements, a number of companies have said they are pulling back or pausing investment because of economic uncertainty, particularly related to Trump’s trade war with China.

“We’re still in the middle of really trying to understand where the trade talks are going to land and how that’s going to impact the overall economy,” GM chief executive Mary Barra said on an earnings call this week.

Spending on both structures and equipment was deeply negative from July through September, Commerce reported, and manufacturing is currently in a technical recession.

“In general, uncertainty still seems to kind of reign,” Robert Biesterfeld, chief executive of logistics company C.H. Robinson, said in an earnings call Wednesday.

The U.S. economy amounts to more than $21 trillion in goods and services each year. It is driven largely by consumer, business, and government spending, but its health can changed based on external shocks, trade decisions, and public policy, such as changes in the tax code.

Trump has made economic growth a defining issue of his presidency, but growth is now weakening. It grew 2.9 percent in 2018 but in the past six months it has appeared to have returned to the slower pace it notched during the final year of the Obama administration. Powell stressed, however, that he expects the economy to continue growing and the Fed is not forecasting a recession is near. Low unemployment, rising wages, and high stock prices have helped fuel consumer spending. Higher federal government spending also provided some lift to growth, helping offset the business investment decline.

“The consumer is still the main engine of economic growth, plus federal government spending. The nation just capped off a year of nearly a trillion-dollar deficit. Not surprisingly, all this federal spending is showing up in the GDP numbers,"" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic adviser at PNC Financial Services Group.

Trump has sought to highlight elements that he perceives as strengths in the economy, and top White House officials believe this should be a main plank of his reelection bid. Shortly before the new economic data was released, Trump wrote on Twitter that this was “The Greatest Economy in American History!”

Asked about Trump’s comment on Wednesday, Powell declined to comment.

Some White House officials have privately expressed concerns that the economy is entering a slowdown. After a weak second quarter, White House officials were hopeful that there would be a big rebound, in part because they wanted to resolve trade issues with China and complete a revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Complicating matters in the third quarter, which is reflected in the new Commerce data, the White House veered multiple times in its approach to the economy. Within a matter of days, Trump announced that he was interested in a new tax cut package, then cancelled the plans, then said he wanted U.S. companies to prepare to withdraw from China.

The wild moves left many companies – and investors – spooked about the White House’s approach, and that was reflected in the Commerce data about new business spending.

“The capital spending numbers were awful, and a bit worse than we expected, with structures investment -- oil rigs, offices, factories, commercial premises -- plunging 15.3 percent,” said Ian Shepherdson chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

Trump’s economic agenda has resulted in tax cuts, deregulation, trade fights, and spending increases. He and top aides have said this approach would lead to a major acceleration in economic growth, which had slowed markedly during President Obama’s last year in office. The unemployment rate has fallen since Trump’s election from 4.7 percent to 3.5 percent, consumer confidence and spending are strong, and the stock market reached a new all-time high this week.

Economists would typically expect that after businesses cut back on spending, they would start laying off workers to save costs, which would lead to decreased consumer spending. But as of yet consumers continue to prop up the expansion. Almost half of the third quarter’s growth could be attributed to residential construction and spending on recreational goods such as computers, bicycles and books, as well as at grocery and liquor stores.

Trump has continued to celebrate any good economic news, including the stock market record this week, and blame any weak numbers on Democrats and the Federal Reserve, the institution he says choked growth by keeping the cost of borrowing too high.

Though he has in the past responded quickly to any announcement by the Fed, he was silent after they made their announcement Wednesday.

The U.S. economy is in the midst of its 11th straight year of growth, making this the longest expansion in the nation’s history.

During Trump’s term in office, the economy has grown at an annual pace of about 2.35 percent, after accounting for the effects of inflation and other factors. If that pace were to continue, it would edge past George W. Bush’s first term and Obama’s second to become the fastest term of growth since Bill Clinton’s presidency.

But economic growth has fallen short of the performance recorded under other presidents. In the recent past, Clinton and Ronald Reagan each oversaw two terms of growth above 3 percent a year. Growth of at least 2 percent has been the norm for decades -- the U.S. typically hits that mark in two out of every three quarters."

According to trade experts, the move indicates that the trade war is inflicting increasing harm to American industries and consumers — and that the White House is trying to mitigate that damage and lower tensions as negotiators from the two countries try to work out a deal.

President Donald Trump acknowledged Friday that he and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, were having ""a little spat,"" but noted that a deal was not necessary before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

“The timing of this is important because there seems to be at least a little movement in the direction of ramping down tensions,” said Michael O. Moore, a professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University. “If you’re trying to make a deal, this makes perfect sense.”

The exemptions were on goods in three separate tranches of tariffs the U.S. imposed between July 6 and Sept. 24, 2018 that total $250 billion worth of imports. All three are temporary, with the exemptions on the $200 billion portion expiring Aug. 7, 2020, with the other two sets of exemptions expiring one year from now. U.S. business interests had requested tariff exclusions for these items on the primary grounds that they either could not get that particular item from a U.S. producer or a third country, or that it would be prohibitively expensive to do so.

Moore said the variety of items on the list reflected the global nature of today’s supply chains, and the wide breadth of the U.S.-China trade relationship. “The two economies are intertwined after 30 years of intense commercial buildup,” he said.

Altogether, the 437 types of goods receiving exemptions comprise a diverse list of consumer goods as well as parts, raw materials, components and production equipment for industries ranging from construction to healthcare to mining. The eclectic nature of the list reflects, in part, which industries were most successful at lobbying the USTR to issue exemptions on goods important to their businesses.

There were a number of consumer products among the listed items: dog harnesses, retractable leashes, GPS collars and pet drinking fountains. Also exempted were several items related to outdoor leisure and hobbies: Off-road ATVs, single-speed bikes and electric skateboards, along with pool vacuum parts and thermometers, coolers, portable ice-cube makers, steel wire barbecue grill tops, patio torches, and some metal pergolas and gazebos.

Since most of the initial tranches of tariffs sought to avoid consumer goods in favor of industrial components or inputs, the bulk of the list reflects that, including a large number of car and airplane parts, airport conveyor belts, circuit boards, several types of plastic film, sheeting and coated textiles.

Although the restaurant and hotel industry has been shying away from single-use plastics, standard-sized plastic drinking straws were exempted from the tariffs, along with the plastic cups used to make single-serve coffee pods. Hospitality businesses that are trying greener alternatives also get some relief, though; machines for manufacturing paper straws were on the list as well.

Some of the items reflect the extent of the tariffs’ impact on the construction and homebuilding industries. Exemptions were granted on certain kinds of wood-laminate flooring, equipment used to produce engineered quartz countertops, bulldozers, forklifts, portable concrete mixers, chain-link fencing, woodworking tools and equipment.

The much-beleaguered agricultural sector got some relief due to exemptions on feeding troughs, machines and enclosures for livestock. “The pressure on U.S. farmers is intense because of the Chinese retaliatory tariffs,” Moore said. “I think the administration’s trying desperately to reduce the pressure.”

The list also illustrated the degree to which the healthcare industry is dependent on Chinese imports. It included parts for MRI and X-ray machines, surgical implements like cauterization tools, masks, electrodes, scopes and respiration meters.

“Medical products generally have very strict procedures on what is allowed to be used and imported into the United States. That means it’s difficult to move production to another country,” Moore said, adding that driving up Americans’ already-high healthcare costs would be detrimental all around. “That could have very bad outcomes.”

Moore said the medical category is a good example of what this list illustrates in a broader sense: That President Donald Trump’s goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. is unlikely to succeed. “It’s clearly a recognition that the tariffs aren’t helping U.S. firms,” he said. “Production would move to other countries other than the United States.”

In today’s global economy, Moore said, “A firm’s choices are not just the United States or China.”"

In two tweets Monday, Trump kept up his pressure on the Fed and its chairman Jerome Powell, saying the U.S. economy was strong “despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed.”

Powell is Trump’s hand-picked choice for the top Fed job.

He said Democrats were trying to “will” the economy to deteriorate ahead of the 2020 election.

Trump administration officials in recent days have sought to calm worries about a potential U.S. recession that were heightened by last week’s steep stock-market decline.

The Fed on July 31 cut its key policy rate for the first time in more than a decade, reducing it by a quarter-point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. It cited a number of “uncertainties” that were threatening the country’s decade-long expansion, from Trump’s trade battles to slowing global growth.

Economists and investors will be closely watching a speech Powell will give Friday at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for signals of whether the central bank is prepared to embark on a series of rate cuts to energize the U.S. economy.

Over the past year, Trump has kept up a steady drumbeat of attacks on Powell.

In addition to calling for the Fed to cut rates by a full percentage point, Trump also said the central bank should consider supplying “quantitative easing” as well, the term economists use to describe the Fed’s efforts to restart economic growth over the 2007-2009 recession by buying bonds to lower long-term interest rates.

The Fed did announce in July that it would halt its program to shrink its bond holdings this month, two months earlier than planned. But officials have given no indication that they are considering another round of bond purchases to increase the size of their balance sheet."

Supporters of the Trump administration’s tariff tactics continue to assure us that China will ultimately change its bad behaviors, and at little cost to the U.S. Now, however, weaker economic data is coming not just from China but from the U.S. as well.

Two separate surveys of the U.S. Purchasing Manager Index, an indicator for manufacturing employment and output, are now seeing a contraction, or close to it, for the first time in more than three years.

Businesses cite slowing global demand, a shift in supply chains, and increasing uncertainty in U.S.-China economic relations, as reasons why the U.S. might continue to see slower economic growth in the second half of 2019.

Researchers from the Federal Reserve Board estimate that trade uncertainty has already cost the U.S. as much as 0.8 percent of GDP. That’s because tariffs are taxes, and American businesses and consumers are paying higher taxes every day.

The latest increase of tariffs came on Sept. 1. Two more increases are scheduled for later this year, on Oct. 15 and Dec. 15.

The passionate supporters of tariffs argue that the aim should be not just to change China, but to encourage Americans to stop doing business in China altogether. They suggest that American businesses can simply find alternative suppliers in countries like Vietnam or Mexico.

However, the reality isn’t as simple as moving pieces on a chessboard. The numbers reflect what businesses already know: that you can’t just pack up and move production on command.

Since the Trump administration began placing tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods coming from China, it has also granted hundreds of exemptions from these tariffs for Americans who can’t find alternative suppliers outside of China.

The White House claims the tariffs have been an immense cost to the Chinese economy and are being paid for by China, but roughly $20 billion worth of products are exempt from these taxes because they would be too costly for American businesses to go without.

Just a few months ago, the Trump administration announced tariffs for a separate $300 billion worth of goods coming from China. But shortly after, the tax on half this amount was delayed out of fear of cutting into Christmas shopping.

Specific products like pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals inputs, select medical goods, rare earth materials and critical minerals were exempt from tariffs altogether.

Of course, there are those that aren’t exempt from the tariffs. And because they aren’t able to find alternative suppliers outside of China either, they’re stuck paying the price – more than $20 billion in additional taxes over the last year.

Overall, trade between the two nations has declined but not enough to displace China as one of the U.S.’s top trading partners. U.S. goods imports from China are down 12 percent from last year, and exports are down 18 percent. But the U.S. and China are looking to do $570 billion worth of trade in 2019, compared to the $660 billion worth of trade in 2018.

If there’s a silver lining to all of this U.S.-China trade turbulence it’s that it’s unlikely to cause a U.S. or Chinese recession. That’s because total trade with China makes up only 3.6 percent of U.S. GDP; trade with the U.S. makes up only 5.4 percent of China’s GDP.

It bears noting, however, that business with China isn’t just about trade, it also includes investment.

Recent reports suggest U.S. business investment in China isn’t slowing, despite the tariffs. In fact, investment in China is growing. U.S. businesses have already invested $6.8 billion in China this year, up 1.5 percent from a year ago.

More than 80 percent of the American businesses that actually operate in China say they have no plans to move out of China. They also have no plans to reduce their investments in China.

Historically, the U.S. is the second-largest investor in China, with direct investment totaling $117 billion.

As much as some would like to see the U.S. “win” a trade war, or Americans and Chinese stop doing business with each other, the numbers suggest that’s not happening.

Until President Trump gets what he wants, nothing is certain but more trade uncertainty."

The Trump administration could soon start to publicize that calculation, along with the cost and benefits of categorizing an animal that way, under new rules it finalized earlier this month.

Trump officials said they will not use the new rule to determine whether a species is listed — federal law requires that decision to be based solely on scientific data. Instead, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which implement the Endangered Species Act, said the information would be used to better inform the public. Economic analyses are already included when specific plans are made to protect a species.

Habitat loss is widely considered the number one threat to endangered species, so saving a species usually requires the protection of large swaths of land.

That land often includes natural resources, such as trees that can be logged or water used for agriculture, that are considered natural capital. When those resources are used unsustainably, they often generate more money in the short term (more trees are being logged and sold, for example), but less money in the long term (when there are no more trees to be logged).

Environmentalists caution that calculating costs and making them public could influence, even subconsciously, whether government officials list a species, saying the Trump administration already has a track record of siding with businesses and rolling back environmental protections.

The new rule has, in a sense, already had an effect, by raising debate over how Americans should determine the value of a species and whether it is possible to accurately weigh the costs and benefits of keeping plants and animals from going extinct.

How much would you pay to save a species?

For decades, environmental economists have asked Americans how much they, personally, would pay to preserve a species.

Some Americans are willing to pay up to $167 per household per year to preserve salmon, for example, $54 for the bald eagle and $14 for the Florida manatee, according to various studies.

But those values are largely arbitrary and say more about public perception that a species true value. Responses tend to depend on whether a person lives close to the plant or animal’s habitat, whether an animal is popular and whether the species is known to have financial benefits, such as fish that are caught and sold as food.

Analyzing data that is more concrete than, say, your feelings about the manatee can be complicated.

“The important thing is measuring not just the costs, which are obvious and easy to measure, but also the benefits, which are harder to conceptualize and measure,” said Christian Andres Langpap, a professor of applied economics at Oregon State University.

If a company is required to stop or scale back a project in order to preserve a habitat, for example, analysts can count up the number of jobs lost and additional money spent. But calculating how much money is saved decades down the road if a species’ habitat is left in tact is more difficult.

Here’s what we do know.

Federal and state agencies spent $1.5 billion on endangered and threatened species in fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent data available. The total price tag is likely substantially larger because that number does not include the cost other agencies incur to comply with the Endangered Species Act or the lost value to landowners and businesses who could make more money off their land if not for related restrictions.

Industries often produce their own estimated costs for species protection. In a debate over protecting the spotted owl in the Northwest, one logging industry estimate found protection would cost Washington state $94.6 million in wages annually.

But some of those claims do not hold up to scrutiny, and environmental groups say those estimates should be weighed against another kind of cost: the loss of our natural capital.

“Everytime we drain a wetland or cut down a forest, there are a lot of consequences that follow,” said Steve Polasky, an environmental economics professor at the University of Minnesota.

The decline in bees, butterflies and other pollinators, for example, could cost farmers between $235 billion and $577 billion in crop loss each year, according to a report that Polasky co-authored and that was produced by the international Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which is made up of more than 100 governments supporting biodiversity.

The extinction of plant species that could have been used for medicinal purposes would mean companies lose out on billions of dollars in potential profits, not to mention the loss of human lives. Bats, which count among them many endangered species, provide $1 billion worth of pest control for crops globally.

Calculating the indirect benefits of saving a species is more difficult because “we often are not really taking into account how interconnected species are,” said Lynn Scarlett, vice president of policy at The Nature Conservancy.

A small fish might not have many direct benefits for humans, but it is part of an enormous food chain. The extinction of the smaller fish could affect our seafood supply or be devastating to larger animals, such as dolphins, that people generally value more highly.

How economics could save both money and species

When deciding how to protect a species, Scarlett said wildlife officials should ask a series of questions that take costs into consideration. During the George W. Bush administration, she served as the chief operating officer and then acting secretary of the Department of Interior, which oversees the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Scarlett said it’s “just good government” to weigh whether some actions might be more effective and cost-effective than others.

But she cautions that there is a difference in determining what plans are most cost-effective and deciding whether a species is worth saving, which she fears the new Trump rules could encourage.

Others disagree that the Trump rules will damage species.

If businesses and private citizens know the economic impacts of listing a species as threatened or endangered they might “take voluntary conservation actions before a species is listed that could avoid the need to list altogether,” said Tyson Kade, a lawyer who counsels companies on Endangered Species Act compliance issues with the Washington, D.C.-based firm Van Ness Feldman.

More companies have been building environmental costs into their business models, as evidenced by the increased hiring of “sustainability officers.”

But environmental groups are skeptical that businesses, which often oppose environmental regulations, would be proactive about preserving ecosystems, no matter the long-term costs."

But the damage has not been insignificant to California’s economy.

The old joke about the California lieutenant governor’s office has been that its occupant’s main duty is to wake up in the morning, see whether the governor is still alive and, if so, go back to bed.

But that was before Gov. Gavin Newsom made Eleni Kounalakis his point woman on President Donald Trump’s trade wars.

Now, California’s lieutenant governor is among the busier officeholders in Sacramento—hustling to meet with members of Congress, federal agencies and trade organizations and deploying whatever influence she can to protect California’s place in the world market.

She has her work cut out for her. It has been a year since Trump sent a collective shudder through California’s economy, imposing taxes on imported steel and aluminum that in turn prompted China to impose new tariffs on agricultural products.

India and other countries soon followed suit, setting tariffs as high as 100% on some of California’s high-value crops. Since then, the Trump administration has engaged in trade brinkmanship on many fronts—including on-again, off-again threats to close the Mexican border. Meanwhile, a bevy of signature California products—almonds, pistachios, walnuts, wine grapes, oranges, dairy—have teetered on the verge of becoming collateral damage.

So far, the worst-case scenario has not come to pass, and some products, such as pistachios, have survived relatively unscathed, at least for now. But the damage has not been insignificant, either.

In a report last August, Daniel A. Sumner, an economist with UC Davis’ Agricultural Issues Center and Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, projected that higher tariffs could cost major U.S. fruit and nut industries $2.64 billion per year in exports to countries imposing the higher levies; the economic blow could rise to as much as $3.34 billion because of lower prices in alternative markets.

And some fears have been entirely realized. Sales of California oranges to China are off by more than half, broader problems in the state dairy industry have been exacerbated by trade tussles, and the almond and wine industries have struggled to cope with price pressures and punishing tariffs.

“Whenever you have an atmosphere of uncertainty, it creates a chilling effect,” Kounalakis said in an interview. “Customers in Asia will look for alternatives elsewhere.”

And, she added, if customers find suppliers in other countries—say, Turkey for pistachios or New Zealand for wine—it could be hard for California to win them back.

‘America First’

As he had vowed on the campaign trail, Trump since taking office has hewed to an “America first” protectionist stance, pushing back against Republicans’ traditional embrace of open markets. He pulled out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership and pushed for a reboot of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The resulting United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)—what some describe as NAFTA 2.0—faces an uphill battle for ratification in the now Democratic-controlled House.

In January 2018, Trump—saying he wanted to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair trade practices and to reduce the $375-billion trade deficit with China—slapped steep tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar energy cells and panels from nations including China and South Korea. He warned of and subsequently delivered on tariffs on steel, aluminum and other products from China.

China ratcheted things up by imposing bruising tariffs on agricultural products, including commodities such as soybeans and corn (which come primarily from the Midwest) and products for which California is revered.

To ease the burden on hard-hit farmers throughout the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has paid out billions of dollars in aid, mostly to producers of soybean, corn and other commodities. Most California growers did not qualify for direct payments, but some sold products to the federal food-purchase program, which feeds needy U.S. residents; some grower groups received funds to help market their products overseas.

When it comes to trade with China, a huge and growing market, billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs are at stake in California. According to the UC Davis Agricultural Issues Center, the state’s top five agricultural exports in 2017 just to China and Hong Kong amounted to more than $1.6 billion.

Overall, almonds are California’s leading agricultural export, with a value of nearly $4.5 billion in foreign sales in 2017; 70% of the almond crop grown in the state is exported. Almond exports now face a 50% tariff in China.

California has 6,800 almond growers, most of them small to medium-size, family-run enterprises. A study by the Almond Board of California found that the crop generated more than 100,000 jobs, mostly in the Central Valley. The industry contributes about $11 billion annually to the state’s economy.

Because China is the state’s third-largest export destination, the industry is seeing ill effects, said Julie Adams, vice president of global technical and regulatory affairs for the Almond Board of California.

“A 10 percent tariff went to 50 percent,” she said. “The uncertainty and concern about how long these retaliatory tariffs would be in place caused the industry to be more cautious in commitments and purchasing.”

Lost hours, lucky breaks

Monte Vista Farming Co. in the Central Valley town of Denair, Calif., is a vertically integrated company that grows, hulls, processes and markets almonds and almond products.

“What China has been for our industry for a long time was a sponge to absorb additional supply,” Monte Vista Chief Executive Jonathan Hoff said in an interview. “We can typically rely on them to take large amounts of volume in a short time when we have excess volume to ship. So not knowing whether or not we’ll be able to rely on that market … really influences our forecast for net earnings on the farm.”

Moreover, he said, because China did not take large amounts of volume during the September-to-December selling window, Hoff’s company has been forced to rent warehouses and buy additional storage bins to hold unsold crop. The company has also reduced employees’ hours at hulling facilities. The circumstances have put pressure on pricing, and Hoff expects the average return per acre to decline significantly.

California pistachio growers, who produce 99% of the nation’s crop, bemoan the ongoing uncertainty, but they got a couple of lucky breaks. China for years had imposed a 5% tariff on the state’s pistachios. In retaliation, it raised the level to 15% and then 45%.

For unknown reasons, China left the tariff on roasted pistachios at 15%. Meanwhile, Iran, another source, lost much of its crop to a freeze. Although Chinese buyers typically prefer to buy raw pistachios and do the roasting themselves, they switched their allegiance. Shipments to China from California were up 9.5% for the start of the new fiscal year, said Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers, a trade group in Fresno.

Orange growers weren’t so fortunate. China started with a 15%tariff that hit apple, cherry and grape “guys right between the eyes,” said Joel Nelsen, strategic advisor and past president of California Citrus Mutual, an advocacy group in Exeter for the state’s 2,500 family citrus growers. Then the Chinese added hefty tariffs to oranges and other commodities. Prices headed out of sight, with the result that business is off by more than half.

For wine grape growers, tariffs have been a double whammy. U.S.-imposed levies have raised significantly the cost of steel products—wire, stakes, metal posts—needed to establish vineyards.

Under the Trump administration, “things have gotten a lot more bumpy,” said John Aguirre, president of the California Assn. of Winegrape Growers in Sacramento. “We see a much softer market for wine grapes.”

The industry is concerned about continued access to China, which had been a growing market. Last September, China added a 10% tariff on U.S. wine imports, atop a previous 15% tariff increase implemented in April 2018.

Then there’s the uncertainty surrounding the renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, given that Canada is the industry’s largest export market. “Our thoughts have been: Do no harm,” Aguirre said.

A state trade policy?

Since trade policy is mostly determined at the federal level, California officials such as Kounalakis have only a limited ability to make a difference. Still, the lieutenant governor—a former ambassador to Hungary during the Obama administration—notes that the state’s size and stake in the market make it critical that California strive to be heard.

Officially, Kounalakis will head a new interagency committee on state development on trade and work with Newsom’s economic advisor, Lenny Mendonca, “to strengthen our foreign relations and advance our interests abroad,” as Newsom put it in announcing her post.

Practically, what that means is that she has been meeting with the California congressional delegation and officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other relevant agencies to educate them about the importance of the state’s agriculture and to lobby for free-flowing markets.

Among her priorities will be improving coordination among state agencies that deal with trade and reopening a trade office in Mexico to expand California’s presence.

And, she notes, she has a vote of confidence that Newsom didn’t get when, during California’s 2011 climb out of the recession, he put forward his own statewide economic plan as Gov. Jerry Brown’s lieutenant governor. (Brown, consumed with a statewide budget deficit, took issue and appointed a statewide jobs czar, pre-empting Newsom’s plans.)

But the economic landscape under Trump is a far cry from the one California faced in 2011, with even more uncertainty in the near future. Will the president continue to waffle on his threat to close the southern border with Mexico, a move that observers say could wreak havoc with daily economic back-and-forth? Will Congress, with its new Democratic House majority, approve the USMCA? Will Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping come to terms?

“We don’t know what the long-term strategy is,” said Sara Neagu-Reed, associate director of the California Farm Bureau Federation’s federal policy division. “There is some sense of hope with future trade negotiations. … The more markets we can open up, the better. … With that said, [we must] continue to present the administration with the impacts our growers are seeing in China, Canada and the European Union.”

That, says the Almond Board’s Adams, is why California needs all the help it can get—even from historically underutilized statewide offices—and why “the fact that the governor is making trade a focus of the lieutenant governor is important.”

Kounalakis agrees.

“For anyone who thinks that this international portfolio is, you know, having tea and going on trips,” Kounalakis recently joked during a panel discussion in Sacramento, “that’s not what this is about.”"

Economics and public policy professor at University of Michigan Justin Wolfers says he’s optimistic about the U.S. economy because “recessions don’t die of old age, they’re murdered.” However, he is worried “that a small adverse shock could turn into something more calamitous with policy mistakes coming out of the White House.”"

In the letter, Trump — who earlier seemed to give Erdogan a green light to invade the Kurdish-held parts of Syria — threatens him with reprisals. He says “[y]ou don’t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people” and “I don’t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy.”

It is hard to describe how unusual this letter is. Teddy Roosevelt famously described how he liked to “speak softly and carry a big stick.” Trump’s preference instead appears to be to make loud threats that he may not be able to deliver on.

Trump is getting very excited about sanctions

The background to this threat is that Trump seems to have recently discovered America’s sanction power. In his impromptu news briefing with Italy’s president Wednesday, he had a lot to say about the “newfound economic power of the United States.” In Trump’s description: “The United States has tremendous economic power. Far more power than playing around with having a few soldiers shooting each other at the border. … The power we have with sanctions and tariffs is far greater than what we are talking about.” Trump’s belief that he can destroy Turkey’s economy seems to be based on a newfound faith in sanctions and tariffs as an instrument of economic coercion.

Of course, Trump has liked tariffs for a long time, but he has usually seen them as a way to make purely economic threats, to get the United States a better deal on trade. His threat of sanctions may not be very plausible: His comments at the news briefing suggest he isn’t particularly worried about what Turkey does to the Kurds. However, his discovery of sanctions as a new toy to play with may have long-term repercussions.

Trump’s understanding of sanctions has some gaps

As we describe in our recent article on how the United States has “weaponized interdependence,” U.S. sanctions can indeed do a lot of damage to other countries’ economies. The United States has unparalleled influence in the global economic system, because international banks rely on the U.S. dollar. This allows the United States to issue sweeping sanctions against institutions, individuals and even entire countries, and to threaten that any banks that fail to apply these sanctions will have access to the dollar “clearing system” cut off. This — together with U.S. influence over the SWIFT financial messaging service — is what allowed the United States to effectively isolate Iran from the global financial system.

However, there are limits to U.S. power. As we noted in an article for the National Interest, former policymakers like Jack Lew, who used to be treasury secretary, fear the more the United States uses this kind of power, the more it gives states and other actors incentives to undermine America’s central role in the global financial system. In Lew’s description: “the plumbing is being built and tested to work around the United States. Over time as those tools are perfected, if the United States stays on a path where it is seen as going it alone … there will increasingly be alternatives that will chip away at the centrality of the United States.” Trump appears to have fixated on the power of sanctions to hurt economies, and to not have a strong grasp of how overuse could damage U.S. financial power in the long run.

Turkey is an important test case

It is an open question as to whether the United States could indeed destroy the Turkish economy. Certainly, the United States could damage Turkey’s financial system, and Tuesday’s decision by U.S. prosecutors to indict a major Turkish bank for sanctions evasion has sent ripples of fear through Turkey’s financial sector. However, Turkey’s economy is bigger than Iran’s and far better integrated into the global financial and trade system. It also borders Europe. If the United States sought to impose sweeping sanctions on Turkey, it is highly doubtful that America’s European allies would comply. They are too exposed to possible Turkish retaliation.

Moreover, Turkey has already been thinking hard about how to insulate itself from U.S. pressure. In August, documents were discovered that suggested Turkey wanted to join with Russia in creating financial arrangements that would allow its banks to avoid the dollar clearing system, and the power of the United States. On Oct. 8, Russia and Turkey signed an agreement that they would gradually move toward using Russian rubles and Turkish liras to clear financial transactions between the two countries. Turkey furthermore suggested it would connect its banks to Russia’s alternative to the SWIFT financial messaging service, and adopt Russia’s “Mir” network, which is an alternative to credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard that are subject to U.S. law. It is not clear how far Turkey will go — but it is at the very least implicitly sending signals to the United States that it has alternatives if wide-scale sanctions are imposed.

Empty threats may damage U.S. credibility

It is extremely unlikely that the United States will deliver on Trump’s threat of destroying Turkey’s economy. The risks would be high, and the benefits uncertain. It is, however, entirely possible that Trump’s loud rhetoric and lack of delivery will lead Congress to impose sanctions independently that do damage to Turkey’s economy without destroying it.

The long-term question is whether Trump’s letter will lead to the further undermining of U.S. power. On the one hand, other leaders may decide not to take his rhetoric seriously: He has a track record of making sweeping threats and changing his mind within hours or days. On the other, the lack of consistency may itself do damage to U.S. financial power. The U.S. Treasury and Justice departments have worked hard to build up a reputation for being willing to take action against states or businesses that step over their red lines. The willingness of Trump to erase red lines, reinscribe them with threatening rhetoric reminiscent of a Mafia boss and then erase them again may damage that reputation."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images

The U.S. economy is chugging along. Employers added 201,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate held steady at a low 3.9 percent. Average wages in August were nearly 3 percent higher than they were a year ago.

Who should get the credit for that strong performance?

At a campaign rally in North Dakota last week, President Trump boasted that he's responsible for the economy taking off like a ""rocket ship.""

But Trump's predecessor wants to remind everyone that the countdown began on his watch.

""When you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started,"" former President Barack Obama told supporters Friday at the University of Illinois.

This is not just a question of bragging rights. With midterm elections less than two months away, voters' impressions of who deserves credit for the boom could influence which political party they support in November.

Let's stipulate that presidents of both parties often get more credit and blame for economic conditions than they deserve, given that much of what happens is outside their control. But setting that aside, is Trump simply coasting on the momentum of an already strong Obama economy? Or have things turned around on his watch?

White House economist Kevin Hassett insists that Trump deserves the credit.

""I can promise you that economic historians will 100 percent accept the fact that there was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump and a whole bunch of data items started heading north,"" said Hassett, who chairs the council of economic advisers.

""Inflection"" is just a fancy word for turning point. So Hassett is arguing that conditions since Trump was elected are significantly different than conditions were before.

It's hard to see such a turning point in major economic yardsticks such as jobs, unemployment, or wages.

(If you're not seeing the charts, click here for interactives on total U.S. payrolls, the jobless rate and average hourly earnings over time.)

Job growth has been remarkably consistent since the end of the recession in 2010. The 3.6 million jobs added in the 19 months since Trump took office are roughly comparable to the 3.9 million added in the previous 19 months under Obama. Likewise, unemployment has steadily declined. And wages have inched up at a slow but steady pace.

On a graph of any of these metrics, the period before Trump took office is virtually indistinguishable from the period since.

""At best, you would say it's been a continuation of a steady trend,"" economist Austan Goolsbee told MSNBC.

Goolsbee, who had Hassett's job early in the Obama administration, challenged the idea that things suddenly improved following Trump's election.

""I don't see how you come into the game with 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter, your team is already ahead, and you're like, 'I won this game.' ""

But Hassett presented his own charts to back up the idea of a Trump turning point.

Enlarge this image toggle caption White House Council of Economic Advisers White House Council of Economic Advisers

One area he focused on is the growth in what the Labor Department calls ""goods-producing"" jobs such as manufacturing, construction and oil drilling. (Hassett called these ""blue collar jobs,"" although the term ""blue collar"" can also refer to some service-sector jobs such as custodial or warehouse work.)

Goods-producing employment has accelerated since Trump took office, even as job gains in the much larger service sector have slowed. As Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton of the Brookings Institution have noted, that could be helpful to Republicans in November, since goods-producing jobs tend to be concentrated in redder, more rural parts of the country.

""As the elections approach, smaller, redder places are doing relatively better than they were in 2016,"" Muro and Whiton wrote.

It's important to remember, though, that goods-producing jobs make up a relatively small slice of the overall U.S. economy, accounting for less than 14 percent of the total workforce. By focusing on those jobs, the Trump administration is discounting the industries that employ 86 percent of American workers.

Hassett also highlighted a surge in business investment in property, plants and equipment beginning around the time that Trump was elected.

""What's happened is that the capital spending boom that we promised would happen if we passed the tax cuts is underway,"" Hassett said.

In theory, that additional investment should make workers more productive, boosting both output and wages in the future. But not everyone is convinced that the boom is widespread or that Trump and the tax cuts are responsible.

The president of the federal reserve bank of Atlanta says much of the increased investment is in the energy sector, driven by higher oil prices.

""Excluding energy and oil investment, investment growth is still below 5 percent on a year-over-year basis — a bit lower than the typical expansion average,"" Raphael Bostic told the Savannah, Ga, Rotary Club in June.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Whit House Council of Economic Advisers Whit House Council of Economic Advisers

One area where there is a clear, election-related turning point is small-business sentiment. Members of the NFIB, a Republican-leaning small-business group, were significantly more optimistic after Trump's upset victory in 2016, perhaps anticipating his policies of tax cuts and reduced regulation.

""People started to ratchet up their expectations for what would happen to the economy,"" Hassett said. ""Everybody, except for Mrs. Clinton's supporters, was starting to do that right after the election.""

Significantly, Hassett did not highlight GDP growth, perhaps because the measure has bounced up and down and would not show a clear difference between Trump and Obama. Although Trump often boasts about the strong GDP showing between April and June — when growth topped 4 percent — there were quarters during Obama's tenure when growth was even stronger. Forecasters disagree about whether Trump can deliver sustained, multiyear growth in the 3 percent range, as promised.

So while the White House can certainly point to some yardsticks that indicate a meaningful turnaround on Trump's watch — including small business sentiment, business investment and goods-producing job growth — broader measures of the overall job market and wages show the economy continues to follow the steady, upward glide path that began under Obama."

“We have the best economy the country's ever had and it's getting better.”

— Trump, in an interview with the Daily Caller, Sept. 3

It started, as so many things do, with a tweet.

Now, in 40 different venues over three months, according to our database of false and misleading claims, President Trump has declared that the economy is the greatest, the best or the strongest in U.S. history. That’s a rate of every two days. In some cases, such as the rally in West Virginia — a rally, that like all of his campaign rallies was aired without interruption on Fox News — he repeated the statement as many as four times.

This type of presidential braggadocio leaves us with a conundrum. One could dismiss it a merely overheated rhetoric, as one historian suggested to The Fact Checker. (Another joked, “you should put these questions to a rabbi, not an economic historian.”) But is there a point at which the statement becomes its own form of truth through consistent repetition? The president has said it so often that by the end of the three-month period, he even quoted himself: ""It's said now that our economy is the strongest it's ever been in the history of our country.”

So it appears we must delve into this issue.

The Facts

The president is an avid watcher of Fox News, and good economic news is regularly touted on programs hosted by some of his favorites, such as Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs.

“The Trump economy remains red-hot, stocks hitting new highs today. Consumer confidence soaring to levels not seen in nearly two decades,” Dobbs announced Aug. 28. A day earlier, Dobbs echoed another favorite talking point of the president. “He campaigned, remember, for minority votes, asking what have you got to lose? Everyone now is winning with this president. ... He's done more for the minorities in this country than any president in frankly decades.”

Interestingly, though, a review of transcripts over the past three months finds that neither Hannity nor Dobbs would go so far as to echo the president’s line about this being the greatest economy in U.S. history. On July 31, Hannity came the closest, but with an important caveat: “This is the single greatest economy that we have had in 10 years.”

There's little argument about that. Ten years ago, the United States was in the midst of the Great Recession, which ended in June 2009.

The economy certainly is pretty strong right now, with the unemployment rate low and stock market indices at record highs. We will lay aside the issue of whether Trump can claim credit for the state of the economy because of his tax bill and deregulatory efforts, or whether he merely inherited a winning hand from President Barack Obama. We will keep our focus on whether it is indeed the strongest in U.S. history.

There are several metrics one could look at — and which the president has mentioned at times — but the current economy falls short, according to experts.

Unemployment rate. The unemployment rate in August was 3.9 percent, and it dipped as low as 3.8 percent in May. But the unemployment rate was as low as 2.5 percent in 1953. In fact, it was below 3.9 percent for much of 1951, 1952 and 1953. The unemployment rate was as low as 3.4 percent in 1968 and 1969 and was 3.8 percent in 2000.

Still, jobless claims, a more volatile figure, fell at the end of August to the lowest level since 1969.

When Trump campaigned for president, he used to twist the labor force participation rate in a misleading example of a flagging economy. But the labor force participation rate has not greatly improved under Trump. The retirement of the baby-boom generation is a major factor. Moreover, the labor force participation rate for men of prime working age (25 to 54) has remained stuck at about 88.9 percent, compared with 97 percent in the 1950s and 1960s.

Gross Domestic Product. This is another statistic Trump often cites. The GDP is the broadest measure of the economy. and during the campaign he promised to achieve an annual growth rate of 4 percent. In the second quarter, the rate was 4.2 percent, but that’s still below the 5.1 percent and 4.9 percent achieved in two quarters in 2014, or the 4.7 percent increase in a quarter in 2011.

It may be a stretch to achieve an annual growth rate of 3 percent for all of 2018; in 2017, growth was 2.3 percent. In 1997, 1998 and 1999, the GDP grew 4.5 percent, 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. But even that period paled against the 1950s and 1960s. Growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4.4 percent to 6.6 percent. In 1950 and 1951, it was 8.7 and 8 percent, respectively, and then was 4.1 and 4.7 percent in 1952 and 1953.

Economic historians pointed to these data points to say the president’s claim is off base.

“He is completely wrong. Growth was much higher in the early 1960s at close to 5 percent per year and unemployment was below 3 percent,” said Michael D. Bordo, director of the Center for Monetary and Financial History at Rutgers University, adding that the tech boom in the 1990s was also a period of rapid growth. He said even higher economic growth was probably achieved in the 1870s, when Ulysses S. Grant was president.

“Real GDP growth was faster in the ’50s and ’60s,"" said Robert J Gordon of Northwestern University. “Most important, real income growth was equally rapid across the bottom and top of the income distribution between 1947 and 1980, while from 1980 to 2017 it has been heavily concentrated at the top. “ He added that “wages are still stagnating, average hourly earnings [growth] of 2.8 over last year is about the same as the consumer price index, so real wages haven’t grown at all. That’s very different than the period before 2007 and particularly the years before 1973.”

Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College professor who wrote a history of trade policy, said that although the economy is not growing as fast as in some previous periods, “the economy is doing pretty darn good by historical standards.” He noted that real per capita income is at an all-time high. While the trend line in the United States has generally been up, except in recessions, he said that is a “remarkable feature"" of the U.S. economy that few other countries have matched.

Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and author of “The Past and Future of America’s Economy: Long Waves of Innovation That Power Cycles of Growth,” said the GDP is not a valid measure of “the strongest economy” in the first place.

“It’s a bit like looking at the best-selling movie’s box office receipts,” he said. “It’s easiest to be the top-grossing movie today because there are more people in the U.S. than ever before and ticket prices are highest, because of inflation.”

Atkinson said a better measure is growth in productivity — the output per hour of work. “By this measure, the economy under President Trump is actually performing very poorly, compared to postwar figures,” he said. “In the six quarters since the president was elected, business labor productivity grew 1.4 percent per year, compared to periods in the 1960s and the period between 1996 and 2004 where it grew approximately two to 2.5 times faster.”

The Pinocchio Test

The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton — and Ulysses S. Grant.

The odd thing is that Trump does not need to claim that the economy is the greatest ever. He just needs to say it’s doing great. He should take a cue from his fans at Fox News and not push the envelope so much. Who knows? He may someday have bragging rights. In the meantime, he earns Three Pinocchios.

President Donald Trump thinks he’s overdue some credit for steering the strongest economy on the planet – and he’s probably right.

“These numbers are very, very sustainable – this isn’t a one-time shot,” Trump said on Friday, speaking from the South Lawn of the White House after news that the US economy grew at a 4.1% annual rate in the second quarter of the year.

Fresh from a trip to the Midwestern heartlands, the President is making the very best possible case for his administration as the pace heats up ahead of the midterm elections. He’s belting out a strong economic message with a fervor that Democrats have yet to match this election cycle.

Presidents usually get too much blame when the economy is doing badly, since downturns are often caused by outside shocks or cyclical factors, but that also gives them a chance to crow when things are going full steam ahead.

Trump is not the kind of person to pass that up.

Often, the President’s hyperbolic assessment of his own performance is at odds with the facts. But Friday’s announcement that the economy grew at a 4.1% pace in the second quarter, the best showing since 2014, is genuine cause for celebration.

It may also be his best chance to argue that a huge and controversial tax cut, the only really significant legislation he has managed to pass, is – as he said it would – unleashing prosperity.

“We’ve never seen anything like (what) is going on right now,” Trump told a hugely supportive crowd of steelworkers in Illinois on Thursday.

“GDP numbers will be announced tomorrow sometime. I don’t know what they are, but I think they’re going to be terrific,” he added. “You know, when we took over it was really low, and it was heading lower, a lot lower. And it was going to be there fast. And great things have happened. So, whatever those numbers are, watch for them. Somebody actually predicted today, 5.3 (%). I don’t think that’s going to happen.”

Looking for a boost

The strong growth number gives the White House a significant boost after days of grim headlines, and its failure to move on from the President’s humiliating summit performance with Russian President Vladimir Putin nearly two weeks ago.

It also offers some personal respite for Trump, given that he must feel that legal walls are closing around him, following news that one of his most important confidants, Allen Weisselberg, has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors investigating his former lawyer Michael Cohen.

The New York Times reported on Thursday that special counsel Robert Mueller is examining Trump’s tweets, potentially to see whether they can help him build a case that the President acted with malicious intent when he sacked former FBI Director James Comey.

Trump is forever trying to change the subject. With the current state of the economy, he may have some ammunition.

Unemployment is lower than it has been for decades, corporate earnings are strong and it seems unlikely that a sudden crisis is looming that could derail things before Americans head to the polls in midterm elections that will have a huge bearing on Trump’s presidency.

Recent polls show that the economy is one of the few issues where Trump is approaching the kind of numbers that presidents conventionally need to win re-election.

A Quinnipiac University poll conducted from July 18-23 showed that majorities of voters thought Trump had weakened the US abroad, was too close to Putin and lied about important issues. But a near majority – 49% – backed his handling of the economy.

Republican hopes of staving off a Democratic blue wave and boosting Trump’s re-election prospects in 2020 may hinge on more voters deciding that for all the uproar and dislocation and falsehoods of the Trump presidency, he has made them more economically secure and given them a pay raise for which they have waited years.

GOP’s best bet

It’s no exaggeration to say that the economy represents Trump’s best argument heading into the fall. And Trump appears to be getting increasingly frustrated that the story is not being told.

Pointing at the press cameras during his trip to Illinois he complained: “They’re dying to see us make a little bit of a mistake.”

“Even though we’ve been here for a little more than a year and a half … we really hit it big over the last six months,” he said.

Trump can make a fair argument that he is not getting the credit he deserves on the economy, but he often has only himself to blame for it getting overlooked, given the daily political turmoil he creates.

And his White House displayed deepening concern in recent days about Trump country districts that sent him to the White House.

While the President claimed Thursday that his steel and aluminum subsidies on China and a clutch of US allies had revived the industry, his trade war threats appear to be having an alarming impact elsewhere.

The administration just unveiled a $12 billion aid program for farmers slammed by Chinese reprisals targeting Trump voters that are already having a painful impact on US soybean and pork exports.

The President also appeared to step back from the brink of a trade war with the European Union on Wednesday, basically agreeing to a deal to just start talking about tariff cuts.

“We just opened up Europe,” Trump said in Dubuque, Iowa, earlier Thursday, misleadingly overstating the significance of his deal with Europe .

Key House and gubernatorial races in states that Trump won and will need again in 2020 are beginning to increasingly get bogged down in debate over the direction of Trump’s trade policies. A set of NBC/Marist polls this week showed his approval rating down below 40% in Michigan and Wisconsin, which paved his way to the presidency.

There’s also plenty of scope to quibble with the substance of Trump’s economic claims. While growth may be roaring, critics say the tax cuts may not filter down significantly to blue-collar Americans and are certain to widen economic inequality.

The GOP, which once prided itself – at least in opposition – on fiscal responsibility, has exploded the deficit. Wage growth, long the downside of the recovery since the Great Recession, is still fairly flat, meaning that to some voters, Trump’s end zone dance might come across as a little premature."

""When you hear how great the economy's doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started,” Obama said on Friday in a speech that marked his first foray into the upcoming elections. ""I mean, I'm glad it's continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that's been going on, when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers, suddenly Republicans are saying it's a miracle. I have to kind of remind them, actually, those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.""

Trump disparaged the speech, at one point saying he fell asleep during it.

“If the Democrats got in with their agenda in November of almost two years ago, instead of having 4.2 up, I believe honestly you'd have 4.2 down,” Trump said Friday night, speaking of GDP growth. “It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country since, I guess, to be totally specific, because I'm not sure they've gone any further, since the Great Depression.”

“The Economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our country’s history,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday.

Earlier this summer, he stood on the South Lawn of the White House and boasted about achieving a ""turnaround of historic proportions"" — an ""economic miracle.""

The Economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our country’s history (remember, it’s the economy stupid!), that the Democrats are flailing & lying like CRAZY! Phony books, articles and T.V. “hits” like no other pol has had to endure-and they are losing big. Very dishonest people! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2018

The economy's success or failure depends on much more than who sits in the Oval Office, but let's take a look at the facts here.

Was the economy struggling when Trump took office?

Absolutely not. Trump inherited a booming economy with low unemployment and steady job growth — an easy win on day one — and he quickly claimed credit. Early in his presidency, Trump boasted about job gains starting from his election onward, crediting Obama's final months as his own.

It is extremely unlikely that the GDP could ever have been negative 4.2 percent no matter who was elected in 2016. At the height of the 2009 recession, GDP was at -2.5 percent. It has not been at or above -4.2 percent in 86 years.

The economy was, however, struggling when Obama took office in 2009. He inherited a dismal economy in the middle of a recession that lasted 18 months, facing what many feared would be a depression, and was able to turn it around in the first years of his presidency. The U.S. is now its 10th year of economic growth, and in its longest period of growth with 95 straight months of job creation. The bulk of that decade of growth was under Obama’s presidency, and can fairly be credited to him.

Still, as Trump accurately points out, the recovery under Obama was marked by a slower rate of growth than what followed previous recessions, such as the recovery under President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and 1984.

But, what about the Trump effect?

Trump's supporters say he's supercharged the economy. Now in the second year of his presidency, he has passed a major tax bill and rolled back a significant number of regulations, giving the economy another injection of capital — though economists disagree on the how much the tax cuts will really benefit the larger economy and whether it will have lasting effects to the economy.

Trump has surely seen some impressive data points in his first term: GDP growth has reached 4.2 percent, unemployment has reached its lowest point in half a century, and the stock market has reached new heights.

The president and his administration have been eager to tout the numbers. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, kicked off the White House press briefing on Monday with a slew of charts. He said the growth is not an extension of a trend, but rather a ""clear upward trajectory, way above the trend.""

Economists aren't buying it: While the tax cuts probably helped inject some cash into the economy — particularly the stock market — the country has largely maintained the growth it saw under Obama.

The numbers Hassett touted, economists said, were cherrypicked to show a trend that economists say they're just not seeing.

""The entire story of claiming some major change in economic activity doesn’t ring true,"" said Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman. ""I think there’s really very little to point to, and you’d have tell some story based on stock market. Any time the story hinges on the stock market, that means an economist is going to be very much on weak ground.""

Hassett did correct Trump, who tweeted Monday morning that ""the GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!""

Multiple news organizations had fact checked the president's statement earlier in the day, and found ""100 years"" to be false. This type of relationship between the GDP and the unemployment rate had not happened in 10 years, Hassett confirmed in response to a question from a reporter.

""You'd have to talk to the president about where the number came from, but the correct number is 10 years,"" Hassett said. Trump has yet to correct his tweet.

Still, it's impossible to tease out Trump's economy from Obama's this early in the former's presidency. GDP last reached 4.2 percent during Obama's second term. And where workers are concerned, Trump's gains do not yet match his predecessor's. Since Trump took office, the country has added 3.58 million jobs, short of the 3.96 million jobs that were added in the final 19 months of Obama's presidency.

Economies do not grow overnight, or turn on a hair with a new presidency. While Obama can look back on his eight years and see his leadership play out, Trump's effect is still not yet known.

""In my view, the [Trump] effects are going to be much longer term — we shouldn't be looking at these indicators right now, which is just kind of a continuation,"" Harvard economist Marc Melitz said, citing tariffs and renegotiated trade deals as a top concern down the line. ""It’s going to generate a lot of instability. Already you can see some of it in terms of higher prices for a lot of materials in the U.S.""

Trump has previously said that the U.S. is enjoying the best economy in America’s history — a claim other fact checkers have ruled to be false.

But it certainly is one of the best, as Trump tweeted today — thanks in large part to Obama."

The statements capped a week of mystifying assertion in which Trump also invented history by saying he won the women’s vote in the 2016 election, saw progress with North Korea that isn’t evident to his top diplomat and boasted of “success” and “record business” in U.S. health care programs that have yet to start.

A look at the claims:

2016 ELECTION

TRUMP: “I did win that women’s vote, didn’t I? Remember, they said, ‘Why would women vote for Trump?’ Well, I don’t know, but I got more than she did. That’s pretty good.” — remarks Thursday in Granite City, Ill.

THE FACTS: No, he didn’t. About 54 percent of women nationally voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to exit polls, compared with Trump’s 41 percent.

HEALTH CARE

TRUMP, on a health insurance option for small businesses and self-employed people: “I hear it’s like record business that they’re doing. We just opened about two months ago, and I’m hearing that the numbers are incredible. Numbers of people that are getting really, really good health care instead of Obamacare, which is a disaster.” — remarks Thursday in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: The Trump administration’s new health insurance option isn’t producing “record business,” because a roll-out of the plans doesn’t begin until September.

Even after the plans take effect, their impact is expected to be somewhat limited.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates a modest impact of 4 million people who will be covered by the association plans within five years. That’s compared with nearly 160 million who are covered by job-based insurance, the 12 million eligible for expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare,” and the 10 million in the ACA’s private insurance markets.

WATCH: Funding cuts, premium increases and the future of Obamacare

TRUMP: “We’re greatly expanding telehealth and walk-in clinics so our veterans can get anywhere, at any time, they can get what they need, they can learn about the problem and they don’t necessarily have to drive long distances and wait. It’s been a very big success.” — remarks Tuesday to Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Kansas City, Missouri.

The Trump administration’s new health insurance option isn’t producing “record business,” because a roll-out of the plans doesn’t begin until September.

THE FACTS: A new benefit that would give the nation’s veterans access to commercially run walk-in clinics is not a success at all, because it hasn’t started.

It won’t begin for another year and the care won’t always be freely provided “anywhere, at any time.” Only veterans who have used VA health care services in the previous two years would be able to get care at the private walk-in clinics. After two visits, veterans could be subject to higher co-payments charged by the VA.

TRUMP: “We passed Veterans Choice, the biggest thing ever. … It has got to be the biggest improvement you can have. So now if you can’t get the treatment you need in a timely manner, people used to wait two weeks, three weeks, eight weeks, they couldn’t get to a doctor. You will have the right to see a private doctor immediately, and we will pay for it.” — remarks Tuesday.

THE FACTS: The care provided under the Choice program is not as immediate as Trump suggests, nor is it likely to be the “biggest thing” ever. Currently only veterans who endure waits of at least 30 days for an appointment at a VA facility are eligible to receive care immediately from private doctors at government expense, a standard that the VA is frequently unable to meet.

Under a newly expanded Choice program that will take at least a year to implement, veterans will still have to meet certain criteria before they can see a private physician.

A recent report by the Government Accountability Office found that despite the Choice program’s guarantee of providing an appointment within 30 days, veterans waited an average of 51 to 64 days.

ECONOMY AND TRADE

TRUMP: “We’ve accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.” — remarks Friday on a new economic report.

THE FACTS: That doesn’t square with the record. Trump didn’t inherit a fixer-upper economy.

The U.S. economy just entered its 10th year of growth, a recovery that began under President Barack Obama, who inherited the Great Recession. The data show that the falling unemployment rate and gains in home values reflect the duration of the recovery, rather than any major changes made since 2017 by the Trump administration.

While Trump praised the 4.1 percent annual growth rate in the second quarter, it exceeded that level four times during the Obama presidency. But quarterly figures are volatile and strength in one quarter can be reversed in the next. While Obama never achieved the 3 percent annual growth that Trump hopes to see, he came close. The economy grew 2.9 percent in 2015.

The economy faces two significant structural drags that could keep growth closer to 2 percent than 3 percent: an aging population and weak productivity growth

The economy faces two significant structural drags that could keep growth closer to 2 percent than 3 percent: an aging population, which means fewer people are working and more are retired, and weak productivity growth, which means that those who are working aren’t increasing their output as quickly as in the past.

Both of those factors are largely beyond Trump’s control.

TRUMP: “One of the biggest wins in the report, and it is, indeed a big one, is that the trade deficit — very dear to my heart because we’ve been ripped off by the world — has dropped.” — remarks Friday.

THE FACTS: Trump is correct that a lower trade deficit helped growth in the April-June quarter, but it’s not necessarily for a positive reason.

The president has floated plans to impose import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign goods, which has led to the risk of retaliatory tariffs by foreign companies on U.S. goods.

This threat of an escalating trade war has led many companies to increase their levels of trade before any tariffs hit, causing the temporary boost in exports being celebrated by Trump.

Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial, said the result is that the gains from trade in the second quarter will not be repeated.

WATCH: What the strong economic growth means for average Americans

TRUMP: “We’re having the best economy we’ve ever had in the history of our country.” — remarks Thursday in Granite City, Illinois.

THE FACTS: This is not the best the U.S. economy has ever been.

The unemployment rate is near a 40-year low and growth is solid, but by many measures the current economy trails other periods in U.S. history. Average hourly pay, before adjusting for inflation, is rising at about a 2.5 percent annual rate, below the 4 percent level reached in the late 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as it is now.

Pay was growing even faster in the late 1960s, when the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for nearly four years. And economic growth topped 4 percent for three full years from 1998 through 2000, an annual rate it hasn’t touched since.

TRUMP: “The Canadians, you have a totally closed market … they have a 375 percent tax on dairy products, other than that it’s wonderful to deal. And we have a very big deficit with Canada, a trade deficit.” — remarks Thursday in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: No, it’s not closed. Because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada’s market is almost totally open to the United States. Each country has a few products that are still largely protected, such as dairy in Canada and sugar in the United States.

Trump also repeated his claim that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, but that is true only in goods. When services are included, such as insurance, tourism, and engineering, the U.S. had a $2.8 billion surplus with Canada last year.

TRUMP: “Veterans’ unemployment has fallen to the lowest level in almost 18 years. … And I’ll guarantee, within a month or two months, that 18 will be even a much higher number.” — remarks Tuesday at VFW convention.

THE FACTS: This boast is based on outdated numbers.

The veterans’ unemployment rate was 3.3 percent in June, a low rate historically, but that is still above the 2.7 percent rate in October, which was the lowest in nearly 17 years.

Veterans’ unemployment has fallen mostly for the same reasons that joblessness has fallen for everyone else: strong hiring and steady economic growth for the past eight years.

The vets’ unemployment rate peaked at 9.9 percent in January 2011, then fell by more than half to 4.5 percent by the time Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. Since then, it has fallen an additional 1.2 percentage points.

Trump won’t be able to get to a higher number than 18 years, as he promises to do, because the data only go back to 2000.

NORTH KOREA

TRUMP: “We’re also pursuing the denuclearization of North Korea and a new future of prosperity, security, and peace on the Korean Peninsula and all of Asia. New images, just today, show that North Korea has begun the process of dismantling a key missile site. And we appreciate that. We had a fantastic meeting with Chairman Kim, and it seems to be going very well.” — remarks Tuesday.

THE FACTS: Trump’s assessment that his administration’s plan to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons is “going very well” is not fully shared by his own secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. In fact, Pompeo acknowledged this past week that the North is still producing fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Trump made his remarks after the North Korea-focused 38 North website released recent satellite imagery that seems to show dismantlement underway at Sohae.

But Pompeo sounded a note of caution. He said that while such a step would be in line with the pledges that Kim made to Trump at the June 12 summit in Singapore, it would have to be confirmed by international inspectors.

Analysts say dismantling a few facilities at the site alone won’t realistically reduce North Korea’s military capability or represent a material step toward denuclearization.

Indeed, at a Senate hearing Wednesday, Pompeo acknowledged that North Korea continues to produce fuel for nuclear weapons despite Kim’s pledge to denuclearize. Pompeo said there was “an awful long way to go” before North Korea could no longer be viewed as a nuclear threat.

AMAZON AND MANUFACTURING

TRUMP: “The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their ‘delivery boy’ for a BIG percentage of their packages…” — tweet July 23.

THE FACTS: He’s wrong to suggest that the U.S. Postal Service delivers packages for Amazon below cost. Federal regulators in fact have reviewed the Amazon contract with the Postal Service each year and determined it to be profitable.

READ MORE: Trump says he’s taking ‘a pretty serious look’ at Amazon

Trump is upset with Amazon because its founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, which Trump has labeled “fake news” after the newspaper reported unfavorable developments during his campaign and presidency.

While the Postal Service has lost money for 11 years, package delivery, a bright spot, is not the reason.

Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn’t been enough to offset pension and health care costs as well as declines in first-class letters and marketing mail. Together, letters and marketing mail make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.

Amazon sends packages via the post office, FedEx, UPS and other services, and has taken steps toward becoming more self-reliant in shipping.

TRUMP: “On the South Lawn, you have the space capsule. And every part is made right here, in America.” — remarks July 23 at Made in America event.

THE FACTS: Trump neglects to mention a key detail: NASA’s Orion crew capsule, one of the star products at the White House event celebrating U.S. manufacturing, will ride through space thanks to Europe.

With its four solar-array wings, the European Service Module supplies propulsion, power and the essentials of life for the capsule’s space travels and marks a departure for NASA.

“For the first time,” the agency says, “NASA will use a European-built system as a critical element to power an American spacecraft.” Airbus, Boeing’s prime competitor in commercial air travel, leads an array of European companies that made the service module.

President Donald Trump is more than 19 months into an administration engulfed in so much controversy that it may overshadow a tremendous achievement, namely an economic boom uniquely his. During his time in office, the economy has achieved feats most experts thought impossible. GDP is growing at a 3 percent-plus rate. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Meanwhile, the stock market has jumped 27 percent amid a surge in corporate profits. Friday brought another round of good news: Nonfarm payrolls rose by a better-than-expected 201,000 and wages, the last missing piece of the economic recovery, increased by 2.9 percent year over year to the highest level since April 2009. That made it the best gain since the recession ended in June 2009. His critics, a group that includes a legion of Wall Street economists, most Democrats and even some in his own Republican Party, don't believe it will last. They figure the current boom will begin petering out as soon as mid-2019 and possibly end in recession in 2020. But even they acknowledge that the current numbers are a uniquely Trumpian achievement and not owed to policies already set in motion when he took office. ""I still believe the big story this year is an economic boom that most folks thought impossible,"" Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council and a chief advisor to Trump, said in a recent interview with CNBC.com. ""I understand that he's been in for a year and a half, but when you look at those numbers, this is not going away."" Indeed, the economy does seem to be on fire, and it's fairly easy to draw a straight line from Trump's policies to the current trends.

Trump's economic achievements

Business confidence is soaring, in part thanks to a softer regulatory environment. Consumer sentiment by one measure is at its highest level in 18 years. Corporate profits, owed in good part to last year's tax cuts, are coming close to setting records. Each of those accomplishments can be tied either directly to new policies or at least indirectly through a brimming sense of hope from businesses that the White House is back on their side. ""When you look at those confidence indexes, they're telling you something,"" Kudlow said. ""His attitude is, we're not punishing business, we're not punishing success, we want to make things easier to do business and to hire, and I think it's had a very positive effect and a very palpable effect."" GDP most recently gained 4.2 percent in the second quarter, the best performance in nearly four years.

At the same time, the unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, just one-tenth of a percentage point above the lowest level since 1969. But there are some more telling figures about just how much progress has been made under Trump. At a time when most economists had been using the term ""full employment"" to describe the economy, 3.9 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the working during the Trump term. During the same period under former President Barack Obama, employment had fallen by 2.6 million. The economy in total, while still not in breakout mode, has grown by $1.4 trillion through the second quarter under Trump; the same time period for Obama saw a gain of just $481 billion, or a third of Trump's total. Businesses are investing, consumers are spending and innovation is on the rise as well.

Trump pledged that he would pare down regulations that were choking business activity. While the actual moves toward deregulation haven't been quite as ambitious as planned, the approach has won him converts in the business community. The most recent reading from the National Federation of Independent Business was the second highest in history dating back 45 years. Small business owners reported aggressive hiring plans, the only obstacle to which has been a dearth of labor supply. The end of June saw 6.7 million job openings and just 6.6 million Americans classified as unemployed, an unprecedented imbalance. ""Expansion continues to be a priority for small businesses who show no signs of slowing as they anticipate more sales and better business conditions."" NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan said in a statement.

How he did it

Trump's economic program was very simple: an attack on taxes and regulations with an extra dose of spending on infrastructure and the military that would create a supply shock to a moribund economy. On the tax side, the White House pushed through a massive $1.5 trillion reform plan that sliced the highest-in-the-world corporate tax from 35 percent to 21 percent and lowered rates for millions of taxpayers, though the cuts for individuals will expire in 2025. On deregulation, Trump ordered that rules be pared back or eliminated across the board. During his time in office, Congress has cut back on the Dodd-Frank banking reforms, particularly in areas affecting regional and community institutions, rolled back a multitude of environmental protections that he said were killing jobs and took a hatchet to dozens of other rules. (The left-leaning Brookings Institution think tank has a rolling deregulation tracker that can be viewed here.) During the first year of his administration, ""significant regulatory activity"" had declined 74 percent from where it was in the same period of the Obama administration, according to data collected by Bridget Dooling, research professor at GW's Regulatory Studies Center. The Dodd-Frank rollbacks have been particularly helpful to community banks, whose share prices collectively are up more than 25 percent over the past year. Small-cap stocks in general have strongly outperformed the broader market, gaining 23 percent over the past 12 months at a time when the S&P 500 is up 17 percent. The Federal Register, where business rules are stored and thus serves as a proxy for regulatory activity, was 19.2 percent smaller from Inauguration Day until Aug. 16 under Trump than during the same period for Obama. ""You can think of that as turning off the spigot of new regulations,"" Dooling said in an interview. She said more aggressive movement appears to be on the way. Dooling said recent regulatory changes from the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Education and Labor will advance deregulation in an even ""more meaningful way."" In addition to expected deregulation benefits, there's also anticipation that the true benefits of tax cuts have yet to kick in. that he attributes the bulk of new economic growth to deregulation rather than the tax cuts, whose benefits he expects to come later. ""It's still too early to tell. We haven't seen any of the multipliers yet from tax reform,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. ""We have enough in terms of ammunition to put in 3 percent growth for the rest of this year and even all of 2019, but we haven't seen sort of this spike in activity yet."" There's been another interesting trend that is peculiar to the Trump economy: a drifting of benefits from urban centers to nonmetropolitan areas, which are seeing their first collective population growth since 2010. Trump's tax cuts ""should deliver greater tax relief to rural areas where there is a higher rate of small business owners who will benefit from the favorable pass-through tax rates,"" Joseph Song, U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a recent note to clients.

Despite his free market ideology, President Reagan imposed quotas on auto imports from Japan to protect the U.S. industry in the 1980s. Japanese companies responded by jumping over the barrier and bringing best-practice manufacturing facilities to the U.S. market. The trade barrier did not stop American consumers from buying Japanese cars. Today, companies that want to avoid the new tariffs on washing machines or solar panels can expand operations here. Trump is not motivated by trade theory, of course, but by the political advantage that comes from blaming trade for the decline in blue collar jobs. Trump’s trade policies may damage our trading partners, like Mexico or Canada, and they have undermined the standing of the U.S. in the world, but they will have little impact on U.S. growth either way. That said, China has a lot of economic weapons, and entering a trade war with China would be very damaging, indeed. Fortunately, the president seems to have walked back from such a conflict.

Unlike the tax bill, the Trump Administration’s policies on trade and immigration are a break with Republican tradition. Traditionally, Democrats have been much more ambivalent about trade agreements than Republicans because of the opposition of labor leaders, although in the end Democratic presidents have supported them. Like most economists, I support freer trade because it allows the United States to specialize in the parts of the economy where it is most productive. Some workers and companies are hurt by trade, but overall free trade is good for U.S. growth.

More recently, the decline has been in high-tech and high-growth entrepreneurial companies and the reason for that decline remains a puzzle. 3 Since the Great Recession, a lack of financing may have contributed to the problem. Before the Great Recession, new companies could get started by using the equity in the homes of the founders. Home prices have recovered but there is still not the same ready supply of home equity and startups have to find other sources of cash. It was too easy to get a loan in the first years of this century, while today it may be too hard. Easing lending restrictions too much would increase the chances of another crisis, but that is unlikely to happen in the next few years. I would expect that general business optimism plus easier lending rules will help the small business community and add to economic growth, although not by a lot.

Small Business Lending. Small and medium sized businesses were hit hard during the recession and were slow to recover. As the economy has strengthened, this sector of the economy is doing better, but is still behind. The number of startup companies has been in decline for decades and the reasons are not fully understood. In earlier decades, the decline simply reflected changing technology. Many new businesses were in retail or restaurants and the expansion of large retailers and chain restaurants drove out the small startups.

This administration has opened up additional land for drilling and eliminated restrictions on the burning of coal. Are these changes going to solve a pressing problem in the economy? U.S. energy production has been soaring as a result of new technologies. Oil production is moving above 10 million barrels a day and natural gas is very cheap and abundant. Renewable energy sources have now become price competitive with fossil fuels. In the end, the deregulation of energy under this administration is symbolic and will have very little consequence for near term growth. Given this, it seems a mistake to abandon efforts to scale back harmful emissions.

The new administrator of the EPA is opposed to most regulations and argues that global warming may be a good thing. 2 The administration is moving to eliminate restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. EPA does not control state laws, but under the Trump regime it will be easier and cheaper for companies to resolve environmental concerns—at the price of more pollution.

Environmental and Energy Regulation. The regulatory environment in the U.S. has become very cumbersome. Multiple federal, state and local agencies may have to agree on permits and the legal system can drag out final approval for investments and expansions. The Obama Administration worked to streamline the approval process, but remained very supportive of cleaning up the environment.

In meetings with business groups attended in recent years, I found the hostility towards the Obama administration startling. While many in the business community recognize problems with Trump, they see him as a fellow businessperson who is on their side and believe he will be able to spur faster growth. That optimism may be enough to kick off stronger investment and business expansion.

Perhaps the impact of the Trump policies are being understated by these technical analyses. Trump has been able to transform the mood of American business. Corporate leaders said Obama did not understand how business operates, blamed them for the economy’s problems and did not appreciate that they need to do well if the economy is to do well.

Estimates of the impact of the tax act on long run growth vary a lot, but analyses that look at the overall impact of all provisions have results that center around growth rate increases of 0.06 to 0.09 percent a year over a decade. 1 The economic incentives built into the tax plan have a very small impact on growth, according to these estimates.

At the same time, the corporate income tax was full of distortions and had a marginal tax rate higher than most other advanced economies. There has been a case for corporate tax reform, which should mean eliminating deductions and tax breaks and using the revenue gained to lower the tax rate. That is hard to do politically because the companies that lose tax breaks fight to keep them. With some important exceptions, the administration’s tax bill took the easy way out, leaving most tax breaks unchanged and then cutting the statutory tax rate and reducing the taxation of foreign profits.

The centerpiece of the administration’s growth program is the tax cut bill that reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. On its face, a policy to reduce taxation of corporations is a solution in search of a problem. Corporate profits have been booming since the end of the recession and the share of profits in national income has risen. Not all companies and not all industries are doing well but, on average, U.S. corporations have lots of cash on-hand. If they want to expand and invest more, they have the resources to do it. Few companies paid the full amount of the statutory tax rate because of a variety of tax breaks put into the law over the years. The tax on corporate profits has been a smaller share of GDP in the U.S. than the average for OECD countries.

In 2017, the stock market was strong, employment gains were solid, and GDP growth was a bit faster than in the past few years at 2.5 percent. In 2018, so far, employment and GDP growth have continued to look solid, but the stock market has become very volatile, triggered by fears of inflation and higher interest rates. This is a good time to assess the Trump economic program and whether it will actually improve U.S. economic growth to the degree the president claims it will.

President Trump and his economic team have made big promises about boosting future economic growth. Though official budget estimates assume growth will rise to 3 percent a year, the president suggests growth could be much faster. What policies have been implemented to justify these claims? The Administration has acted quickly on regulation, scaling back environmental rules and allowing more drilling. With new financial regulators in place, there has been some easing of bank rules, although no big changes. And, of course, just before the end of 2017, a tax bill was passed that lowered corporate taxes substantially and lowered individual taxes for some.

Immigration restrictions may have large effects. Trump proposes cutting legal immigration and closing the border in an effort to eliminate illegal immigration. The Pew Research Center estimates that the working age population in the United States will actually start to decline in the absence of immigrants,4 so there could be a significant decline in labor force growth and hence in the overall economic growth rate if there are drastic cuts in the number of immigrants.

Immigrants have been important in startup companies, especially technology companies. Silicon Valley was in part a creation of immigrants. Hostility towards immigrants will discourage smart and talented people from coming to the U.S. and undermine growth over the long run. It is hard to put a number on the impact, but it could be considerable.

Infrastructure

Trump campaigned on a pledge to introduce a large program of infrastructure investment. Specifics are now emerging and the proposed federal funding contribution is $200 billion over ten years. There is no question that America needs to upgrade its infrastructure. Roads, bridges, ports, the electricity grid, the water supply and other areas are in need of help. In the administration’s plan, the $200 billion would be leveraged into $1.5 trillion through private, state and local funding. The federal funds would be divided into $20 billion for projects of “national significance,” $50 billion for rural block grants and the rest would go for loan support or other likely high-leverage. The administration also wants to shorten the time for permitting and approvals.

It would certainly be helpful to speed up the permitting process and shorten litigation delays, but that will be tough to do, in practice, because many of the regulations are state laws.

And while taking $200 billion and multiplying it up to $1.5 trillion will be a pretty neat trick, it’s worth noting that the $200 billion is not a net addition to federal support. Some of that money is simply moved around from existing funding. It’s a stretch to think that the administration’s infrastructure initiative will have a significant positive impact on U.S. growth.

Barriers to faster growth: demand and supply

It is unusual to enact a large deficit-financed fiscal expansion when the economy is already at full-employment, but full employment does not mean the economy will hit a wall when it is given a demand boost. The fiscal stimulus will almost certainly increase growth in 2018 and 2019. There are advantages to a high-pressure economy where employers are fighting for workers and are even willing to hire unskilled workers and train them. Workers did well in the high-pressure economy of the late 1960s and again in the late 1990s.

The snag, of course, is that a high pressure economy may turn into an inflationary economy and the Federal Reserve is charged with barring the door against that possibility. Following the tight economy of the 1960s there was an inflation problem that lasted for 15 years. Following the tight economy of the 1990s, though, there has been no inflation problem, in fact the Federal Reserve has had trouble getting inflation up to its target of 2 percent. Monetarist economists who predicted runaway inflation from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing policy have fallen on their faces as inflation has stayed low or even fallen. Believers in the Phillips curve tradeoff between inflation and unemployment have done better, but not much better.

At times recently it has seemed that the determinants of inflation are a mystery—but really they are not a complete mystery. The rise of China and the Asian supply chain held down prices of manufactured goods. The expansion of the supply of commodities has eased pressure on the prices of oil, metals and food. Prolonged recession in Europe and Japan and slowing growth in China eased demand globally. But these forces have run their course or are no longer powerful enough to offset a global economy that is now growing faster and a U.S. economy that may be busting through its full employment benchmark. The Federal Reserve is already moving expeditiously to raise rates, and if inflation picks up they will accelerate the pace. The current stock market volatility started because investors were suddenly spooked about inflation and the Federal Reserve’s response. Rising interest rates will likely put a brake on U.S. growth.

If there is a limit to how much more growth can be obtained with demand expansion, that leaves supply growth as the main possibility. Supply-side growth is deflationary. The Federal Reserve would be willing to accommodate faster growth if it came from either a more rapid increase in the labor force or faster productivity growth.

Getting much help from faster labor force growth is a non-starter. Labor force participation has been declining for years as a result of an aging population and the lack of good jobs. If the fiscal stimulus leads to a high-pressure economy and that opens up better jobs, there could be some improvement in labor supply. However, whatever is achieved in higher–than-expected labor supply among native-born women and men will be offset by the restrictions this administration is placing on immigrants. If there are sharp immigration cuts, we will not achieve the 0.5 percent a year growth in the workforce that is currently predicted by the Congressional Budget Office.

Productivity is much more of a wild card and very tough to predict. GDP per worker grew at around 2.3 percent a year from 1950 through the early 1970s. It grew at 1.3 percent until the mid-1990s, when it resumed rapid growth again, at 2.8 percent a year, until 2004. Then it slowed down to under 1.1 percent a year. Slow productivity growth is the biggest reason GDP has grown so slowly since 2004.5

Since productivity growth has had such an erratic pattern, it is hard to argue that it can’t or won’t speed up again. Suppose, by some miracle, GDP per worker growth were to return to the rate of 2.8 percent achieved from 1995 to 2004. Add in 0.5 percent a year growth in the workforce and GDP growth would then be 3.3 percent a year, achieving the administration’s estimates. On the other hand, suppose productivity growth does not increase, staying instead at the same pace it has had from 2004 through 2017. This would put long run GDP growth at 1.6 percent a year. If immigration restrictions drop the growth in the labor force down below 0.5 percent, then the lower bound for GDP growth is even lower, perhaps 1.3 percent. That is a big range of possible values and where the economy comes out will make a big difference to the growth of American living standards, and to the fortunes of this administration.

The trouble with predicting a return to much stronger growth is that none of the policy measures being introduced can be expected to yield the super rapid productivity growth achieved in the 1990s. There might be a lucky break and it would happen, but it is a very long shot. In making their forecasts, the Congressional Budget Office averages the period of rapid growth with the much slower growth since 2004 and estimates the long run sustainable growth rate of the economy is 1.9 percent per year. That number is actually fairly optimistic. It does not assume significant reductions in the number of immigrants and it does assume growth of GDP per worker that is 0.3 percent faster than the rate since 2004. One could score that figure as a success for Trump growth policies, except that his ambitions are so much greater.

The deficit

There are voices crying in the wilderness about the problem of the budget deficit and these voices have not got any traction. They are going to get louder. Annual federal deficits are expected to exceed a trillion dollars a year and the debt to GDP ratio is headed quickly for 100 percent. Will debt and deficits derail economic growth? The reason deficit warnings have not been heeded so far is that voters do not see adverse effects. Americans are able to make use of federal services, such as Social Security and Medicare, while taxpayers provide much less than the full cost of these programs. Those who worry about deficits argue, correctly, that our children and grandchildren will have to service the debt so we are passing our deficit spending on to them. However, as long as interest rates remained low that burden has not seemed too bad. Americans have financed budget deficits by borrowing from the rest of the world, but are borrowing at such low rates that it looks like a great deal.

Looking forward, the deficit problem may be catching up with us. As the debt to GDP ratio moves to 100 percent, that means each percentage point of interest on the debt has to be paid for by 1 percentage point of GDP in taxes or in additional borrowing. The Federal Reserve is already pushing up rates at the short end of the yield curve and with the projected level of Treasury borrowing, long rates are bound to rise too. If the holders of US Treasury securities, including a lot of foreigners and foreign governments, decide US debt is risky, they will start demanding a risk premium on Treasuries. As interest rates rise, that puts a damper on US investment. The cut in corporate taxes has given a boost to investment, but that could be reversed by rising interest rates.

Looking forward, the deficit problem may be catching up with us.

There is one part of the economy that is already feeling the effect of the budget deficits: the part exposed to foreign trade, particularly manufacturing. Borrowing from abroad constitutes an inflow of financial capital that pushes up the value of the dollar, making U.S. goods and services more expensive and imports cheaper. Large and persistent U.S. trade deficits started in the 1980s when big federal deficits first began. There is not a direct year-to-year connection between the budget deficit and the trade deficit because other factors can impact both of them. A recession increases the budget deficit and reduces the trade deficit, as happened in the Great Recession.

However, the connection between the budget deficit and the trade deficit does exist so that increases in the budget deficit will spill over into higher trade deficits in a full employment economy. That creates an irony for Trump’s policies. He has pledged to fight trade deficits by imposing trade restrictions, but these will be ineffective. Imposing trade barriers on Mexico, for example, will just shift U.S. imports to other products or other countries. In the meantime, the tax bill will push up the budget deficit and worsen the overall trade deficit.

Improving business sentiment versus unrealistic expectations

The most effective policy Trump has introduced to spur growth is to energize business leaders, making them more willing to invest and expand. The tax cut reinforces this by putting more money into the hands of companies and households and making the U.S. a more attractive place to invest.

But Trump has also introduced policies with a negative impact on growth, notably the restrictions on immigration and increases in the federal deficit. Trump seems incapable of any restraint in his claims of success and he talks about future growth rates that are very unlikely to occur. Over-promising and under-delivering is a dangerous game that can lead to disillusion and could undermine the optimism of business leaders. Perhaps the GDP statistics will soon be considered fake facts."

Weeks later, in his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump continued the theme, complaining that “we have the worst financial recovery in 65 years” while “our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.”

A year later, we can expect a very different message in Tuesday’s State of the Union speech. Trump has become a relentless cheerleader for the American economy, touting the low unemployment rate, steady job growth, and record stock market peaks that have occurred during his brief presidency.

Wonks will debate how much credit he really deserves, personally, for any of this. (Foreign markets have soared too, and several are also at all-time highs.) But the fact is that his words will resonate today just as his bleak view resonated in 2016, even with many people who ultimately didn’t vote for him. Gallup found in early January that Americans’ confidence in the economy soared 16 points during Trump’s first year in office, reaching positive territory for the first time since Gallup began tracking it in 2008.

But this transformation in perceptions is out of step with the underlying reality. The basic truth is that while the economy displayed steady growth over the past 12 months, the same was true of the 72 months or so that came before that. The big change hasn’t been in the economy but in people’s hearts — Republican Party loyalists, in particular, weren’t ready to admit the economy had recovered until they had a co-partisan in the White House.

The partially partisan economy

Two polls from Gallup tell the tale.

The first, comparing annual averages, shows that Democrats and Republicans have reacted very differently to Trump’s ascent, with Republicans becoming more positive about the economy and Democrats less so.

That perceptions of the economy would be mediated by partisanship is perhaps to be expected. But Trump’s key achievement here is that while both Democrats and Republicans have changed their minds about the economy, Republicans have responded more sharply. They’ve nearly uniformly developed positive views about the economy due to Trump, while many Democrats also hold positive views about the economy and likely simply give former President Barack Obama the credit for it.

Even more strikingly, Gallup’s weekly numbers show that the Republican turnaround in perceptions largely happened before Trump even took office.

It wasn’t, in other words, that something changed in the economy, Republicans gave Trump credit for it and then decided to start praising the economy. The mere fact that Trump had won the election made Democrats feel somewhat worse about economic conditions and Republicans feel a lot better.

Actual economic conditions, meanwhile, really have improved — but only at a modest pace that is entirely continuous with previous trends.

The economy just isn’t that different

The American economy as of last fall certainly had its share of problems — problems that Trump wasn’t shy about pointing out. The trouble is that, as Michael Grunwald wrote recently, none of the dark linings in the silver cloud of the Obama economy have changed under Trump:

In fact, by the standards Trump used to trash the Obama era in his speech to Congress, the Trump era has been another economic nightmare. “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force!” he complained last year. That was true at the time, if you included students, retirees and the disabled, but today, 95.5 million Americans are out of the labor force. “Over 43 million Americans are on food stamps,” Trump said last year. This year, it’s still over 42 million. “Our trade deficit in goods last year was nearly $800 billion!” Trump marveled. Under Trump, the trade deficit is increasing.

Trump has addressed this largely by changing the criteria by which he evaluates the economy. No longer does a healthy America require closing the trade deficit, drastically increasing the labor force participation rate despite an aging population, or making the labor market so robust nobody needs social assistance. Instead, Trump points to record-low black unemployment and a record-high stock market.

But the stock market first hit record high territories under Obama, and Trump-era market performance has actually lagged its Obama-era average. A simple eyeball of the African-American unemployment rate, meanwhile, makes it clear that Trump has nothing to do with this trend.

More broadly, whether you want to characterize current economic trends as fantastic or terrible (I prefer, “They’re okay”), they simply aren’t very different from the trends we saw under Obama. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the economy grew 2.5 percent relative to where it had been a year ago. That’s better than what we saw in 2016 or 2015 but worse than what we got in 2014 and 2013. It’s also considerably lower than the 3 percent average annual growth he promised in his official budget submission, which in turn was lower than the 4 percent average annual growth he touted on the campaign trail. It’s also slightly worse than Canada or Mexico did last year.

Perhaps the clearest indication that we’re looking at a continuity recovery is a glance at annual job growth, which was decent under Trump but reflected an ongoing slowdown rather than an acceleration.

That’s not Trump’s fault.

Job growth slowed in 2017 for the same reason it slowed in 2016 — the closer we get to a full-employment economy, the fewer unemployed workers there are out there to easily rehire. But if Trump had actually delivered some kind of game-changing supply-side transformation of the American economy, he wouldn’t be stuck with that slowdown. He’s presiding over the same “steady as she goes” demand-side recovery that Obama had for his second term, and that should really be no surprise, since the Federal Reserve has remained in the same hands.

The stock boom is real — and great for globalist elites

The biggest exception to the case for continuity here is probably the stock market.

It’s true that shares soared on Obama’s watch, but that’s in part because he took over in the aftermath of a gigantic crash. Trump won the election at a time when stock market valuations were already high, and watched markets soar during the lame-duck months; they’ve only gone up since then. This market euphoria really is different from what we saw prior to 2017, and it may suggest something significant.

Exactly what that might be isn’t entirely clear. The 2017 stock market boom was a fully global phenomenon. It was actually Argentina whose exchange posted the highest gains, and the US stock market has slightly underperformed Japan’s Nikkei 225 index since Trump’s inauguration. The Hong Kong stock exchange is at an all-time high, as are the major indexes of India, South Korea, Germany, and a range of other countries.

Meanwhile, Robert Shiller, the Yale economist who’s spent a lifetime studying asset price bubbles, reports that American shares are the most expensive in the world relative to underlying corporate earnings. That could mean our stock market is massively overvalued, or it could reflect expectations that a pro-business regime in Washington is going to find a way to tilt the playing field even more strongly in favor of shareholders over workers and consumers.

In his inaugural address, Trump promised to champion the little guy, saying “the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.”

The reality of the stock market boom, however, is that it means an explosion of inequality. Economist Edward Wolff has calculated that nearly 40 percent of the market is owned by the richest 1 percent of the population, with the next 9 percent accounting for a bit more than 40 percent. The bottom 90 percent of the population owns just 19 percent of stock market wealth.

None of which is to say that a booming stock market is bad, only that it doesn’t do much to concretely impact the life of the average person or contradict the basic reality that labor market and GDP growth data show broad continuity with the Obama era.

Is America great now?

Hillary Clinton struggled to articulate a boosterish case for the American economy during the 2016 campaign in part because of lingering patches of labor market weakness but largely because progressives have a more fundamental critique of the US economic situation.

The United States is the only high-income country to have millions of citizens who lack health insurance, has a relative child poverty rate that’s off the charts by the standards of other developed countries, has no guaranteed paid parental leave or paid vacation, and remains one of the world’s highest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases even as the world hurtles toward an environmental crisis. Under those circumstances, efforts to pitch the notion that “America is already great” end up falling flat not just — or even especially — with skeptical swing voters but with Democrats’ own base that yearns for transformative change to aspects of the American welfare state and of American political economy.

Republicans have no such qualms. The Republican Party donor class is very, very excited about high stock market valuations (which lead directly to huge payouts for top executives) and about corporate income tax cuts (which lead to high stock market valuations, and thus huge payouts for top executives) and thus are very glad to embrace the narrative that all is now well with the American economy. That gives an incumbent Republican presiding over decent growth an easy, uncomplicated pitch to make — things are good now, and they are good thanks to me.

It’s largely forgotten now, but back during the mid-aughts (a time of more rapid wage growth than what we saw in 2017, incidentally), it was commonplace in conservative circles to proclaim that we were living through a “Bush Boom” touched off by his game-changing tax cuts and deregulation. That story, obviously, eventually ended in tears, as a poorly supervised financial system channeled inequitably shared growth into an unsustainable pyramid of debt that eventually collapsed. But they were good times while they lasted.

Perhaps this time it will be different."

At the heart of that order, it put the liberal values of free trade and the rule of law. Over the next seven decades, the order, backed by U.S. power and bolstered by its growing legitimacy among other countries, prevented most economic disputes from escalating into mutually destructive trade wars, let alone military conflict. That allowed even the smallest and poorest countries to develop their social and economic potential without having to worry about predation by stronger neighbors. By taking much of the fear out of the global economy, the U.S.-led order allowed market decisions to be driven by business, not bullying.

Today, that order is under threat. U.S. President Donald Trump has rejected the idea that the world’s economies all benefit when they play by the rules. Instead, he has decided that putting “America first” means withdrawing from supposedly bad deals, on which he believes the system is based. So far, Trump has failed to follow through on his most destructive ideas. But the damage has already begun to show. His administration has hobbled the World Trade Organization, encouraged China and other autocratic regimes to lean on their smaller neighbors for economic loyalty, undercut agreements on tax evasion and climate change, and pushed even major U.S. allies to negotiate free-trade and cross-border investment deals without the United States.

If the United States continues its retreat from economic leadership, it will impose serious pain on the rest of the world—and on itself. Unless the Trump administration chooses to launch a full-blown trade war, the consequences will not come immediately. But a sustained U.S. withdrawal will inevitably make economic growth slower and less certain. The resulting disorder will make the economic well-being of people around the world more vulnerable to political predation and conflict than it has been in decades.

WELCOME TO THE CLUB

One of the great lessons of economic history is that bullying is bad for prosperity. Good institutions—the rule of law, clear property rights, stable means of exchange, efficient tax collection, the provision of public goods, checks on official corruption—are the fundamental prerequisites for sustained economic growth. The benefits of such institutions should not be oversold. They do not lead inexorably to prosperity or democratic freedom. But without them, long-term saving and investment, which form the backbone of growth, cannot be maintained.

The U.S.-led postwar order extended these kinds of institutions to the international economic sphere, at least in part. The best way to think about the rules-based order is as a club that promotes a common set of beliefs to which its members adhere: the ability to export to, import from, and invest in markets around the world should not be determined by military power or alliance structures; other countries’ economic growth should be welcomed, not treated as a threat; property rights should be secure from invasion, expropriation, or theft; and technical knowledge should flow freely, subject to the enforcement of patents and trademarks. Together, these values provide the basis for sustained investment and business relationships, as well as household income growth.

The club offers some shared facilities, for which dues are collected. These start with the institutions founded at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944—the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and what became the World Trade Organization (WTO)—but go far beyond them. The order maintains common systems for settling transactions, converting currencies, invoicing in widely accepted units, and applying tariffs and customs rules. It also establishes forums where experts can meet to discuss specialized topics and groups that set international standards, such as ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Critically, the club’s facilities now include frameworks for settling international commercial disputes.

A sustained U.S. withdrawal will inevitably make economic growth slower and less certain.

The club includes some mutual insurance against both man-made and natural disasters. In part, this takes the form of development assistance and emergency aid, which flow disproportionately to poorer members. But it also involves cooperation in the face of financial crises or economic depression, both of which can spread if the entire community does not work together to fix problems, even if they initially affect only one member. The liquidity provided by the U.S. Federal Reserve in emergencies is essential to such financial firefighting.

The club analogy is not perfect. Although the members are nation-states, underlying each state are millions of people, households, and businesses. These, not the states’ rulers, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the global economic order. That is what gives the liberal order its ethical weight.

LEADING FROM THE MIDDLE

All these attributes are in large part the result of U.S. leadership. But if the United States chairs the club, that does not mean it can issue commands or demand loyalty. Washington cannot force a state to become a member; it can only make membership more attractive than remaining outside the club. Nor can it easily restrict what a member government does within its own country or in areas outside of the order’s agreed values, short of issuing a credible threat to kick that country out of the system. But if such threats come too often or seem too arbitrary, then other members will fear for their own status and band together to resist U.S. pressure. Finally, the United States can collect club dues only to the degree that members think that membership is worth it and that others are paying roughly their fair share.

This reality contradicts the widespread but misguided belief that the United States provides global public goods while others free-ride, let alone Trump’s view that the global system has played American voters for fools. In reality, the United States supplies by itself only two essential aspects of the economic order. First, Washington extends an umbrella of security guarantees and nuclear deterrence over U.S. allies. Second, the U.S. military ensures free navigation of the seas and airspace for commerce, subject to some international rules that are largely set by the United States. Both of these are classic public goods in that one actor, the United States, provides them, and can do so essentially on its own, and every country benefits, whether or not it contributes.

In fact, when it comes to the rest of the order’s institutions and benefits, the United States has often been the one free-riding in recent years. It has frequently failed to pay its dues to international organizations on time, as others do. It has spent a far smaller share of its GDP on aid than other wealthy countries. It has failed to respond adequately to climate change, even as other countries have begun to shift toward greener growth. It has behaved irresponsibly by excessively deregulating its financial system and its mortgage market, despite pressuring other countries to curtail their own growth for the sake of stability.

Other countries are also mostly taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s threats to the global economic system.

This reality is the opposite of the concern voiced by Trump’s “America first” slogan. The United States has been given a pass on many responsibilities precisely because it leads the system and other countries want it to keep doing so.

So far, the benefits of U.S. leadership have been large enough that other countries are willing to ignore a certain amount of hypocrisy. But at some point, if the United States goes from occasional free-riding to ostentatiously violating the rules, the system itself will be imperiled. The United States has to want to lead, and the other members have to want it to do so.

Thus, U.S. leadership is not the inevitable result of the relative size of the U.S. economy and the U.S. military. Over the last 70 years, it has persisted even as the share of the world economy made up by the U.S. economy has shrunk from 50 percent to 25 percent. Policymakers should not fear that China or the EU will replace Washington as the global economic leader as their economies surpass that of the United States. So long as the U.S. economy remains very large (which it will) and at the technological frontier (which it probably will), and the United States maintains its commitment to globally attractive values, the country will be capable of remaining the leader.

It is a tribute to the appeal of the liberal rules-based order—and to Washington’s ability to position itself as at least better than the alternative—that U.S. leadership has retained such indulgent support.

DO THEY REALLY MEAN IT?

Washington’s retreat will not immediately send the world into recession. Unless the Trump administration decides to mount an actual trade war with China or Mexico, it may not even do any obvious harm over the next year or two. This is partly because even major economic policies take time to affect economies as a whole. It is also because the global economy is in the midst of an extremely broad and balanced recovery. That breadth makes the current expansion the most resilient of any since at least the 1980s. All the engines of the world economy are running well, mostly without overreliance on debt in either the private or the public sector.

Other countries are also mostly taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s threats to the global economic system. The administration’s National Security Strategy, which was released in December, challenges almost all the fundamental aspects of the United States’ global role and the values that the country has professed for the last 70 years. It breaks down the wall between economics and national security and explicitly commits the U.S. government to bilateral bullying instead of enforcing and obeying the rules. Advancing what it calls “principled realism,” the strategy promises to “integrate all elements of America’s national power—political, economic, and military.” The United States will “pursue bilateral trade agreements” rather than broad ones, a recipe for economic coercion rather than cooperation.

Some skepticism over the Trump administration’s course is justified, since past administrations have rarely followed any stated strategy consistently. What is more, even if the document does reflect Trump’s intentions, a number of factors—the midterm elections later this year, unexpected developments from the ongoing investigations into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, pushback from Congress, even reasoned persuasion by the president’s economic advisers and world leaders—could stop the administration from following this mistaken path.

If that strategy really does guide U.S. policy, however, then it will do serious harm. The United States would restrict access to its market in a variety of arbitrary ways, by blocking foreign investment, withdrawing from trade agreements, imposing “buy American” restrictions on government purchases, and politicizing financial supervision and access to international payments systems. Inevitably, given greater political discretion over the economy, some U.S. politicians will demand payments, perhaps even bribes, from companies for proceeding with normal commercial transactions. All but the last already occur to some limited degree, but successive U.S. administrations since World War II have pushed against these tendencies at home and abroad. Reversing that approach would hurt the United States’ economic productivity and its citizens’ purchasing power. At least as important, it wouldn’t stop there. Adopting such policies would encourage autocrats to follow suit and even democratic allies to retaliate in kind.

Finally, the extent of the damage will depend on how willing and able other governments are to uphold the values and structures of the current system: China and the EU, primarily, but also other major economies that have long supported the rules-based order, such as Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico. In all likelihood, there will be no immediate disaster, because the system offers benefits to members who voluntarily comply with its rules. Even without the United States, almost all the other members of the order still publicly subscribe to its stated values: open markets, equal treatment of all members for economic purposes, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.

When politicians demand loyalty over objectivity and suppress findings they do not like, they legitimate tactics that were once the preserve of autocrats.

Some of the shift away from U.S. economic leadership predates the Trump administration. Since the global financial crisis, widespread disdain has emerged for the excesses of turbocharged Anglo-American financialized capitalism, especially its unfettered speculative flows and unchecked accumulation of private wealth. In many countries, this backlash has led to greater tolerance for state-owned enterprises (reinforced by China’s example of state-led growth), the protection of special interests from trade competition, and the promotion of companies with their headquarters in their home country as national champions. All of these can have positive effects in moderation, but the current trend is likely to go too far without the restraint that comes when the United States enforces the rules. Even under the Obama administration, the United States was slow to put new issues, such as women’s empowerment, refugee resettlement, Internet privacy, and environmental concerns, on the international agenda. Yet the best way to deal with these issues would be to bring other countries’ concerns about the United States’ errors to a discussion at the G-20. For other countries to give up on U.S. leadership, let alone for the United States itself to abandon the system, would only worsen these problems.

The most immediate response to the Trump administration’s retreat has come on trade. The prospect of the United States’ withdrawal from the global trading system has spurred several large economies to conclude bilateral or regional trade agreements. In the past year, the EU has all but concluded substantive trade deals with Canada, Japan, Singapore, and Vietnam, and it has accelerated negotiations with Mexico and the South American trading bloc Mercosur. With surprising speed, the 11 nations remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership after the United States withdrew in early 2017 have moved forward with much of the agreement, with Australia and Japan taking the lead. Regional trade talks in Asia and Africa involving China and negotiations among Latin American countries have also gained pace; although these types of negotiations tend to result in lower-quality agreements that would allow only limited liberalization and resolve few regulatory issues, they will divert trade from elsewhere, including the United States.

The Trump administration has begun attacking international institutions from NATO to the UN. By blocking the appointment of new trade-dispute judges to sit on the WTO’s seven-member appellate body, the administration is preventing the WTO from functioning normally. Here, the rest of the world has been slower to respond. A few world leaders, such as Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who defended the WTO at the organization’s biennial meeting in December, have spoken out. Canada has filed a WTO case against the many unilateral trade measures the Trump administration is pursuing, which may set a precedent for action by other countries. But most have remained silent, possibly because they do not wish to provoke Trump into directly withdrawing from or further attacking the organization.

Some nontrade aspects of the liberal rules-based order can continue to function in the absence of U.S. leadership. Most institutions and forums will not work as well, or as consistently, or as adaptably, but they will persist. The systems that allow international financial cooperation have been largely spared from attack so far, in part because of the Federal Reserve’s legal independence. Yet without U.S. leadership, even these regimes will be vulnerable to future economic shocks. In the event of a major downturn, large countries will likely fail to act together if the United States does not contribute. The system is not designed to withstand a full-on assault by Washington. If Trump wants to tear down the order, it will be difficult for other countries to limit the damage.

BEGGAR-THY-NEIGHBOR

Left-wing critics of the U.S.-led liberal economic order often argue that the system encourages countries to race to the bottom, exploiting poorer populations along the way. This criticism has particular merit when it comes to environmental protections and labor rights, areas in which the United States does not do enough domestically and so lowers global standards. But until recently, a combination of peer pressure and formal agreements encouraged by the United States had increasingly limited the extent to which countries undercut one another. Over the last decade, international efforts, led in part by the Obama administration working through the G-20, had begun to rein in two of the most pernicious beggar-thy-neighbor policies, currency manipulation and the creation of tax havens.

If the U.S. government walks away from its leadership role, this picture will change dramatically. Today, tax competition largely takes the form of constructive pressure to bring rates and coverage somewhat in line with those of comparable economies. The United States, along with some other countries, is disadvantaged under the current system, but only international cooperation has a hope of plugging the holes rather than just driving every country’s revenues down. If the United States tries unilaterally to use its tax code to attract corporate headquarters away from other countries, the incentives to race to the bottom by allowing tax evasion will strengthen. The tax bill signed by Trump in December has many complex provisions, but overall, it appears to privilege domestic production in a way likely to both reduce economic efficiency and promote tax conflict internationally.

More broadly, either opportunistic multinational companies will pit countries against one another as governments compete to attract jobs or countries will designate national champions that will demand protection and subsidies. Either way, companies’ shareholders will capture more of national incomes, shifting resources away from individual taxpayers and workers and shrinking governments’ abilities to deal with social issues and invest in long-term projects. Beggar-thy-neighbor policies will beggar everyone.

Another goal of the postwar liberal order was to give the governments of developing countries a voice. Global governance has never been truly equal; the United States and other major countries have always played a dominant role. And deadlock often stymies institutions in which all member countries have an equal vote, such as at the WTO. But the IMF, the World Bank, and other multilateral development institutions have generally applied consistent criteria across countries when apportioning lending and aid, authorized by their collective membership.

In contrast, in a world in which national security links and bilateral relationships displace general rules and multilateral institutions, aid and crisis financing will grow increasingly politicized. Whether a developing country gets access to financing might come to depend on whether it sits inside a major country’s sphere of influence and is willing to accept (or unable to resist) political domination by that country. The IMF and the World Bank will remain, but without backing from rich countries, they will likely not be able to counterbalance this kind of politicization in large parts of the world.

To avoid facing such political pressures, many emerging-market countries will make renewed attempts to hedge against situations in which they need assistance by keeping larger currency reserves, even if that comes at the cost of domestic investment. They will also try to secure patrons who will promise them relatively unconditional assistance when it is needed. With those promises in hand, countries will have less need of help from international institutions and thus will be more willing to keep international monitors out of their decisions. This combination will make financial crises more frequent and, by interfering with international cleanup efforts, more likely to do lasting political and economic damage. The division between middle-income countries and countries that remain poor will grow even starker as inconsistencies in the system will hurt the poorest and smallest countries the most.

THE POST-REALITY ECONOMY

Less obvious but no less destructive effects of the U.S. withdrawal from economic leadership will come on the macroeconomic side. These have begun with recent efforts to compromise economic statistics. The United States has always taken pride in the fact that it relies on independent agencies to report data about its economy. That has allowed it to press other countries to disclose information properly and promptly, given rise to a set of definitions and techniques to help them do so, and created the basis for formal agreements on economic surveillance among technocrats. Objective, standardized economic data allow policymakers to adjust their policies based on more than gut feelings or salesmanship. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the IMF, with strong support from the United States, help develop and maintain this statistical regime; their regular reports on member countries’ policies and performance give voters and investors independent expert assessments to consider.

Yet over the past year, British and U.S. politicians have begun to disparage their own technocrats’ findings. In London, government ministers have dismissed official agencies’ skeptical analyses of Brexit, and in Washington, Republican members of Congress have rejected legally required assessments of legislation by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. In some cases, they have even attempted to prevent analyses and data from being released to the public. Politicians will always present numbers in a rosy light and push back against criticism, often with some justification. But when they demand loyalty over objectivity and suppress findings they do not like, they legitimate tactics that were once the preserve of autocrats. Other self-interested politicians will follow this lead. It is impossible to put a number on the damage this could do by allowing wrong-headed policies, distorting and deterring investment by raising uncertainty, and reducing the ability of publics to hold their governments accountable.

As the United States turns away from the liberal rules-based order and economic decisions grow more intertwined with political power, uncertainty will rise and returns on investment will fall. Governments will work to trap investment at home, either to create domestic jobs or to fund a corrupt political system. Those efforts will always come at an economic cost. If they did not, governments would not have to prevent money from flowing abroad. Policies that restrict foreigners’ ability to invest in a particular country are more of a mixed bag. Limits on some kinds of foreign investment can help prevent destabilizing surges of capital into and out of economies. But such policies can easily go too far since foreign direct investment brings a wide range of benefits for advanced and developing economies alike.

If governments begin to restrict capital flows, investors will find it harder to diversify their investments across the global economy. That will expose households and businesses to greater losses from volatility within their particular country or region. Laws that make it more difficult for households to get their savings into or out of an economy will reduce the level of investment and shift it toward more liquid assets, such as cash and government bonds. Worthwhile business ventures will struggle to raise capital.

Wealthy but aging societies in Europe, North America, and Northeast Asia need to invest in growing emerging-market countries to sustain their retirement incomes. Emerging economies need investment from wealthier countries to build roads, bridges, and hospitals; develop Internet and other communications networks; and train doctors, teachers, and other professionals. But if politicians and national security threats interfere with investment between countries or among different sectors of the economy, that win-win exchange will become more tenuous, leaving both retirees and workers around the world worse off.

TRADE ON

The international free-trade regime forms the most visible—and the most reviled—aspect of the postwar economic order. But it is here that U.S. withdrawal might actually do the least harm. The United States is more dispensable to the rules-based trading regime than it is in other economic spheres, and the other major trading countries are responding to U.S. withdrawal by deepening their own trade agreements. International trade has persisted throughout recorded human history, even when some global economies have left the system (as China did from the mid-fifteenth century to the mid-eighteenth century, Japan did from the mid-seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century, and the Soviet Union did throughout its existence). Trade can be limited, but never completely squelched.

U.S. withdrawal will still hurt. Countries have already begun to shift their trade flows, supply chains, and business relations away from the U.S. market. This process will only accelerate as the United States retreats. Although the U.S. economy’s sheer size will make it impossible for other countries to completely divert trade around it, that size will also worsen the global economic losses from the United States’ withdrawal.

If the United States entirely abandons the global free-trade system, the result will be a massive reduction in the size of global markets. That would leave consumers with less variety and worse quality in the products they buy, leave companies less able to take advantage of economies of scale, and leave countries more likely to diverge from the common technologies and standards that make modern life possible. Global competition would wither. The United States itself would suffer as companies pursued opportunities in places where new trade deals expanded markets and the politics were more favorable. Among the biggest losers would be Americans themselves, as they would soon pay more than they do now for almost everything and miss out on the new jobs and growth that would otherwise have come from the rise of developing economies.

It is on trade that U.S. withdrawal might actually do the least harm.

As the leader of the global economic order, the United States has, albeit insufficiently, pushed to enshrine tougher standards for anticorruption, environmental protection, and human rights in major trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There is still room for improvement, but trade deals without the United States, especially those that include China but not the EU, will likely score far worse on all these counts. Even the EU may compromise more readily than before when it becomes the leading high-income economy in the global trading system. Without the United States to counterbalance it, Brussels will be tempted to sell out its values for economic gain. It may restrict the spread of biotechnologies and agricultural innovations, as many EU countries have an anti-science opposition to them; attempt to split up the Internet in order to advantage European companies in search, shopping, and social networking; and acquiesce to demands from Beijing to transfer militarily useful technology or recognize its territorial claims in return for preferential access to Chinese markets. The United States has sometimes failed to stand on principle on these matters, but U.S. leadership with European support remains the only way to make any progress on such issues. Otherwise, the incentives for each major economy will be to pander and compromise.

THE HOUSE THAT WE BUILT

The United States has at times failed to live up to its ideals as the leader of the liberal economic system. That failure has grown more frequent since 9/11, as many Americans have felt threatened by the growth of terrorism and the economic rise of China. That trend also reflects a recurrent nativism in the U.S. electorate and Congress that predates—and contributed to—Trump’s election. The United States has played too dominant a role in some areas of global economic discussion and been reluctant to allow other countries to help set the agenda, partly in an effort to pander to domestic nationalists by maintaining the symbolism of dominance. But far worse than a lackluster leader is one that abandons its role altogether or even works actively to subvert the system’s values. A return to bullying would only harm economic growth.

The United States’ motivation for building the postwar economic system was as much preventing conflict as promoting growth. In setting out the rules by which all members would conduct business, the architects of the system hoped to separate economic from military competition. U.S. withdrawal need not result in economic or physical wars, but it will raise the risk of stumbling into conflict by accident. Without agreed-on rules, even minor economic disputes have the potential to set off escalating counterattacks. If the norm of separation between economic and military confrontations breaks down, economic frictions, such as Chinese theft of intellectual property or restrictions on trade with a nuclear Iran or North Korea, could turn into outright conflict.

It is plausible that as the United States retreats and thereby weakens its economy, the Trump administration will blame the economic damage not on its own actions but on foreign governments, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of anger. When other major countries step forward to preserve the open economic order, or defend themselves against U.S. economic aggression, Washington may interpret that as an attack on U.S. primacy. The Trump administration might even misinterpret the current forbearance by China or the EU as a sign of weakness and an invitation to escalate confrontations.

Today, a smaller share of the world’s population than ever lives in poverty, and a larger share than ever lives a middle-class existence. This is not solely the result of China’s astonishing rise. In Chile, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, economic growth has brought hundreds of millions of people out of what amounted to subsistence or little better. This miracle took place without conquest or even much conflict, and with greater protections for private property and human rights than ever before. The liberal order constructed and led by the United States made such progress possible by giving countries, businesses, and individuals the opportunity to build their economic lives without fear of a foreign power taking away what they had made. That U.S. leadership has not, as some have charged, hurt the United States. The country’s rampant inequality and wage stagnation are largely the result of domestic political choices and failures. A world in which the United States ceases to lead—or, worse still, attacks—the system it built will be poorer, nastier, less fair, and more dangerous for everyone."
211,Trump hopes to negotiate with California on fuel economy standards - CBS News,Trump hopes to negotiate with California on fuel economy standards  CBS News,"Sat, 12 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdHJ1bXAtaG9wZXMtdG8tbmVnb3RpYXRlLXdpdGgtY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1vbi1mdWVsLXN0YW5kYXJkcy_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90cnVtcC1ob3Blcy10by1uZWdvdGlhdGUtd2l0aC1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLW9uLWZ1ZWwtc3RhbmRhcmRzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CBS News,"Addressing a key concern for manufacturers, President Trump instructed his administration to explore negotiations with California on achieving a single fuel economy standard for the nation during a meeting with auto industry executives.

The president met with top auto executives Friday to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions.

The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs.

A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months.

Executives from auto companies met with Mr. Trump and cabinet officials on Friday. Embattled EPA chief Scott Pruitt was also there when the president responded to a question about whether he still has confidence in Pruitt.

Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Mr. Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis.""

During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards.

The EPA under Mr. Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025.

The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard.

If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales.

Any big change by Mr. Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states.

In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard.

""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said.

Mr. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina.

As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan.

Mr. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily.

Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens.""

""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable.""

Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices.

When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales.

Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump.

Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said.

Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars.

Auto executives attending the meeting included Marchionne, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett and Bob Carter, executive vice president of North America for Toyota.

There’s little doubt that the economy is doing well. Regular readers of The Fact Checker know we automatically award Two Pinocchios to anyone who gives sole credit to a president for economic improvements. That’s because the U.S. economy is complex, and the decisions of companies and consumers often loom larger than the acts of government.

That hasn’t stopped President Trump from trying to take credit. He called the economy a disaster during the campaign. Now, he brags about the low unemployment rate, the positive jobs reports, the booming stock market and growth in the gross domestic product. He often attributes the good numbers to the tax bill he pushed through Congress, his deregulatory agenda and growing business confidence under his tenure.

Trump claims that every time he meets a foreign leader, they congratulate him on “the incredible job [he’s] done with the United States economy.” He claimed he’s created the “best economy in U.S. history” nearly 50 times in three months, earning Three Pinocchios in the process.

This boasting has apparently begun to annoy Obama, who argues that Trump is simply surfing off the economy that emerged after the Great Recession — which was going on when Obama took the oath of office.

The White House did not respond to a specific question about Trump’s assertion of an economic turnaround, but an official did provide data making the case that Trump exceeded expectations for the economy at the time of Obama’s departure.

We’ve previously compared U.S. economic performance under Obama and under Trump during Trump’s first year in office. But overseeing a strong economy is not the same as accomplishing a “turnaround.” Can Trump take credit? Or did today’s trends start before he took office?

The Facts

There isn’t one factor alone that makes an economy “good” or “bad.” A thriving economy is felt (or not felt) in a multitude of ways. Let’s examine a variety of measures looking at where the economy was when Obama took office, when Trump took office and where it is now.

Jobs

Trump regularly (and incorrectly) brags he’s added 4 million jobs since taking office. Regular readers may remember we gave the president Two Pinocchios for claiming that he created 1 million jobs about six months into his term.

Advertisement

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy added 2,188,000 jobs in 2017 — Trump’s first year in office. So far, it has added 1,306,000 jobs in 2018. But the economy added more jobs in every year of Obama’s second term than it did in Trump’s first year. This holds true when examining the average number of jobs added per month. (We are counting average monthly jobs created from February to January because the January data is collected the week of Jan. 12, before a president takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.)

The monthly numbers suggest Trump is continuing an existing trend. But a White House official argues this is unfair because the nation is at full employment. Before Trump’s election, the official noted, the Congressional Budget Office at the start of 2017 predicted job growth of about 160,000 per month in the first half of 2017, 116,000 per month in the second half of 2017 and 94,000 jobs per month in 2018. So Trump is doing much better than CBO’s 2017 estimates.

Unemployment rate

The unemployment rate is the best it has been in a decade, holding steady at 3.9 percent in August. Shortly after Trump took office in February 2017, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent. It has declined at a faster pace than the Congressional Budget Office predicted at the beginning of Trump’s term, but the unemployment rate had already stabilized. It was ranging between 4.6 and 5 percent starting in August 2015. That represents over a five-point decline since unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, nine months after Obama took office.

During the campaign, Trump argued that this measure was “totally fiction;” this argument earned him Four Pinocchios. He often pointed to people who had given up looking for work to back up his claim. Looking at another variation of the unemployment rate, the U6 number, which takes this into account, unemployment was 7.4 percent in August, down from 9.2 percent when Trump took office. Still, that’s a far cry from its peak — 17.1 percent in October 2009.

Employment in population (ages 25-54)

Another indicator of economic growth is the percentage of people employed during their prime working years. In December 2009, right before the end of Obama’s first year in office, 74.8 percent of adults between 25 and 54 were employed. The years 2010 and 2011 marked the indicator’s low points, averaging 75.1 percent each year. But by the time Obama left office, that yearly average had rebounded to 77.9 percent. The ratio continued to climb through 2017, averaging 78.6 percent for the year, and 2018 is on track to be the best year in a decade.

Stock market

Share this article Share

During the 2016 campaign, Trump said the stock market was “in a big, fat bubble.” (Stocks have been rising steadily since March 2009.) But once he took office, he was first to point out any record-setting days. As we’ve previously noted, Trump regularly cites data from the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 U.S. “blue chip” companies. But the Standards & Poor’s 500 stock index provides a more nuanced data set. Comparing the S&Ps performance with similar markets since just before Trump took office, the S&P 500 (represented by the dark blue line) narrowly edged out Japan’s Nikkei 225 index (represented by the purple line) for the largest percentage of overall growth, while the German and British markets declined (light blue and pink lines, respectively). As of midyear, the Japanese and German markets had kept pace with the United States, but in recent months, the U.S. stock market has posted gains that have put it ahead.

GDP growth

Over the course of Obama’s first year in office, GDP dropped 2.5 percent. In 2010, GDP growth recovered, surging 2.5 percent. Growth was already positive when Trump took office, jumping from 1.6 percent in 2016 to 2.2 percent in 2017. Trump might point us to quarterly GDP growth. The economy is estimated to have gained 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018, but that still pales in comparison with the 5.1 percent and 4.9 percent growth in the second and third quarters of 2014 under Obama.

Still, Trump has beaten the expectations set by the Obama administration, which at the start of 2017 predicted growth of 2.4 percent in 2017 (fourth quarter to fourth quarter) and 2.3 percent in 2018. The big difference is Trump’s tax cuts and the huge spending bill he signed, which economists estimate added almost 1 percent in short-term GDP growth. Most forecasters did not raise long-run growth projection after passage of the tax cut; falling unemployment rates make it even more difficult to sustain economic growth at the current level.

Another measure of an economy’s health is the deficit-to-GDP ratio. In other words, how much a country is earning vs. how much it is spending. The measure ballooned to 9.8 percent in 2009 when the recession was at its peak and the stimulus act was passed. By 2016, it had gone down to 3.1 percent. In Trump’s first year, it went up to 3.4 percent. That’s unusual, because the economy is doing well, but it reflects the impact of Trump’s tax cut on government revenue. The increase in the federal deficit may make it hard for the government to respond to the next economic crisis. So if Trump is taking credit for the impact of the tax cut on economic growth, he needs to accept blame for the boost in the deficit.

Wages

Wage growth is one of those instances where just because Trump repeats a statistic a lot doesn’t make it accurate. Regular readers may remember Trump earning Four Pinocchios for his claim that “wages are now, for the first time in many years, rising.”

Seven months after that fact check, our conclusion is largely the same. Real median wages for all workers have been steadily increasing since 2014. In the last quarter of 2017, they plunged below their rate when Trump took office but have since recovered to about the same level. In other words, after an initial bump, wages are basically where Obama left them.

Poverty

The poverty rate isn’t something that Trump claims as a turnaround — or talks much about. A recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows the official poverty rate dropped 0.4 percentage points in 2017 to 12.3 percent. This marks the third consecutive annual decline, having fallen 2.5 points since 2014. Again, the trend that formed during Obama’s last years continued through Trump’s first.

Advertisement

And, as we’ve noted before, scholars increasingly believe that the official poverty estimate is a bit misleading and not especially informative. This is in large part because transfer payments — like the Earned Income Tax Credit or food stamps — are not recorded as income, so their impact isn’t incorporated into the official figure. To assuage these concerns, the Census Bureau introduced a second poverty measure in 2011 — the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). (This also has critics.) The SPM is declining at a slower rate than the official poverty rate, dropping 2.2 points since its peak.

Trump has, however, started to brag about the number of people coming off food stamps, as shorthand for people getting back to work and out of poverty. But experts say the decline isn’t entirely due to better economic times. Many states have rolled back waivers that relaxed work requirements during the recession and allowed people to collect benefits for longer periods of time. There have also been reports that undocumented immigrants with children who are American citizens have stopped applying for federal assistance for fear of Trump’s immigration policies.

Business investment

Business investment plunged to a low in the fourth quarter of 2015, but it rebounded to 2010 levels by the time Trump took office. It has continued to climb — gaining 2.6 percentage points, but that tracks with the upward momentum that started at the end of Obama’s term. In 2017, however, the pickup was entirely in the oil and gas sector and related to rising oil prices — just as the slow investment growth in 2015 and 2016 was just in oil/gas and related to low oil prices. In 2018, the pickup has been more widespread. As with stock prices, business investment has spiked around the world.

The Pinocchio Test

Many of the eight factors we examined tell a common story — the start of Trump’s economy follows the trend set by the last years of Obama’s economy. We’ll keep an eye out as the president’s policy changes — from tariffs to taxes — settle into the U.S. and global markets, but as of now, Trump is still working off the base Obama built.

We’ve said before that anyone who gives sole credit to a president for economic gains receives an automatic Two Pinocchios — and Trump’s claim of a historic turnaround is worthy of more. The historical books are going to view the actions taken in 2008 and 2009 by George W. Bush and Obama — and the Federal Reserve — as pivotal to saving the U.S. economy.

Trump, however, has exceeded expectations on jobs and economic growth that were in place at the start of 2017. That’s due in part because of his tax cut, but also because of factors largely beyond his control, such as the increase in oil prices. The real test will be whether the current trajectory is sustainable.

That’s a slowdown from 4.2 percent GDP growth in the previous three months, but a solid gain and the latest sign of stable economic productivity.

The latest figures give President Donald Trump — who has frequently promised at least 4 percent GDP growth– something to point to as evidence that his policies are helping the economy. Trump has also credited the GOP tax law with boosting economic growth.

The GDP report also comes at a good time for Trump and Republicans, as the party fights to hold onto control of the House and Senate in the midterm elections. The report was one of the last major economic indicators before Election Day (there will be one more jobs report released Nov. 2).

But none of this is unexpected.

As the chart below shows, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the U.S. economy would grow 3.3 percent this year. That estimate seems right on track: the economy has grown by an average of 3.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2018.

Two of the main reasons for the boost are a rise in government defense spending, as well as consumer spending, which jumped 4 percent in the third quarter. Americans are buying more because of increasing wages, a lower unemployment rate and the new tax law Trump signed in December that slashed corporate taxes and lowered income tax rates for many individuals.

“When tax cuts put money in people’s pockets, they are likely to spend it,” said William Gale, the co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Americans are expected to see their taxes reduced by $1,600 on average this year, with most of those cuts going to households making between $308,000 and $733,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

But there is a big difference in how tax cuts affect economic growth in the short run versus the long run, Gale added.

The chart indicates that real GDP growth (“real” means adjusted for inflation) is expected to drop significantly in the long run.

The Congressional Budget Office points to several reasons for that: the expiration of personal income tax cuts, slower growth in federal spending, and higher interest rates and prices.

The individual tax cuts in the GOP law are set to end in 2025, although Republicans have proposed making them permanent.

The other main problem is that gap you see in the chart between GDP (the amount the economy is actually producing) and potential GDP (what an economy could produce when it is operating at its highest potential).

Real GDP can be higher than real potential GDP if the economy gets extra stimulus from government spending or tax cuts.

But higher real GDP is good, right? Well, not always, because having GDP growth above potential GDP typically leads to higher prices, also known as inflation. If inflation isn’t kept in check, it can feed on itself in an upward spiral — what’s known as wage-price inflation.

Gale compared that stimulus to having too much coffee.

Trump has said the Federal Reserve is the biggest risk to the U.S. economy.

“If you are tired in the afternoon, that will get you through the rest of the day, but a steady diet of sugar and caffeine is not healthy,” he said.

The last time inflation spiked in the 1970s, it led to the Federal Reserve hitting the brakes hard on economic growth, and a sharp recession followed.

The Federal Reserve typically tries to steer a middle course between runaway growth that fuels inflation and slow growth that doesn’t create enough jobs. Right now, the Fed is raising interest rates to keep inflation in check, a clear sign of concern the economy could overheat. (In a series of unusual attacks, Trump has denounced the Fed’s recent rate hikes and claimed the central bank is the “biggest risk” to the U.S. economy.)

Conservative analysts said they weren’t too worried about inflation because the new tax law is meant to encourage investment, not just spending.

“If businesses are investing in new pieces of equipment, it is making them more efficient and that can lead to lower prices on the widget that is being produced,” said Adam Michel, a economic and fiscal policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

In the end, simultaneous spikes in investment and consumer spending could balance each other out, leaving the price of most goods largely unchanged.

But that assumes companies will invest their tax cuts in new equipment and facilities. So far, much of the money from the tax cuts is not going directly to investments, but instead to stock buybacks, something Democrats predicted in their opposition of the bill.

There is another threat to future real GDP growth as well: tariffs. Exports spiked in the second quarter because producers were trying to sell their products before the Trump administration’s new tariffs — on goods like steel and electronics from China and other countries — kicked in. Those exports dropped in the third quarter and could continue to drop if the tariffs remain in place.

The upshot: the overall economy remains strong, for now. Unemployment is low. Wages are starting to tick up. The question is how long it can last."

He’s tweeted anti-immigrant ads and threatened to revoke birthright citizenship, something lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said would be unconstitutional, as he campaigns to drive up Republican turnout.

In a Thursday speech, Trump, a vocal critic of illegal immigration long before he reached the White House, claimed it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year.

“Illegal immigration hurts Americans workers, burdens American taxpayers and undermines public safety, and places enormous strains on local schools, hospitals and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most,” Trump said.

Immigration has an overall positive impact on the long-run economic growth in the U.S.

While Trump’s rhetoric has lately focused on unauthorized immigrants, his policies have targeted legal immigration as well. Under his administration, refugee admissions in 2017 dropped to their lowest since at least 2002. Trump signed an executive order tightening restrictions on HB1 visas for skilled immigrants. He has pushed for a merit-based immigration system, and his administration has proposed cutting public benefits to legal immigrants.

Trump’s characterization of immigrants, as people who drain public resources, however, is not backed by the data. Unauthorized immigrants aren’t usually eligible for federal benefits, for instance, and multiple studies have found that immigrants help the economy grow.

READ MORE: Trump retweets false claim on immigrant aid

Here are some of the most widespread myths about how immigrants affect the U.S. economy, and the research that refutes them.

Myth #1: Immigrants take more from the U.S. government than they contribute

Fact: Immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they take in government benefits

A 2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found immigration “has an overall positive impact on the long-run economic growth in the U.S.”

How that breaks down is important.

First-generation immigrants cost the government more than native-born Americans, according to the report — about $1,600 per person annually. But second generation immigrants are “among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S.,” the report found. They contribute about $1,700 per person per year. All other native-born Americans, including third generation immigrants, contribute $1,300 per year on average.

It is difficult to determine the exact cost or contribution of unauthorized immigrants because they are harder to survey, but the study suggests they likely have a more positive effect than their legal counterparts because they are, on average, younger and do not qualify for public benefits.

It’s also important to note that less-educated immigrants tend to work more than people with the same level of education born in the U.S. About half of all U.S.-born Americans with no high school diploma work, compared to about 70 percent of immigrants with the same education level, Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, said in a recent interview with PBS NewsHour.

WATCH:Proposed immigration policy penalizes legal residents for use of public benefits

In general, more people working means more taxes — and that’s true overall with undocumented immigrants as well. Undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $11.6 billion a year in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy.

Undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $11.6 billion a year in taxes.

Immigrants are also less likely to take public benefits than the native-born population for two reasons.

First, to receive most public benefits under the social safety net, immigrants must be lawful permanent residents for at least five years.

There are approximately 9 million immigrants that fit that definition in the U.S. Of those, many would not qualify for welfare or other programs because their incomes are too high.

Speaking at events Thursday in Iowa and Illinois, Trump claimed victory in advance of Friday’s government release of quarterly gross domestic product data, saying “nobody thought we were going to be this great” and that when he became president, “those numbers were bad.”

In fact, the skepticism from economists has centered more on whether strong GDP growth would be sustainable after a few quarters. That question has yet to be answered; it’s not unusual for the economy to surge forward temporarily.

Trump also falsely repeated a claim that the U.S. economy is the best “we’ve ever had” and incorrectly asserted that Canada’s trade market is “totally closed.”

A look at the claims:

TRUMP: “We’re having the best economy we’ve ever had in the history of our country.” — remarks in Granite City, Illinois.

THE FACTS: Even allowing for some Trumpian exaggeration, this overstates things.

The unemployment rate is near a 40-year low and growth is solid, but by many measures the current economy trails other periods in U.S. history. Average hourly pay, before adjusting for inflation, is rising at about a 2.5 percent annual rate, below the 4 percent level reached in the late 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as it is now.

Pay was growing even faster in the late 1960s, when the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for nearly four years. And economic growth topped 4 percent for three full years from 1998 through 2000, an annual rate it hasn’t touched since.

TRUMP, on GDP figures: “On Friday, numbers come out and I don’t know what they are, but there are predictions from 3.8 to 5.3. … Nobody thought we were going to be this great. … When I took over those numbers were bad, and they were heading in the wrong direction, because of regulation. Really the taxes were too high … jobs were, forget it.” — remarks at workforce event in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: Economists do expect a strong number for growth in the April-June quarter, but it is likely to be a temporary bounce. And the U.S. economy wasn’t doing nearly as bad before Trump took office as he suggests.

Few economists doubted that growth could accelerate after the Trump administration’s tax cuts were passed last year, and Congress approved a big increase in government spending earlier this year.

But the skepticism Trump describes centers on whether the second quarter’s outsize growth can be sustained. The economy faces two significant structural drags: an aging population, which means fewer people are working and more are retired, and weak productivity growth, which means that those who are working aren’t increasing their output as quickly as in the past.



President Donald Trump discussed trade in Granite City, Illnois, on Thursday. Watch his remarks in the player above.

Trump’s tax cuts can stimulate faster growth by putting more money in people’s pockets, but most economists expect the effect will be temporary, as those two trends act like gravity and pull the economy’s longer-term growth lower.

When the Commerce Department releases the growth figures for the April-June quarter Friday morning, economists forecast they will show the economy expanded at a 4.1 percent annual rate, according to data provider FactSet. Some analysts have said the figure could reach as high as 5 percent.

Americans have ramped up their spending after cutting back in the first three months of the year, encouraged by tax cuts that have left more money in their pockets. Yet the tax cuts provide a one-time lift to take-home pay and will likely have less impact next year, analysts say.

A large, temporary surge in agricultural exports, specifically soybeans, should also juice growth in the second quarter. Exports of U.S. soybeans soared as companies sought to ship them to China before that country slapped tariffs on them in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, forecast that soybean exports alone likely boosted GDP by 0.5 percentage point in the second quarter.

Many economists forecast growth will drop back to roughly 2.5 percent to 3 percent in the third quarter.

For the year, the economy is likely to expand at a 3 percent pace or more for the first time since 2005. But most economists forecast it will fall back below 3 percent soon afterward.

It’s not unusual for the economy to surge forward temporarily. Growth reached 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014, before falling back to 2 percent in the next quarter.

Growth also wasn’t as bad when he took office as Trump claims. The economy expanded 2.9 percent in 2015, though it slowed the following year. Businesses added 2.3 million jobs in 2016, before Trump took office, more than the 2.2 million gained in 2017.

TRUMP: “The Canadians you have a totally closed market … they have a 375 percent tax on dairy products, other than that it’s wonderful to deal. And we have a very big deficit with Canada, a trade deficit.” — remarks in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: No, it’s not totally closed. Because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada’s market is almost totally open to the United States. Each country has a few products that are still largely protected, such as dairy in Canada and sugar in the United States.

Trump also repeated his claim that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, but that is true only in goods. When services are included, such as insurance, tourism, and engineering, the U.S. had a $2.8 billion surplus with Canada last year.

Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Peosta, Iowa, and Granite City, Ill., and Hope Yen, Darlene Superville and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.

Among the wins Trump is set to highlight is the economy. But how much of the strong economy can really be attributed to an administration’s first year? Economists say the president’s regular tweets claiming responsibility for the booming stock market and low unemployment are a bit of a stretch.

“The state of the economy is naturally much more influenced by what happened before you became president,” said Alan Blinder, who was a member of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors and is now an economics professor at Princeton. He said that as a presidency progresses, and policies have time to take effect, that balance shifts.

For example, the low unemployment under the Trump administration is a continuation of a trend that goes back to 2009. Blinder said there is an argument to be made, though, for Trump having some influence on the stock market.

“I find it believable that when you get a president who tells the public and the business community that he’s going to cut their taxes … and he tells you he’s going to deregulate, drop all kinds of regulations, it’s quite a reasonable supposition to think that that pushes the stock market higher,” said Blinder.

Lee Branstetter, who served on President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, said there’s generally a built-in lag between new policies and their impact on the broader economy. Usually, around six months to a year after a major piece of legislation.

“The president really hasn’t had much time or much opportunity to implement policies that are significant enough and impactful enough to really move the needle in terms of economic growth,” said Branstetter, who is now a professor of Economics at Carnegie Mellon University.

Trump’s first major policy accomplishment was the new tax law, just passed last month. And though there have been some announcements of bonuses and companies bringing money back to the U.S., it’s still going to take a while for the effects of the law to filter through the broader economy.

Trump will likely use the State of the Union address as a chance to set the narrative that the continuation of positive news for the economy is due to his administration. A recent Gallup poll found 56 percent of Americans credit Obama for the “improved U.S. economy,” compared to 49 percent who credit President Trump."

Could that affect the economy? | Reuters/Leah Millis

Could Donald Trump’s chaotic management style scare the economy into a downturn?

Probably not. But if the economy does hit a rough patch, warns Nicholas Bloom at Stanford Graduate School of Business, the president’s volatility is likely to make things worse.

Bloom, a professor of economics, has been studying the economic impact of “uncertainty shocks” for years. He is also a co-creator, with Steven J. Davis at the University of Chicago and Scott Baker at Northwestern University, of the much-followed Economic Policy Uncertainty Index.

One of Bloom’s key conclusions is that uncertainty shocks, including uncertainty about economic policy, amplify the impact of a downturn.

And President Trump, says Bloom, has clearly elevated the level of uncertainty.

“Whether you love or loathe Trump’s policies, it is clear that he is unpredictable,” he says. “He changes his mind often and changes his advisors even faster. That makes him the most unpredictable president in recent times.”

If the economy hits a pothole, for whatever reason, Trump’s unpredictability is likely to paralyze investors and corporations even more than usual. But even if the economy doesn’t tank, Bloom says, the unpredictability will take a toll.

“He’s increased the level of uncertainty,” he says. “That’s going to edge down long-term growth, and it’s very easy to understand why. If you’re a firm making long-run investments in R&D projects or in hiring and training, those investments become less attractive as uncertainty goes up.”

In a new paper, Bloom and four colleagues estimate that a severe uncertainty shock can reduce Gross Domestic Product by as much as 2.5% — a very big hit, given that U.S. economic growth barely averages 3% a year.

The initial shock to an economy can be sparked by something basic, like a housing slump or drop in consumer demand. But uncertainty amplifies the original blow, because businesses hold back on investing and hiring, which depresses economic activity even more. Uncertainty also undermines productivity growth, which is the bedrock of economic growth, because it slows the reallocation of capital to more productive uses. Strong companies stop expanding, but weak ones stop contracting too — everybody becomes paralyzed, like deer caught in headlights.

Strong but Skittish Market

To be sure, U.S. economic growth has been strong and the stock market has surged since Trump’s election. But Trump has repeatedly jolted investors, especially with his bellicose push for tariffs on imports against trade partners from China and Canada to the European Union.

The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which scores uncertainty by tabulating news coverage, indicates that uncertainty about trade policy has shot up five-fold since 2015 and has become a major driver of rising policy uncertainty.

Trump’s tariffs, and his threats of bigger ones to come, have repeatedly roiled the stock markets. On seven days in the first half of 2018, according to an analysis by Steve Liesman of CNBC, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by an average of 1.7% in response to announcements by Trump of new tariffs. Those drops added up to a combined drop of $700 billion in market value. And though stock prices generally bounced back, the uncertainty remains high.

Unfortunately, Bloom predicts, policy uncertainty is likely to keep climbing in the United States and in many other nations.

“In the last five years, politics have been the main driver of uncertainty, and it’s been driven by the rise of backlash against populist leaders,” he says. “I think this all stems from rising inequality — people are angry and vote for more radical politicians. If inequality does not subdue, I do not see this changing. If you have 50% of the population seeing no gains from free market capitalism, they will naturally vote for anti-establishment politicians.”"
226,Trump lags behind his predecessors on economic growth | Brookings - Brookings Institution,Trump lags behind his predecessors on economic growth | Brookings  Brookings Institution,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb29raW5ncy5lZHUvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdHJ1bXAtbGFncy1iZWhpbmQtaGlzLXByZWRlY2Vzc29ycy1vbi1lY29ub21pYy1ncm93dGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Brookings Institution,"In recent months, President Trump has tweeted that economic growth under his presidency “is better than it has been in many decades,” “the Economy is raging at an all-time high, and is set to get even better,” and “It has been many years that we have seen these kind of (economic) numbers.”

While some hyperbole is a matter of opinion, Trump’s claim that his stewardship of the economy puts his predecessors to shame can be checked by public information that is readily available to all. In fact, the data show that compared to his predecessors, Trump’s record so far falls somewhere between unremarkable and substandard. Moreover, other economic data suggest that the current expansion will likely wind down before his term ends, and his boasting will ring hollow once the economy slips into recession.

It is commonly said that a President deserves some credit or blame for the economy’s performance only after he’s been in office about six months. On those terms, let’s measure Trump’s words against the record for real GDP growth over the last three quarters (July 2017 through March 2018). Over those quarters, GDP has grown at an annual rate of 2.6 percent. Comparing that pace to his last nine predecessors over comparable periods in their first terms, Trump here bests the four presidents who faced recessions in their first year in office (Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon). Trump’s other five predecessors came to office, as he did, during economic expansions. Among them, he’s tied for last place: Real GDP growth under Trump over the three quarters has lagged Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson and John Kennedy, and tied George H.W. Bush, as the data in the following table shows.

The Early Economic Records of Presidents from Kennedy to Trump President GDP Business Investment Investment in Equipment Kennedy 7.0% 8.3% 14.2% Johnson 6.3% 10.7% 11.9% Nixon 0.0% -1.6% -0.3% Carter 2.7% 8.2% 12.2% Reagan -2.1% 3.0% -3.0% Bush-1 2.6% 0.5% -0.2% Clinton 3.5% 7.7% 13.5% Bush-2 1.1% -4.7% -6.1% Obama 2.2% 1.5% 14.7% Trump 2.6% 5.9% 9.0%

Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis. These measures represent annual growth rates of real GDP, business fixed investment, and investment in equipment over the three quarters from each president’s third, fourth and fifth quarters in office.

Like all of those predecessors, Trump promised to reform regulation and boost business investment, because such measures can stimulate faster growth. Moreover, if the new investments focus on productivity-boosting equipment, they also can help raise people’s incomes. Through all of last year, Trump and his advisors insisted that business investment would soar once he cut onerous regulations and Congress slashed the corporate tax rate.

So, Trump devoted much of his first six months in office to rolling back regulations and much of the next months on his single major legislative achievement, sharp reductions in taxes. The table above shows what has happened to business investment generally and to new investments in equipment over the last three quarters, again compared to the results in comparable periods under his predecessors. On overall business investment, Trump’s record again beats the four presidents who faced recessions in their first year in office (Obama, Bush-2, Reagan and Nixon), plus Bush-1)—hardly a heavy lift—and trails his four other predecessors (Clinton, Carter, LBJ and JFK). On investment in equipment, the comparisons are the same except here he trails Obama as well the four other Democratic presidents since 1960.

Many economists (myself included) pointed out that Trump’s tax and regulatory changes would likely have little effect on investment. The truth is, U.S. companies had been able to borrow the funds to invest for virtually nothing for a decade, adjusting for inflation. So, there was little holding them back from investing here except a shortage of attractive opportunities, and Trump’s changes didn’t alter that reality in any meaningful way.

Trump’s middling record on GDP and investment raises the question of how much longer the current expansion, now just two months shy of entering its tenth year, can last. Developed economies move in business cycles, and so they weaken eventually as a matter of course. That’s where the United States is today. This late in any economic expansion, the pool of available workers for new jobs is modest, most attractive investment opportunities have been taken, and any pent-up consumer demand for large durable purchases has been exhausted.

No economist, much less any politician, has a test or technique to accurately predict the onset of a recession. One important reason is that a recession usually requires a shock that tips a weakening economy into a contraction. In recent decades, those shocks have come from sudden increases in oil prices, a precipitous housing decline, and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. So, Trump has to bet his reelection hopes not only on somehow getting a pass from the Mueller investigation. He also will have to trust that the Fed doesn’t double down on raising interest rates, that we can avoid a trade war and a crisis involving Korea, Syria or Iran, and that some other, yet-unforeseen development doesn’t tip the balance."

Still, the President has used the rise of the stock market as primary confirmation that his vision for the U.S. economy is working. So this week—with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing five per cent of its value in two days, though regaining a bit before the weekend—it’s hard not to ask, Is Trumponomics failing?

This is a good week to check in on Trump’s economic view of the world. He shocked the financial world—if anyone can still be shocked—by attacking the Federal Reserve. “The Fed is going wild. They’re raising rates and it’s ridiculous.” He added, “the fed is going loco.” Trump’s problem is that the Fed is raising its key interest rate, because unemployment is low and it fears an overheated economy and rising inflation. It is doing so about as slowly and carefully as possible, in accordance with the best practices of a central bank. Still, for Trump, a self-described “low-interest-rate person,” any increase at all threatens to slow economic growth just as he is hoping to win seats in the midterms. (The move could also affect his chances for reëlection in two years; Federal Reserve moves are thought to take around eighteen months or so to have an impact on the over-all economy.)

His comments came as confirmation of warnings that the International Monetary Fund issued last weekend. The I.M.F.’s World Economic Outlook provides the benchmark forecast for the global economy. It is a bureaucratic document, using careful, bloodless words to convey even the most hysterical of warnings. But readers familiar with the language of international finance can’t help but see the fear and contempt in the most recent reports. The executive summary warns, “The trade measures implemented since April will weigh on activity in 2019 and beyond; US fiscal policy will subtract momentum starting in 2020.” In regular English, this means: Trump has unilaterally launched a series of trade wars that will damage the global economy next year. Also, the tax cuts that were sold as growth-inspiring will so dramatically increase the U.S. government’s deficit that its economy will begin to slow.

It can be tempting to mock President Trump because his craven rhetoric makes him sound ignorant of basic economic principles. To be fair to him, all Presidents pursue policies that international-finance experts see as contrary to long-term growth. All Presidents boast when the economy is doing well and blame others when it fails. And all Presidents get angry at the Fed when it raises rates. They just don’t speak publicly about it and try so nakedly to manipulate the process. (President Richard Nixon pressured his Fed Chair, Arthur Burns, into keeping rates low in order to artificially boost economic growth before the 1972 election. Nixon, though, implicitly recognized the importance of Fed independence by keeping his intervention secret.)

Trump, though, stands alone among post-Second World War Presidents in describing himself not just as a steward of the economy but as a visionary tactician, a person who has unique ideas about how best to promote economic growth. And his ideas are radically different from those of recent Presidents of both parties. This is a good week in which to explore what those ideas look like in practice and to begin to describe a unified Trumpian theory of the economy.

To understand just how radical a departure Trump’s views are, it’s helpful to remember that Presidential economic thinking for the past seventy or so years has existed in a remarkably narrow band. From the late nineteen-thirties until 1980, all Presidents were, essentially, Keynesian. To absurdly oversimplify complex policies that played out over decades, this means they all believed that most decisions about how money is spent and invested should be made by the private sector, by people and companies, and that the government’s primary role was to provide clear, thoughtful rules and apply them fairly. Keynesians, such as John F. Kennedy, typically believe in government intervention as a break-this-glass-in-case-of-emergency exception. When an economy is temporarily underperforming, the government can step in, spend money, and jolt the free market back up to a healthier level. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan famously dismissed Keynesians and embraced what is known as the Chicago School of almost religious devotion to the free market, shunning interventions. Since then, Presidents have seesawed between Keynes and Chicago. Partisans seek to heighten the distinction between these economic schools, which do have major differences in policy advice and methodology. But, in contrast to Trumponomics, they appear as near twins.

Trumponomics is something else entirely. For Trump, an economy, apparently, is best run when some person with power and good sense continuously weighs in on key economic questions. It could be called an anti-theory theory. For Trump, theoretical models—no matter how well grounded in data and experience—are binding constraints that limit the President’s ability to respond however he thinks appropriate and, worse, they telegraph which policies the President will likely pursue. This is an essential difference. For past Presidents, stability and predictability were crucial. These qualities allow companies to make long-term investments, feeling confident they will pay off decades later. Stability also encourages other countries to orient their economies around the United States, knowing that its economic policies are unlikely to change dramatically, no matter who is in power.

In many ways, Trump’s views on economics are off base. Decades of research show that economies run best when there are clear and neutral rules, fairly applied. But understanding Trump’s view is important to having a sense of what our next two to six years might look like.

Some Republican leaders, I imagine, comfort themselves by picturing Trump’s erraticism as a bit of showmanship that masks an embrace of standard Republican orthodoxy. He yells at China or Canada, he insults the Fed, he doesn’t understand how our economy functions. But that’s noise. They believe that, at base, Trump is a Mitt Romney Republican: he wants low taxes and less regulation and thinks that the only way for poor and middle-class people to thrive is to ensure that the rich do so first.

This is, clearly now, a misreading. The chaos is not the aberration. It is the point. It is Trumponomics.

Consider something else we learned this week. ProPublica reported that last year Trump asked Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzō Abe to help out his donor, Sheldon Adelson, in his bid to enter the new Japanese casino market. On one hand, political leaders have always carried water for their rich donors. This is the swamp. But, with Trump, it is something more (or, possibly, something less). It is a model of governance and economics based, it seems, on impulse. Trump puts pressure on one of our closest allies so that a crony can make some money; Trump strong-arms Carrier so that a few hundred people can stay employed for a few weeks longer; Trump decides which industries and which countries should thrive and which should fail. The salient point is not consistency or theoretical rigor. It is that the world economy is governed by Trump’s whims. Trumponomics is not a steady state. It is, by its nature, constant turmoil."

He tweeted late Monday that “In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!” He followed that up Tuesday with a tweet saying the current conditions could be “the best economy in the history of our country.”

Trump did hedge, but if he’s suggesting his economy is the best ever, he’s got a problem: The numbers don’t back him up.

This is a good economy and Trump deserves some credit for it. But calling it the “greatest ever” goes too far, as it can’t top the late 1990s or the stellar growth in parts of the 1940s, 1960s and 1980s, according to key data.

There are many ways to judge an economy, but the typical measures are growth, jobs, wages, inflation and debt. Inequality also usually gets tossed into the mix.

In today’s economy, jobs are plentiful, the stock market is at record levels and confidence — both business and consumer — is high. Inflation has also remained tame. But growth, while showing signs of picking up, is still below what it was in many eras. Wage growth is also disappointing compared with what it was in prior boom times, and the deficit has also surged, which experts warn could be a drag on the economy for yeas to come.

Let’s break down the good, the so-so and the not great parts of the current economy. (And let’s add the caveat that presidents usually get more credit for good or bad economic times than they probably deserve.)

The really good: America has a lot of jobs right now

The United States has a record number of job openings and the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since April 2000. If it falls any lower (and most economists say it will), Trump would be presiding over the lowest rate since 1969 (when unemployment fell to 3.5 percent).

Unemployment is at the lowest level for African Americans since the government started measuring it in 1972, and the gap between black and white unemployment rates is the narrowest ever. Hispanic unemployment is near an all-time low, as is unemployment for Americans who have high school diplomas but didn’t attend college.

Neil Irwin of the New York Times put it this way: “We ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are.” Kevin Hassett, head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, said Tuesday, “The job market right now is about as strong as I’ve ever seen.”

While hiring has been strong for years and the trend began under President Barack Obama, 2018 has looked especially good. The monthly average job gains this year are actually faster than last year or 2016. Trump deserves some credit for that, and business leaders such as JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon say the tax cuts and deregulation under Trump have boosted their profits and spurred many companies to hire more workers.

The only drawback is that a smaller share of Americans are working now than in 2000. The labor force participation rate — a measure of the total number of people working against the total number of people who could be working — is under 63 percent now, vs. 67 percent in 2000. While some of the decline is explained by baby boomers retiring, not all of it is, raising concerns that some Americans who could work still aren't.

The good (but not great): Economic growth is picking up (but still below the 1990s)

On the campaign trail, Trump liked to call the Obama economy “weak” and “anemic.” He often pointed to 2 percent economic growth as puny and said he could achieve growth of 4 or 5 percent a year. Yet under Trump so far, the economy isn’t growing much faster than it did under Obama. In his first year in office, economy grew by 2.3 percent. It’s possible to argue that Trump’s policies had not taken effect, but the economy grew by just 2.2 percent in the first quarter of this year.

Growth is expected to pick up during the rest of 2018. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that growth will be at 3.3 percent for the year, the best since 2005, and Trump deserves some credit for that, although a global rebound has also helped. But almost no forecaster thinks that level of growth will last; most expect it to fall back down quickly.

To put it another way, growth in the Trump era looks likely to be far short of the late 1990s or 1980s, when growth averaged above 4 percent a year or much of the 1960s when growth averaged above 5 percent a year.

The disappointing: Wage growth is still lousy.

Trump has tapped into the frustration and insecurities of many American workers whose pay has been basically flat for the past two decades — or more. Once you adjust for inflation (a.k.a. cost of living), median household income in America was several thousand dollars lower in 2014 than in 2000. It has improved a tad — 2016 was the highest middle-class income on record, but it’s still barely topped the level from 1999.

The problem for Trump is that it’s not getting much better. Wage growth is still hovering around 2.6 to 2.8 percent, which is barely above inflation. That's far short of the 4 percent wage growth during much of the 1990s.

There’s optimism that Americans will finally get wage growth over 3 percent later this year. There are many signs that companies can’t find enough workers and are finally willing to pay more to get (and keep) employees. But while there are many anecdotes of companies saying they are raising pay, the official wage growth statistic for the entire country still isn’t rising much.

After Trump’s tax cuts, some companies opted to give one-time bonuses. That’s real money for employees, but it only comes once and isn’t a true wage bump.

The really disappointing: Trump’s $1 trillion deficits

As a candidate, Trump once promised to eliminate the national debt within 8 years. But projected deficits have exploded on his watch.

America’s annual government budget deficit will hit $1 trillion by 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and it’s expected to stay that high for years to come. It’s mainly driven by the tax cut Trump pushed hard for and signed in December. His team started off wanting to make it “deficit-neutral” so it would not add to the debt, but that was quickly abandoned. The end result is a tax cut that CBO estimates will add $1.9 trillion to the debt because of lost revenue and added interest costs.

On top of that, Trump pushed for more government spending, especially on the military, and he has refused to make any changes to Medicare or Social Security, the two programs that many budget hawks say must be tweaked in the coming years or else the debt will become unsustainable. He has also sought cuts to safety net programs for the poor, which could exacerbate inequality.

While debt has grown under many recent presidents, it happened during sour economic times when the government tried to spend to revive the economy and save jobs. It’s highly unusual to have this kind of buildup of debt during good economic times, and many have warned the economy could suffer down the road as the U.S. government lacks the money to help during the next downturn, let alone make needed investments in infrastructure and education.

Bottom line: Most economists call this a very solid time for the U.S. economy. Some even call it “hot” or “strong.” But they aren’t calling it history-making."

The greatest threat to President Donald Trump’s re-election bid may not be the slew of investigations closing in on his Oval Office but a possible economic slowdown. And the president knows it.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell again Monday, the latest dip in the roller coaster markets amid the strain of Trump’s trade war, rising interest rates and worries about a slowing global economy.

Trump, who has tied his political fortunes to the stock market in an unprecedented fashion, has nervously watched Wall Street, keeping an eye on the cable television ticker and barking at his aides for updates. And while he continues to talk up America’s financial might, he has repeatedly and publicly rebuked the chairman of the Federal Reserve for interest rate increases he feels could slow the economy.

Trump made his feelings clear again Tuesday, a day before the Fed is expected to raise its key interest rate for the fourth time this year.

“I hope the people over at the Fed will read today’s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B’s. Feel the market, don’t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!”

He said Monday on Twitter that “It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!”

Optimism about the economy has cooled somewhat this fall as Trump’s trade fight with China rattled the markets.

Throughout Trump’s term, the economy has been strong. And while the president credits his aggressive tax-cut package and deregulation efforts, the gains in fact began under President Barack Obama.

Optimism about the economy has cooled somewhat this fall as Trump’s trade fight with China rattled the markets.

Fond of citing job statistics and market reports, Trump has appeared highly attuned to the shift. After unnerving much of the global financial system by imposing tariffs, Trump seemed eager to ease anxiety recently, striking a trade truce with China after a dinner meeting during an international summit in Argentina. And when that move only briefly buoyed confidence, Trump set off on an erratic bout of tweeting that rocked the markets even more.

First Trump declared himself a “Tariff Man,” promising to inflict as much economic pain as possible — a move that horrified investors. A day later he sought to minimize the anxieties, saying there were “very strong signals” that China was negotiating in good faith.

“Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting,” Trump tweeted.

Stocks fell again Monday as both the Dow and the S&P 500 are on pace for their worst December performance since 1931, when they were battered during the Great Depression. As investors turned to an upcoming meeting of the Federal Reserve, its chairman, Jerome Powell, has repeatedly been the target of Trump’s wrath, as the Fed has been raising interest rates to make sure that the lowest unemployment in nearly five decades does not start pushing inflation higher. Arguing that the rate hikes hamper economic growth, Trump has openly questioned Powell’s leadership.

“I think the Fed is making a mistake. They are so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy,” the president said in October.

No longer tweeting much about the stock market, Trump has criticized Powell privately as well and has told confidants that he understands that a recession would be perilous for a president who once mused about the Dow hitting 30,000. (Its record was 26,828 in October.) Although Trump is not seriously considering making a change at the Fed, he has repeatedly insisted that his businessman background allows him to understand the economy more than Powell, according to four White House aides and outside advisers who were not authorized to discuss private conversations and who spoke on condition of anonymity.

“He thinks his legacy is going to be the guy who rebuilt and revived the U.S. economy. He’s totally focused on that,” said Stephen Moore, a former Trump campaign adviser and visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “He understands that if the economy remains strong, he’ll be re-elected. He’s completely focused on the economy. He does follow the stock market, he does follow the stock reports, he does follow the jobs report.”

The last two presidents who failed to be re-elected, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, were primarily done in by faltering economies.

Democrats considering challenging Trump in 2020 have begun putting forward their own economic plans. But a senior White House official said Trump remains confident in the economy, citing low unemployment numbers, GDP growth and growth in manufacturing jobs, among other indicators.

The official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, said Trump is watching the indicators closely and is regularly briefed by Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

“The American economy is booming,” Kudlow told The Associated Press. “While economies around the world are struggling, our economic fundamentals are incredibly strong.”

Trump is right to worry about how an economic slowdown could affect his presidency. Bill Clinton aide James Carville’s famous mantra during the 1992 presidential campaign was: “It’s the economy, stupid.” And the nation’s financial health is often key to a president’s re-election chances.

The last two presidents who failed to be re-elected, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, were primarily done in by faltering economies, said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley.

“It’s hard to convince the public to give you another chance if the economy is not doing well,” said Brinkley, a professor at Rice University. He suggested that even voters who do not like Trump’s personal behavior “tolerate him because they think he is good for Wall Street and jobs. If there is an economic downturn, that is going to take a devastating effect on him.”"

The attention on Obama comes as the ex-president steps back into the political arena on behalf of Democrats in the November elections. The White House dispatched economic adviser Kevin Hassett to rebut Obama’s point that his policies helped end the Great Recession and put the economy on a growth path that Trump is now mostly benefiting from.

The chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett addressed the nation’s economy in Tuesday’s briefing. Video by PBS NewsHour.

Companies are much more optimistic and have increased spending on buildings and equipment, Hassett said. Americans are starting new businesses and the increase in startups is accelerating more quickly than it did under Obama, he added, and blue-collar jobs — in mining, construction and manufacturing — are growing more rapidly.

Yet some of the White House’s case is wrong, exaggerated or lacks context:

GDP AND UNEMPLOYMENT

TRUMP: “The GDP rate (4.2 percent) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9 percent) for the first time in over 100 years!” — tweet Monday.

The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2018

HASSETT: “The correct number is 10 years.”

THE FACTS: Actually, the correct number is 12 years. In the first three months of 2006, the economy expanded at a 5.4 percent annual rate. At the same time, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent.

The economy’s growth rate, which reached 4.2 percent in the April-June quarter, has been higher than the unemployment rate dozens of times since World War II. Hassett acknowledged Trump’s tweet was wrong.

ECONOMIC UPTICK

HASSETT: “There was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump, and … a whole bunch of data items started heading north.”

THE FACTS: If you look at a chart of monthly job gains or the economy’s growth rate, that inflection point is hard to spot. Hassett notably did not include in his presentation any mention of overall job creation or the broadest measurement of the economy’s output, GDP.

That’s probably because the growth rate Trump repeatedly cites, the 4.2 percent expansion at an annual rate that occurred in the April-June quarter, isn’t out of line with Obama’s record. The economy grew more quickly than that four times during Obama’s eight years in office.

Economists generally acknowledge that growth has accelerated this year compared with 2016 and 2017, and most of them partly credit last year’s tax cuts for fueling more consumer and business spending. The economy is on pace to grow at a 3 percent or faster pace in 2018, which would be the first time since 2005 it would reach that mark.

Yet it barely missed that cutoff in 2015, when it expanded 2.9 percent under Obama.

When it comes to jobs, the U.S. added more jobs in each of the last three years of Obama’s presidency, 2014-2016, than it did last year, Trump’s first in office. Job growth has picked up a bit this year but is still on track to come in below the 2014-2015 pace.

SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM

HASSETT: “Small-business optimism is near the highest level in 35 years.”

THE FACTS: This is true. Small-business owners, as a whole, became far more optimistic about the economy after Trump’s election.

Many small-business people felt Obama was dismissive toward their efforts, particularly after his “You didn’t build that” comment in July 2012. Obama’s larger point was that governments helped create success by building roads, bridges, and the foundations for the internet. But his opponent at that time, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, seized on the comment as evidence that Obama didn’t appreciate small business.

Still, optimism doesn’t automatically translate into more spending or jobs. Small-business hiring has slowed in the past year as the unemployment rate has fallen to nearly an 18-year low. Larger firms are better able to attract workers in a tight labor market because they typically can offer higher pay and more benefits.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

HASSETT: “And I think that if anyone were to assert that the capital spending boom that we’re seeing right now was a continuation of the trend that President Trump inherited, then, well, they wouldn’t get a high grade in graduate school for that assertion.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that companies are investing much more in buildings, computers and other capital goods than they were in the last two years of the Obama administration. And some of that additional investment may have been spurred by the Trump administration’s corporate tax cut.

But another reason for the revitalization of business spending has been a turnaround in oil prices. Oil prices plunged in 2014 and 2015 from over $100 a barrel to roughly $30 a barrel in early 2016. They have since doubled to $67 a barrel. Those swings alternatively dampened investment in drilling rigs and other heavy machinery and helped send that spending higher.

Oil- and gas-related investment accounted for about 40 percent of the growth in business investment in the April-June quarter this year."

Johnson, America’s first black billionaire, said during a CNBC appearance on Friday that black Americans should be encouraged by the growing economy under President Trump. “Something is going right,” said Johnson, owner and chairman of Bethesda-based asset management firm RLJ Companies.

He cited the December jobs report showing that unemployment among black workers was at its lowest since the Labor Department began tracking the data in 1972.

Black unemployment did fall to 6.8 percent in December, before rising and dipping again to 6.9 percent in March, according to the latest jobs numbers released Friday. But black unemployment remains nearly double the white unemployment rate of 3.6 percent, even though the gap has narrowed somewhat.

Johnson, during his appearance on “Squawk Box” on Friday morning before the March jobs report was released, was optimistic about how black Americans will continue to fare economically.

""You have to take encouragement from what's happening in the labor force and the job market,"" Johnson said. ""When you look at African American unemployment, in over 50 years since the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping the numbers, you've never had two things: African American unemployment this low and the spread between unemployment among whites and African Americans narrowing.

“That absolutely means the jobs market is soliciting employees who have been out of the labor force, some of it just based on discrimination, some of it based on changes in education, access and technology changes,” he continued. “And so when you look at that, you have to say something is going right.”

Johnson praised the current U.S. business environment, “if you take into account the Trump tax cut,” he said. “I believe the economy is on a strong growth path.”

The December tax cuts were the largest one-time reduction in the corporate tax rate in U.S. history. The GOP bill, sold on the promise that it would drive up wages and increase job growth, also lowered taxes for the vast majority of Americans, as well as small-business owners.

While Trump often claims credit for the lower black unemployment rate — touting it in his State of the Union address in January and even tweeting a CNBC story about Johnson’s comments Friday — the brightening economic outlook preceded his presidency. The black unemployment rate had steadily declined during Barack Obama’s two terms, from nearly 17 percent in 2010, after the recession, down to 7.8 percent by the time Trump entered office in January 2017.

“Most of the programmatic work was set into motion before the last administration was leaving,” said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau.

Some economists criticized Johnson’s rosy assessment of the economic picture for black Americans.

“A 6.9 percent unemployment is perhaps in a historical sense something to be happy about, but if the white unemployment rate were at 6.9 percent, we would consider this catastrophic and be very alarmed,” said Darrick Hamilton, an economics and urban policy professor at The New School.

Hamilton noted that the structural nature of work has changed drastically since the government began tracking employment statistics, with very different implications today in regard to job security, wages and retirement benefits.

“Work is more precarious today than it was in the past, and in particular, black individuals are more likely to be in precarious employment scenarios with jobs that face greater wage and work-hour volatility,” Hamilton said. “Bob Johnson’s in the billionaire’s club with Donald Trump, so it’s not surprising that they align in their vision on labor.”

Johnson, who’s been friendly with Trump through the years, said he had met with Trump at his golf club in New Jersey shortly after his win when the president-elect offered Johnson a cabinet position.

“I thought I would meet to see if there’s common ground with someone most in the black community might call an enemy,” Johnson told NBC at the time. “It was clearly based on the respect two businessmen would give each other.”

Johnson reiterated Friday that he turned down the cabinet position because he didn’t want to work for the government. He said he continues to have access to top administration officials -- including Trump himself during a meeting last week in Florida -- who he speaks with regularly about improving the economic lives of African Americans. Among the issues he said he's engaged them on are encouraging black workers to save for retirement and keeping black-owned banks solvent so poor communities would have access to capital.

Johnson, a Democrat and supporter of Hillary Clinton, had previously penned an essay on how African American voters should respond to the “tectonic political rift” resulting in Trump’s election.

“Why shouldn't we, as Black voters, reject the notion that we are locked into one party which undoubtedly limits and dilutes our voting power? We should, instead, use the power of our vote to support and elect whichever party that best serves our interests,” Johnson wrote.

He went on to quote former representative William Lacy Clay Sr. (D-Mo.), who formed the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971: ""Black people have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests."""

To those who think that President Trump’s economic policy is simply an extended program to make the rich richer, there is another, more subtle possibility. The focus on the rich, while understandable, simplifies and misrepresents Trump’s larger ambition. This is to create an economy that is operating at the outer edges of its productive capacity — one that is exhausting its supply of workers and surplus of goods and services.

It is in this sense that the economy is “hot”; the comparable term in the 1960s and 1970s was the “high- ­pressure” economy. The theory is that only such an economy can force businesses to raise wages and hire marginal employees. Trump is shaping economic policy to realize this vision and, in the process, reap the political rewards of doing so.

There is only one large snag: We tried this in the ’60s and ’70s, and it failed abysmally. It led to double- ­digit inflation, frequent recessions and public demoralization. No matter. Trump is moving toward this sort of inflationary system by raising the economy’s demand and constricting its supply.

Here’s Trump’s check list.

First, pass a large tax cut financed by more borrowing. Check. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over a decade and be financed by larger deficits.

Second, increase government spending without, of course, offsetting extra demand with higher taxes (see above). Check. The recent budget plan is estimated to raise federal outlays by another $1.5 trillion over a decade.

Third, reduce government regulations, making it easier to begin new investment and construction projects. Check. This, too, would raise demand, though estimating how much is hard.

Fourth, limit competition from foreign workers and businesses by restricting immigration and imports. Check. From the border wall to rescinding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the administration has been anti-immigrant. Likewise, it has been protectionist; last week Trump announced new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

These various policies are familiar. What’s less familiar is their collective impact, which (again) is to stimulate demand and shrink supply.

Tight labor markets might well raise wage increases, and these in turn might stimulate higher price increases — and we are then off on a wage-price spiral reminiscent of the ’60s and ’70s. This, of course, won’t be the end of it.

Share this article Share

The prospect of higher inflation means that “the Fed and the [Trump] administration are on a collision course,” as my colleague Sebastian Mallaby recently wrote in The Post. The Fed could respond to heightened inflation fears by raising interest rates more than is now expected. Or it could leave current plans unchanged on the hope that inflation won’t worsen. Either way, the economy and stock market could be vulnerable to a significant setback.

Running the economy “hot” is a superficially attractive policy. It promises to deliver the benefits of a strong economy to those who most need them. It suggests that we can enjoy the advantages of “full employment” on a more or less permanent basis. But like many appealing and visionary ideas, its utility breaks down in practice. It may make matters worse.

Traditionally, these policies have been most popular among the liberal left, because less-skilled workers seem to benefit the most. But, inevitably, there’s a backlash against higher inflation that — entailing higher interest rates and, often, recessions — hurts these very same workers. Though the process may be drawn out, it still takes its toll. Trump is either unaware of or indifferent to the contradictions.

At considerable social cost — fluctuating prices, widespread fears of the future — we learned these lessons in the 1970s. Surely we don’t have to learn them again.

Moore helps to explain what exactly GDP is and the phenomenon of the Trump economy.





Tim Doescher: President Trump made some pretty bold campaign statements. But one of them receive particularly high criticism from the left and high praise from the right. That regards GDP growth.

“That's why I believe it's time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. And my great economists don't want me to say this, but I think we can do better than that.” President Donald Trump

Doescher: GDP or Growth Domestic Product is defined as the market value of all final goods and services produced within the country in a given period. It measures businesses, households, government spending, exports, while subtracting are imports or foreign products. While not perfect, it seems a reliable guide as to the general health of the economy. But one thing is safe to say, the higher growth, the better Americans are. Last Friday, when the Commerce Department announced that GDP grew by 4.1%, the White House took a victory lap, because many thought this number was almost impossible to reach. Now, many on the right are using this to push for more pro-growth policies like tax reform, and regulation reduction.

Doescher: So, let's break this down. What does GDP growth mean for the middle class? Is it helping? Or like many on the left say, is it just a favor to the wealthiest of Americans? To talk about the new GDP numbers and the state of our economy in general, I sat down with Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow in the project for economic growth here at The Heritage Foundation. He also served as an economic advisor to Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and continues to unofficially advise the president on economic issues. Stephen Moore, thanks so much for joining us today.

Stephen Moore: Thanks, Tim.



Doescher: Give us a brief description of what GDP is and whether or not you think it's an important measure of how our economy is doing.



Moore: The GDP is just the measure of precisely that, how the economy is doing, it's a measure of our collective output, everything we produce in a month or a quarter, or in a year. That number is off the charts, growing. This is as we predicted, if Trump put in place deregulation, and lower taxes, and all-American Energy policies and pro-business policies, that you would see this kind of unleashing effect of these businesses really expanding their output. By the way, this is ... we give a lot of credit to Trump for his policies, but this is a real testament to the 28 million men and women who run American businesses, who are expanding, finding ways to make profits, and hire more workers. This is a great time to be in America, it's a great time to be an American worker. I'm one of those people who thinks this can last for another two, or three, or four years.

Doescher: Many people have ... they've already heard the second quarter growth number being 4.1%, that's up from 2% in the first quarter of 2018, and they hear these numbers, 2% and 4.1% and say, ""That's not that big of an increase."" If you could maybe break it down and tell us what does it actually mean to go from a 2% increase to a 4.1% increase. Maybe you can put that in context for non-economists.



Moore: Let's see, we have a $20 trillion economy, so every percentage point increase in growth means something like $200 billion of additional output, that's the whole output of Michigan and Ohio combined. These are giant numbers. The economy under Obama was growing at a little less than 2% over his eight years in office. Under Trump, we're at 3% to 3.5% growth now, or in his term. That's a big increase, it means the economy is growing almost twice as fast under Trump as it did under Obama. One of the reasons higher economic growth is so important is if you can raise the economic growth rate to say 3% from 2%. That additional one percentage point may not seem like a big deal, but over a decade, that leads to about $3 trillion more federal and state and local tax revenues, because people if they're working, if businesses are profitable, they pay more taxes.



Moore: If people are shopping for things, you get more sales tax revenues. The growth is the best way to bring down our debt and deficit, and we're going to start to see that under Trump. I like to look at jobs, I like to look at wages, because this, as you said, Tim, how does this affect the average American? They can see this in the openings for jobs in businesses, we now have 5 to 6 million more job openings than we have people can fill them. That's kind of a nice problem for economy to have, unless you're the businessman or woman who's trying to find those workers. We're starting to see wages rise, and that was the intention of the tax cut, by the way, wasn't to help rich people.

Moore: I mean, I love rich people, we all want to get rich, we want more rich people. But the intention was really to create a labor market to get more businesses investing as a way to lift wages, because for 20 years, wages have not really budged up for middle class workers. We're starting to see those rise a little bit. I think as the labor market gets tighter, business are going to have to start offering workers more pay, and incidentally, you see this in wages, and bonuses. If you see the official statistics that are looking at wages, the big [inaudible 00:06:39] all wages aren't rising. They're raising a little bit. But one of the things that that doesn't take into account is bonuses.

Moore: There are 6 million workers who've gotten bonuses everywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 to $4,000. That's a big increase for somebody who's making $40,000 a year to give them a $2,000 bonus. I think the condition of the American worker today is very strong, and boy has it changed over where it was two, three, four, five years ago.

Doescher: Stephen, last year you wrote that if we really want to see a healthy economy, we need real and sustained growth of 3% to 4%. You agreed with Trump that with the right policy we can reach these numbers. But many economists on the left, including Paul Krugman, Larry Summers, and Austan Goolsbee don't.

Moore: Why does anybody really listen to Paul Krugman, or Larry Summers, or the faculty of Economics at Harvard or Yale? They completely misread the economy. They said if Trump is elected, we're going to get a second Great Depression. Now we got the strongest economy in 25 years. They couldn't have been more wrong. It's like getting in a plane and you're flying to California and you end up in Kazakhstan. That's how wrong they were.

Doescher: Big mistake.

They said if Trump is elected, we're going to get a second Great Depression. Now we got the strongest economy in 25 years. They couldn't have been more wrong. It's like getting in a plane and you're flying to California and you end up in Kazakhstan. - Stephen Moore

Moore: Yeah, and a big mistake. I think those people should show a little humility and just say, ""You know what? We were wrong."" By the way, I'm not always right, you know me for a long time, Tim. I make mistakes, I made wrong predictions. I remember when Clinton was president, I said, ""This isn't going to work."" We had very strong growth, and I said, ""You know what? These policies are working pretty well."" So yeah, we can do this. Now the argument that is made, even by some of our friends, is like the economy is running out of steam, that it's a long recovery and it has been, I think it's one of the longest recoveries we've had.



Doescher: Since 2008, you're saying the recovery …



Moore: Yeah, exactly. That's right. This is now a nine year recovery. That's a long recovery without a recession. People say, ""Well, a recession has to be right around the corner."" The reason I don't believe that's true is because, yeah we had a recovery under Obama, but you and I wrote these papers, it was the weakest recovery we ever had for a lot of Americans and places like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Kentucky, there was no recovery.



Doescher: Let's talk about different measures of the economy. Is GDP the entire picture? I know you talked briefly about the labor market, things like that, can we still have a healthy economy if we don't sustain a 4.1% growth rate? Can we do that? Can we settle for 3%? Can we settle for 2.5%? Where would you be comfortable? Where would you be happy?



Moore: I'm going to sound like Donald Trump and say I want 5%. Let's aim high. There's no reason ... we laugh at that, and yet, when John F. Kennedy was president, he cut taxes, we had 6% growth for three or four years. When Reagan cut taxes, and deregulate the economy, we had quarters of 8% growth, 8%. We're talking about 4% growth being a great number, can you imagine 8.3%? There's no law of economics, or law of physics, that says the economy can't grow faster. If you have more business investment, if you have more people working, if you have more invention and entrepreneurship, you get more growth. One of the things that's happening now is we're sucking capital in from the rest of the world.



Moore: I always say, in a global economy, whatever country gets the most capital wins. We're doing that now, because we have a very pro-business environment here, and so yes, this is sustainable. I would like to see growth up in the 3% to 4% range for a long time. Now, one thing I will say that is very flawed with the GDP numbers that we've talked a lot about at Heritage is guess what is one big component of GDP?

Doescher: Government spending.



Moore: Government, yeah. Government is a negative for the economy, not a positive. We should probably subtract government from GDP. If you got a big boost of government, and unfortunately, unfortunately in the first and second quarter of this year, government grew. That was this illusion that economy is growing, but as my colleagues here say at Heritage, every dollar the government spends is the dollar that's subtracted from private sector. The government doesn't create anything. That is something that's a little bit concerning, is the government's growing too fast. Incidentally, state, local government grew too. Why is that happening? Because the economy is booming, state and local governments are getting more receipts, and what do you think they're doing with that money? They're spending it.



Doescher: Let's talk a little more about what this growth means for [inaudible 00:11:56] America. Heritage recently released numbers that say, ""A family of four will save nearly $3,000 per year, or almost $45,000 over the next 10 years because of the GOP tax cut."" How are policies like tax cuts and regulation reduction playing a role here?



Moore: Tim, I mean, those numbers you're talking about are just crumbs. Come on. Joking folks, that's Nancy Pelosi. (laughing)



Doescher: I believe you're referencing Nancy Pelosi.(laughing)



Moore: Those are very significant numbers for a family that makes $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year. [inaudible 00:12:28] $2,000 or $3,000 in income. I've literally met people on the street who come up to me and they'll say, ""Gee, I know you worked with Trump on this tax plan, and I just got a $1,500 bonus from my employer."" These are people who, you know, lower, middle class people, who are doing service jobs and so on. That's a big deal. If you're like Nancy Pelosi, and you've got 12 acres and you've got a swimming pool and a mansion, that doesn't add up to much, but for working class people, that's a lot of money.



Moore: This is the idea of creating a rising tide that lifts all boats. As we speak, I'm looking at a New York Times headline that says, ""The US Treasury is weighing up $100 billion tax cut for rich people."" That's ridiculous. We're talking about a reduction in the capital gains tax that will, indexing it for inflation, that will add to the capital stock in America, more business investment, it'll allow people to sell the assets they have now and redeploy in new businesses, and new startups, and new technology companies. How is that bad for America? How is that a tax cut for rich people? That's a tax cut for working class people and incidentally 100 million Americans own stock. How is this just for rich people?



Doescher: Okay. One last question. In all your experiences with Trump since you began working with him on the campaign until now, what is your most memorable story?

Moore: I was out at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach with ... the president was there. This was a month or two ago. I had the occasion to just chat with the president for three or four minutes. I came up to him, and kind of tapped him on the shoulder, because I came up from behind and, ""Hey, Stephen, isn't this tax cut the most unbelievable thing?"" He's a very cheerful guy. I just said, ""Mr. President, this stuff is working even better we thought it would."" I just said to him, I knew it was going to help growth, but I didn't think we'd get to 4% so quickly. He just turned to me with a big smile, he said, ""Stephen, you ain't seen nothing yet."" How's that for a happy ending?



Doescher: That's awesome, Stephen. Thank you so much for joining us.

Moore: Thanks, Tim."

And President Trump, as has become his habit, wasted little time in tweeting boastfully about the new data.

But this has become an exercise in cherry-picking and selective memory. It’s worth taking a step back to evaluate how we got here and who did the heavy lifting. In fact, it was President Obama who inherited an economy in catastrophic freefall, whose stewardship pulled the auto industry back from the brink and ushered the nation out of the Great Recession. Job growth in the last 20 months of the Obama administration was actually better than in the first 20 months of the Trump administration.

But we need to ask a bigger question: What’s the measure of a strong economy?

Is it simply the number of jobs created or a certain level of GDP growth? These are certainly important–low unemployment is obviously better than high unemployment. But is that enough? To whom are the benefits of economic growth flowing? Are these new jobs family-sustaining?

There is plenty of evidence that this is a strong economy primarily for those already in a privileged position. As a recent Washington Post headline put it: “America is richer than ever, but most Americans aren’t.”"

The unemployment rate fell slightly to 3.8 percent. The numbers were eclipsed earlier Friday morning by a presidential tweet that breaks a federal rule.

Wage growth remained a sticking point in the mainly positive jobs report, with hourly pay up by only 2.7 percent year on year. But with inflation at just over 2 percent, workers are barely feeling any net increase. The current wage growth rate is almost half what would be expected with an unemployment rate this low.

The Federal Reserve, which next meets on June 12-13, has been confounded by the lack of wage growth and will be closely watching the May number in order to weigh options for inflationary measures. The Fed noted this week that ""wage increases remained modest in most Districts,” but it still likely to approve an increase in its benchmark interest rate at the June meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee.

“One of the ways wages move up in aggregate is people change jobs,” Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura, told CNBC. ""Labor market turnover is low — the turnover matters.”

President Donald Trump, who likely saw the monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last night, gave an early hint of the positive numbers in a tweet Friday morning ahead of the official announcement.

Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2018

It is not customary for a president to make mention of the crucial figures in advance, as such action could send signals to the market.

With such low unemployment, one might expect the pace of hiring to dampen as the workforce grows and all available jobs get filled — but May’s figures are a firm indication that the economy remains locked in a record growth streak, with companies clearly still adding jobs for the 92nd straight month.

Here are 5 takeaways from that report

President Donald Trump said he doesn't ""believe"" a major report that includes the economic impact of climate change on the U.S. made public by his administration on Friday – a holiday week release.

Trump on Monday said that he's read some of the report and that ""it's fine,"" but he doesn't believe some of the analysis that predicts possible devastating effects on the economy.

Here are five things to know about the National Climate Assessment released last week.

What is the report?

The report released Friday is part of a series of reports published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program to analyze research on the impacts of climate change on the U.S., which Congress established in 1990. The research program consults with hundreds of subject matter experts from 13 federal agencies, state and local governments, and academic researchers. The experts look at the available research and models to write the comprehensive report and evaluate how confident they are in the findings.

The first volume of the report, the Climate Science Special Report released last year, was designed as an ""authoritative assessment of the science of climate change"" to inform policymakers and the public as they decide how to respond to climate change, according to the executive summary. The National Climate Assessment released last week looks more specifically at the impact of climate change in different parts of the U.S. and how local leaders are working to respond to those impacts.

The report concludes that ""the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.""

1:09

It also found that while Americans in some areas are working to limit the negative consequences of climate change none of the work being done ""currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades.""

The White House said in a statement the report is ""largely based on the most extreme scenario"" and doesn't account for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and new technologies that reduce pollution. Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters also said in a statement the White House wants more transparency in these reports.

The report went through an extensive process since 2016, including being posted for 60 days of public comment in January of this year and multiple rounds of review to incorporate comments from government agencies and other experts.

The version released publicly last week aims to make the information accessible to a broad audience but cites more than 6,000 unique references and consulted 300 different authors, according to the release.

Concerns the administration tried to bury it

Climate experts, researchers that worked on the report, activists, and Democratic lawmakers have raised concern that the Trump administration tried to bury the report by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving.

While the report still received widespread news coverage, critics say the timing combined with Trump's track record on casting doubt on climate science and the administration's push to reverse policies intended to combat climate change show the administration does not want to address the issue.

One of the editors of the report, World Resources Institute senior fellow Andrew Light, said the administration did not edit the findings of the report but they did decide when it would be released and the decision to publish it on Black Friday was irresponsible given the urgency of the subject matter.

""At the end of the day, this was simply not a responsible choice,"" Light told ABC News' Brad Mielke on the Start Here podcast.

In response to a recently released climate report from the United Nations, Trump said he does not think climate change is a ""hoax"" but he also cast doubt on some of the projections and even alluded that climate scientists are politically motivated.

Report found possibility for economic loss

The new National Climate Assessment builds on some findings from previous reports, such as the threat of flooding from sea level rise and more premature deaths attributed to extreme heat.

But the report also incorporated more information on the economic impacts of climate change and found that disruptive extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and the impacts of climate change in other countries could all damage the U.S. economy. For example, hotter temperatures could make power plants less efficient while demand for electricity goes up, resulting in higher costs for electricity.

Without more focus on adapting to climate change, the report found that as temperatures continue to rise it could lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses every year in damage to coastal properties, costs associated with heat-related deaths, and lost labor hours from extreme temperatures.

Climate impacts already being felt, but not equally

The impacts of climate change are already being felt in many communities, but they don't look the same in every community.

Climate change poses more risks to communities that are already vulnerable because they don't have the resources to prepare or adapt to harm from extreme weather, changes in temperature, or other disruptions to infrastructure and the economy.

But some parts of the country are more at risk than others.

In Alaska, for example, more infrastructure is being damaged when the layer of frozen ground called the permafrost thaws. Factors that kill trees and plants like longer droughts and higher temperatures are exacerbating wildfires in Alaska and other western states like California, where wildfires are especially costly.

Along the coasts, the report says climate change poses more of an economic risk since $1 trillion in national wealth is in coastal real estate. Rising sea levels, higher storm surges, and increases in flooding during high tide will threaten those properties and lead to more costs to preserve infrastructure on the coast, as well as potentially displace families that live there.

The report also references the possible impact of climate change on tourism from reduced snowpack, which affects areas in the western part of the country and the Northeast where tourist activities rely on natural snow and ice. In the Northeast especially the report says those activities ""may not be economically viable"" by the end of the century unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced. Outdoor recreation could also be impacted in areas where smoke from worsening wildfires cause poor air quality.

Will the report change anything?

The report intentionally does not recommend specific policies, but notes many observations for lawmakers to consider and highlights some examples of policies intended to limit the problems caused by climate change.

Most significantly the report says that even though natural gas and renewable energy have replaced fossil fuels in many areas, ""more immediate and substantial"" reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed to avoid the most severe, long-term consequences.

The Trump administration and Republican leadership in Congress have not signaled plans to take broad action on climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But high-ranking Democrats on committees that deal with federal environmental policy have said they plan intensive oversight of the Trump administration's decisions to roll back policies intended to combat climate change when the new legislative session starts in January.

Democrats will likely call for administration officials to defend the president's call to reduce regulations, roll back policies proposed by the Obama administration to aggressively combat climate change, and allow more energy production on federal land.

Congress is also expected to take up a spending bill that would allocate billions of dollars for infrastructure projects. The report says that aging infrastructure around the country is stressed extreme weather events and overall is not prepared for a changing climate.

National and local lawmakers could consider the findings of the report when deciding how much to spend on projects like repairing roads and bridges or updating water systems."

What caused this steep drop in the price of the lira? There are multiple factors, many of which are related to the economic policies of Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

But on Friday, there was another distinct element that made things worse: a tweet from President Trump.

I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2018

At 8.47 a.m. Eastern time — 3:47 p.m. in Turkey — Trump had turned to Twitter to announce that he would be doubling steel and aluminum sanctions on Turkey. The move came as Washington was in a diplomatic standoff with Ankara over Turkey’s detention of an evangelical pastor from North Carolina.

The detention of Andrew Brunson, who is facing trial on charges related to a failed 2016 coup in Turkey, has caused a major setback in relations between the two NATO allies. Last week, the United States implemented punitive sanctions on two members of the Turkish cabinet and warned of further measures to come.

This economic uncertainty had rattled Turkey’s already shaky economy, and the lira had dropped a number of times since the beginning of August.

On Friday, before Trump’s tweet, Erdogan had tried to stem the sell-off by appealing to Turkish citizens to exchange any dollars, euros or gold for lira to help the currency. “This is a national, domestic battle,” he told a crowd in the northeastern city of Bayburt, according to Reuters. ""This will be my people’s response to those who have waged an economic war against us.”

Erdogan’s words did little to reassure investors. The price of the lira dropped significantly immediately after he spoke.

Many analysts have dismissed Erdogan’s complaints about a foreign-led “economic war” against Turkey, suggesting they were largely a scapegoat for the failings of the Turkish leader’s own economic policies.

But Trump’s tweet Friday may change that. In his Twitter message, the U.S. president noted specifically how the Turkish lira was sliding “rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar.” He added: “Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!”

The Trump administration is no stranger to using its economic power as a political weapon to hit foreign powers. It has stepped up sanctions against countries such as North Korea, Iran and Russia, among others. In a number of countries, most notably Iran and Russia, this has caused the value of their currency to drop significantly.

At the same time, the United States is fighting an economic war against China through tariffs and other measures. Trump’s tweet Friday showed that in many cases, the political and economic factors overlap — Trump’s decision to double sanctions on Turkey was made possible by a key trade law called Section 232 that gives the U.S. president very broad powers over tariffs in cases of national security."

If the FactSet estimate is correct, that would be the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2014, when GDP rose 5.2 percent. The Trump administration has set at least 3 percent growth as a target, a number the U.S. economy has not hit since the Great Recession for a full calendar year.

CNBC's Rapid Update tracker of economic forecasts projects GDP to rise 4.2 percent in the quarter, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow is putting the number at 4.5 percent and the New York Fed's Nowcast is at a more subdued 2.7 percent.

The Trump tweet comes after Fox Business Network reported that the president has been telling associates that he sees the number around 4.8 percent.

Trump caused a stir in June when he tweeted about an hour before the monthly jobs report release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He said he was ""looking forward"" to the May report, which showed 223,000 new jobs, ahead of the 188,000. The number was later revised even higher, to 244,000.

Shortly after the economic tweet Tuesday, he sent another message that repeated his campaign slogan.

MAGA tweet

Trump's top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, said during last week's Delivering Alpha conference that the economy could grow ahead of 4 percent for ""a quarter or two"" before cooling off."

Politically, a lot rides on perceptions of economic performance. Incumbents are almost always reelected amid strong economies. They are frequently defeated amid weak ones.

If Trump really has unleashed “an economic miracle,” that’s a powerful argument for his reelection, and for the Republican Congress that supported him. If the good economic news is a mirage, or if Trump is just riding the Obama administration’s economic policy coattails, then his sole claim to success evaporates. So which is it?

Let’s begin with the data. In July, the economy clocked its 93rd uninterrupted month of job growth — the longest stretch in American history. For the first time on record, there are more open jobs than job seekers. The unemployment rate is 3.9 percent; the last time the unemployment rate was this low was in 2000, the tail end of the Clinton boom.

According to Gallup, 65 percent of Americans believe this is a good time to find a quality job, among the highest readings the pollster has recorded since they began asking the question in 2002.

The cheerful economic news is largely absent from worker paychecks, though. Average hourly wage growth has been 2.7 percent over the past year, anemic given the power and length of the economic expansion. Making matters worse, a surge of inflation, driven by higher oil prices, has clawed back almost all those wage gains, as David Leonhardt documents at the New York Times.

These trends didn’t begin with Trump’s election. This is what the unemployment rate has looked like since 2012. If you can detect a sharp break between the Obama and Trump economies, you’ve got a keener eye than I do:

Looking at job growth yields a similar picture. Depending on which period you’re talking about, you can argue that job growth since Trump was elected has been a bit slower or a bit faster than in the years preceding him, but it’s all clearly within the same trend.

“If you take a look at President Obama’s second term, he was adding 217,000 jobs,” says Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan who served as chief economist at the Labor Department under Barack Obama. “And since Trump assumed the presidency, he’s been adding 189,000 jobs per month. I’d say those are roughly around the same ballpark. But I don’t think Trump should be bragging that he’s somehow doing something that President Obama wasn’t doing.”

The same is true for GDP growth. “Not too long ago, progressive economists said strong economic growth couldn’t be done anymore— that a stagnant U.S. economy was the ‘new normal,’” tweeted House Speaker Paul Ryan. “And yet, our economy is growing at its fastest rate since 2014.”

There is something odd about suggesting you’ve owned the libs and defied the odds by returning to a growth rate last seen during Obama’s second term. At any rate, the Bureau of Economic Analysis offers this chart, which again makes a strong case that we’re basically seeing an economy similar to that of Obama’s second term.

It’s hard to look at this data and argue that the Trump economy represents a sharp break with the Obama economy.

But that argument cuts both directions. Trump hasn’t unleashed an economic miracle, but he hasn’t caused a crisis either. Plenty of liberals believed a Trump victory would be devastating for the economy, tanking stock markets amid fears of trade wars, nuclear wars, and political chaos. That Trump has managed to keep growth going might be a less impressive record than he claims, but it’s a more impressive record than many of his critics expected.

“I’ll give the president credit for not steering the economy into a ditch,” says Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the University of Minnesota who closely tracks economic trends. “That’s the main accomplishment. He inherited a strong economy, strong trends, after a campaign of telling us the economy was terrible and awful and we had to make America great again. And now he’s declared victory.”

How Republicans stopped worrying and remembered they love deficits

To the extent that we’ve seen a modest growth bump over the past year, the driving reason might be one Republicans are loath to admit: After years of refusing the Obama administration’s entreaties to lift sequestration and cut taxes for workers, congressional Republicans have joined Trump to boost government spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and pass $1.5 trillion in unpaid tax cuts.

There’s been, in other words, a large, deficit-financed demand-side stimulus of the sort Republicans condemned when Obama asked for it but were all too happy to pass as soon as Trump took office. And after years in which Republicans warned that fear of long-term debt was stopping corporations from investing and the economy from growing, they’ve added trillions to the national credit card without any evident harm to the economy.

“Trump took the Obama economy and added a Keynesian spending boost Republicans never would’ve let Obama do,” says Sojourner.

The disappointment is that more of this money hasn’t shown up in wages. The good news, to the extent that there is good news, is that recent pay raises have been concentrated at the bottom end of the income distribution. Workers in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution are seeing faster real wage growth than they have since the late 1990s, but wages overall are growing more slowly than would be expected for an economy that’s grown this much for this long.

Different economists have different explanations for what’s come to be called “the wage puzzle”; my colleague Matt Yglesias has a great piece on this. But the fact remains that a strong economy hasn’t led to proportionately bigger paychecks. This likely explains why the Trump administration’s tax cuts remain resolutely unpopular: The public heard about trillions of dollars coming down the pike, but they seem to be getting precious little of it.

“What we did was we gave a bunch of money back to people through tax cuts and we didn’t [pay for it],” says Stevenson. “Of course that’s going to provide some sort of short-term stimulus. Now the question is whether that encourages further investment in the economy that creates long-term growth.”

So is this a strong economy? Yes, with some big caveats. Does Trump deserve much of the credit? That’s a harder case to make, but it’s clear that he hasn’t derailed what growth we’ve had, which is an accomplishment of a sort.

The question, now, is whether growth continues. A recession would be devastating, as wage increases haven’t come near to making up for the pain caused by the last recession, and Republicans have taken fiscal firepower that could’ve been held in reserve for a future downturn and spent it on tax cuts and military boosts amid an expansion. It’s a risky strategy for the economy long-term, but it’s one that may boost the GOP’s chances in the next few elections."

The Trump administration has strengthened U.S. relations with Riyadh, touting a $110 billion package of proposed weapons sales as a key economic achievement, but reports the Saudi government plotted the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Turkey has added pressure.

In a Wednesday night interview on Fox News, Trump said he would want to know what happened before committing to a response and expressed reluctance to halt arms sales to Riyadh, citing economic concerns.

“Well, I think that would be hurting us. We have jobs. We have a lot of things happening in this country. We have a country that's doing probably better economically than it's ever done before,” Trump said.

“Part of that is what we are doing with our defense systems, and everybody is wanting them, and frankly I think that would be a very, very tough pill to swallow for our country. I mean, you’re affecting us.”

RELATED

On Trump’s first trip abroad as president, he visited Saudi Arabia and announced the massive arms sales package. U.S. ties have long been anchored by energy interests, counterterror cooperation and more recently U.S.-Saudi military cooperation in the Yemen civil war.

Since 2009, the executive branch has notified Congress of proposed foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia of major defense articles and services with a potential aggregate value of nearly $139 billion, according to a Congressional Research Service report. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia concluded arms sale agreements worth more than $65 billion, from fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2016.

Earlier Wednesday, Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and reviewed U.S. intelligence on the case, said it was likely that Khashoggi was killed the day he walked into the consulate. Whatever took place, Corker said, “there was Saudi involvement” and “everything points to them.”

More than 20 Republicans and Democratic senators on Wednesday instructed Trump to order a probe into Khashoggi’s disappearance under legislation that authorizes imposition of sanctions for perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, torture or other gross human rights violations.

Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy on Thursday called for the administration to cease military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, citing reports that Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Murphy is part of a growing call in Congress to check U.S. support — which includes aerial refueling and arms sales — amid reports Saudi airstrikes have killed civilians.

“The United States cannot be in a military partnership with a country that has this little concern for human life,” said Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “The Saudis continue to claim that they aren’t targeting civilians inside Yemen, but how can we believe them when they apparently just hunted down and murdered an American resident whose only offense was writing critical articles about the Saudi royal family? This is the right time to suspend our military support for the disastrous bombing campaign in Yemen.”

RELATED

Earlier in the week, Sen. Rand Paul, another member of the committee, called for a halt on U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia until Khashoggi is found alive.

“To me, this is just one more reason why we should be very suspect about selling arms to the Saudis,” Paul, R-Ky., said in a Fox News interview. “If they have the ability and also the audacity to go into another country and kill a journalist, these aren’t the kind of people maybe that we want to be selling arms to.”

Paul also cited Saudi Arabia’s intervention in neighboring Yemen’s civil war.

“What you do have evidence of is that the Saudis have been bombing civilians in Yemen for over a year now,” he said. “I think [there’s] growing opposition to what the Saudis are doing in Yemen, and this just adds to it.”

Trump's tumultuous first year was unlike that of any other president in recent U.S. history, and 2018 could offer more of the same. The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric.

WATCH: Trump's First Year: Strong Economy but Weak Polls

Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East.

""We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,"" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. ""But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.""

The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. ""We are very proud of it,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. ""It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.""

Bump for tax bill

In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy.

The tax victory also seems to be helping Trump galvanize the Republican Party behind him, even those who in the past have been cool to his leadership.

""This president hasn't even been in office for a year, and look at all the things he has been able to get done, by sheer will in many ways,"" said Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who also announced recently he would not run for re-election this year.

Passage of the tax bill could help Republicans in this year's congressional elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains, especially in the House of Representatives.

""The Republicans did get a tax bill passed, a significant tax bill in December, and that was a major accomplishment for them, so that is something that has put them on a better track,"" said John Fortier of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington research group.

Obamacare, heated rhetoric

But there were plenty of setbacks in Trump's first year as well, including a failed attempt to repeal Obamacare, numerous outbursts on Twitter and at times inflammatory presidential rhetoric, including Trump's recent reported vulgar description of Haiti and African countries in terms of immigration.

That prompted outrage from several Democrats, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a possible presidential contender in 2020. ""Those words don't dissipate like mist in the air. They fester, they become poison, and they give license to bigotry and hate in our country,"" Booker said at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Booker sharply questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who said she could not recall Trump's reported reference to s---hole countries.

Analysts contend that Trump's controversial and at times polarizing leadership style continues to hurt his poll ratings despite a strong economy that should give him more of a boost. ""I think people are judging him on a variety of other factors other than the economy, and that explains his lower approval rating,"" said Brookings Institution scholar John Hudak.

Beware midterm mayhem

The Gallup Poll found that Trump had an average approval rating of 39 percent during his first year in office, a historic low. Former President Bill Clinton ended his first year in office at 49 percent, an approval rating that contributed to Democrats' losing control of the House in 1994.

Trump's low approval rating also could fuel Democratic gains in the November congressional elections, said University of Virginia analyst Larry Sabato. ""When there is a wave, the water does not distinguish between those who identified with an unpopular president and those who tried to put distance between themselves and that unpopular president,"" Sabato said via Skype.

For 2018, Trump hopes a strong economy will improve his poll numbers. But the prospect of election losses in November and a Russia probe with no end in sight could make Trump's second year in office even more challenging than his first."

Shop owners had increased their prices twenty per cent over the past two weeks. The cost of a package of eggs had risen by fifty per cent in a week; the price of bananas imported from Latin America had doubled. Aynur Keskin, a homemaker with two school-aged children, bought a few items and shook her head, dismayed at the rising inflation, a result of the country’s ailing economy and the plummeting Turkish lira. “I was thinking of going abroad for a holiday, but that’s a dream now,” she told me.

Mesut Taşkıran, the owner of a Kadıköy grocery store, told me he has started hoarding money and limiting his personal spending. “If things continue to go higher, we might have to shut down,” he said, referring to his shop.

For years the Turkish economy has been on a downward spiral, due to burgeoning international debt and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s policy of keeping interest rates artificially low. In the last several weeks, a dispute between Erdoğan and President Donald Trump has accelerated a drop in the value of the Turkish lira, which fell to a record low on Monday of 7.24 to the dollar. (A year ago, a dollar could buy three and a half lira; two years ago, three.) By the end of the day Wednesday the value had rebounded slightly, but investors, business leaders, and Turkish government officials still feared that the economy might crash.

In the past decade, Turkey’s growing economy attracted a flood of foreign investment. But recent diplomatic rifts between Turkey and the West, declining tourism, and Erdoğan’s authoritarian consolidation of power—which was cemented in June elections that granted him sultan-like powers—caused many investors to pull out and sell off their Turkish debt, slowing the economy’s pace and accelerating inflation. Debt in foreign currencies, most of it in dollars, now represents around seventy per cent of the Turkish economy. American investors now own more than fifty per cent of publicly traded Turkish stocks, according to the Institute of International Finance. “The government’s policies have caused the problems,” Yüksel Gönül, an employee at a dairy store, told me. “But we are the victims.”

Erdoğan and Trump have been exchanging public taunts—and economic sanctions—over Turkey’s two-year imprisonment of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical American missionary accused of espionage, links to terrorist groups, and involvement in the failed Turkish coup in 2016. Brunson, who faces up to thirty-five years in prison, has denied the charges.

On July 25th, Turkey moved Brunson to house arrest, a concession that Trump deemed inadequate. The following day, in a tweet, Trump announced that “The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson, a great Christian, family man and wonderful human being.” A week later, he implemented sanctions against Turkey’s justice and interior ministers, freezing their U.S. assets and barring them from doing business with American citizens. Turkey responded by sanctioning the officials’ American counterparts, before Trump announced, on Friday, in another tweet, that the U.S. would be doubling its tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum.

Turkish analysts told me that Trump’s tweets enraged Erdoğan and his aides, and even offended Turkey’s opposition parties, most of which bitterly opposed Erdoğan in the June election, to the extent that they sided with the government against Trump. Erdoğan, in a defiant speech addressing an assembly of foreign ambassadors, said, “The bullies of the global system cannot roughly, shamelessly encroach on our gains that were paid for by blood.” On Tuesday, Erdoğan announced boycotts of U.S.-made electronics, and urged Turkey’s eighty million citizens to stop buying iPhones in particular, calling Trump’s sanctions against Turkey an “explicit economic attack.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, during a concurrent visit to Turkey, accused the Trump Administration of using “sanctions, threats, blackmail, and diktat” against Turkey, Russia, and Iran. In an Op-Ed published in the Times on Friday, Erdoğan wrote that “Washington must give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical and come to terms with the fact that Turkey has alternatives,” perhaps hinting at an alliance with Russia. “Failure to reverse this trend of unilateralism and disrespect will require us to start looking for new friends and allies.”

Elmira Bayrasli, a professor of international affairs at Bard College, told me that both Presidents were trying appear strong to their core supporters at home. “What you’re seeing right now is Donald Trump using any opportunity to show his leadership ability and his sense of power. Erdoğan’s doing the same thing that Donald Trump is doing—scoring cheap political points,” Bayrasli told me. “Erdoğan’s a shrewd politician. He has a pulse on the Middle East, and the mood is people are tired of being pushed around by the West, especially [amid] the growing anti-Islamism since 9/11.” Matthew Bryza, a former American diplomat and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, who now lives in Turkey, said that, following the NATO summit in Brussels, in early July, Trump and Erdoğan “were very close to an agreement.” But, after Erdoğan placed Brunson under house arrest instead of releasing him, “the U.S. side lost patience.”

Brunson has lived in Turkey for more than two decades, doing missionary work and running an evangelical church in the coastal city of Izmir. He was detained on charges of being linked to both Fethullah Gülen, an elderly Islamist cleric, living in exile in Pennsylvania, whom the Turkish government accuses of masterminding the failed coup, and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., a separatist group that has battled Turkish forces in the country’s southeast for nearly thirty-five years. Erdoğan has repeatedly demanded that Gülen be extradited to Turkey, but the Obama and Trump Administrations, in concert with the Justice Department, have said that Turkey’s evidence against him is insufficient.

In Brunson’s indictment, two unidentified witnesses, code-named “Fire” and “Prayer,” claim that Brunson was proselytizing Christianity to members of the P.K.K., so that they could receive asylum in the West. He was found to be in contact with members of the Gülen network, and expressed displeasure, in a text message to a friend in Canada, that the coup had failed. Brunson was also accused of holding regular meetings with members of the American military at Incirlik Air Base, in southern Turkey. In a court appearance, on April 16th, Brunson claimed innocence, saying that he simply wants to “do Jesus’s work.” “I’ve never done something against Turkey. I love Turkey. I’ve been praying for Turkey for twenty-five years,” he said. “I want truth to come out.”

Turkish officials have expressed surprised at how important Brunson is to the Trump Administration, considering that several other Americans, including the NASA engineer Serkan Gölge, are also jailed in Turkey. Turkish officials suspect that Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, who have strong political support from evangelical Christians in the U.S., believe that Brunson’s release could increase Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections in November. “Given the highly visible role of Vice-President Pence, the Turks believe there was a political calculation about garnering more of the evangelical vote,” Bryza said."

WASHINGTON (CNN Money) - The US economy surged into high gear in the Spring, growing at the fastest pace in almost four years.

Second-quarter economic growth came in at an annual rate of 4.1%, the government said Friday. That was the best showing since the third quarter of 2014.

By many metrics, the United States economy is in excellent shape: Unemployment is near an 18-year low, factories are seeing more orders, and exports are surging.

President Donald Trump and his advisers trumpeted the numbers in a news conference outside the White House, saying that the economy was on pace to grow at the fastest rate in 13 years.

""This is a boom that will be sustainable as far as the eye can see,"" National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow said. ""This is no one-shot effort.""

If the economy grows at 3% or more in 2018, it will be the highest annual rate since 2005.

Economists are generally predicting slower growth in the second half of the year, though, as the effects of the tax cut wear off and rising interest rates depress consumer spending. Economists also expect slower growth in 2019 and 2020.

""In one line: Looks great; won't last,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""If you borrow enough money from your grandchildren and throw it at the economy, it will grow faster, for a while.""

Already announced tariffs are forecast to be only a slight drag on economic growth unless more are imposed. And it seems that corporate executives are treading carefully, as surveys of business confidence and hiring expectations begin to flag.

The strong second-quarter growth reflected large increases in orders of durable goods, investment in non-residential construction, exports, intellectual property, and government defense spending.

Weak home construction and increased imports, which subtract from economic growth, took it down a notch.

Growth in the first quarter was revised up slightly, from 2% to 2.2%, while the fourth quarter of 2017 dropped from 2.9% to 2.3%.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, a key metric that the Federal Reserve uses to decide whether to raise interest rates, came in at 1.8%, down from 2.5% in the first quarter.

255,Trump administration rolls back plans to raise fuel economy standards for autos - CNBC,Trump administration rolls back plans to raise fuel economy standards for autos  CNBC,"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDgvMDIvdHJ1bXAtYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24tcm9sbHMtYmFjay1wbGFucy10by1yYWlzZS1mdWVsLWVjb25vbXktc3RhbmRhcmRzLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxOC8wOC8wMi90cnVtcC1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1yb2xscy1iYWNrLXBsYW5zLXRvLXJhaXNlLWZ1ZWwtZWNvbm9teS1zdGFuZGFyZHMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNBC,"The Trump administration on Thursday revealed its long-anticipated plan to roll back Obama-era standards meant to cut planet-warming emissions from tailpipes and boost fuel efficiency in cars and trucks sold in the United States in the coming years.

At the same time, the administration confirmed it will seek to strip California of its special authority to set its own fuel economy levels for autos, escalating a legal battle with more than a dozen states. Shortly after the announcement, 19 states and Washington D.C. said they intended to sue over the revision.

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and Environmental Protection Agency say they intend to reverse ambitious targets for fuel economy and emissions reductions, which the agencies developed under President Barack Obama. Instead of requiring automakers to steadily increase the average fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles through 2025 as previously planned, the Trump administration would freeze those levels after 2020.

That would mean the fleet of cars and light-duty trucks that automakers release each year will only have to average about 37 mpg by 2026, rather than targets near 50 mpg envisioned by the Obama administration. Those fleets would also be allowed to emit more greenhouse gases for each mile driven under the Trump plan.

To be sure, those are simple, round numbers that mask the complicated formulas behind the standards, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE. But put simply, the Trump administration is trying to ease regulatory burdens for American automakers, even though the industry sought less drastic changes to the CAFE standards.

The proposal would lower the hurdles that automakers face in meeting tougher standards, especially as demand for trucks and large, less fuel efficient vehicles remains healthy. However, the administration's decision to revoke California's special status opens a path to an outcome the industry has long tried to avoid: having to engineer cars and trucks for two different sets of fuel economy standards in the United States.

California, along with 16 other states and Washington D.C., sued the Environmental Protection Agency in May after the administration said it would lower the Obama-era standards. The federal government has long issued California a waiver so it can combat pollution levels that are higher than in the rest of the country.

""Federal rules to limit tailpipe pollution and improve fuel economy are our best strategy to reduce carbon pollution, improve air quality, and save drivers money on gas,"" the 20 attorneys general that intend to sue said in a statement on Thursday. ""The Administration's proposal to weaken these rules will cause the American people to breathe dirtier air and pay higher prices at the pump.""

The CAFE standards stretch back to the 1970s and were designed to cut fuel consumption and bolster U.S. energy security in the wake of the Arab Oil Embargo. The Obama administration accelerated efforts to boost fuel economy and integrated that push with a new focus on cutting planet-warming emissions.

Automakers got on board with more aggressive mpg targets after being bailed out by Washington in the wake of the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago.

However, Americans have not gravitated toward fuel efficient cars, electric vehicles and hybrids as much as anticipated. That means automakers have to achieve better fuel economy by improving the fossil-fuel engines and by designing lighter and more aerodynamic models, said Carla Bailo, president and CEO of the Center for Automotive Research.

""It would have really created quite a strain,"" she said.

The Trump administration argues that the industry has picked the low-hanging fruit when it comes to technology improvements. Consequently, finding ways to squeeze more mileage out of a gallon of gasoline will become increasingly expensive, it says. That threatens to raise prices for automakers and consumers alike, the administration warns.

Those claims are disputed by some analysts. Tougher standards are financially feasible through 2030, while estimates for the cost of complying with fuel economy and emissions rules are overstated by as much as 40 percent, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit that provides analysis to environmental regulators.

However, consumer trends do create challenges for car manufacturers trying to hit the goals.

When oil prices are high and car buyers are focused on fuel costs, companies typically have an easier time selling the smaller, more fuel efficient cars that help them hit the fleet-wide targets. But when the price at the pump falls — as it did between 2014 and 2016 — demand typically rises for SUVs and trucks, skewing the average mpg of an automaker's fleet higher.

The Trump administration argues the Obama-era standards could leave dealers with showrooms packed with small, fuel-efficient cars that shoppers don't want. That could cause vehicle owners to keep their old trucks rather than trading up to a new model with better fuel economy and pollution control, it says.

The policy change does not necessarily mean automakers will stop improving fuel efficiency. Car companies typically try to harmonize their fleets for the global market to the best of their ability, and other parts of the world are still pushing forward policies to improve fuel economy standards and put more electric vehicles on the road.

Bailo says the lower standards will offer automakers relief in their pickup truck segments, a particularly strong business in the United States. But the manufacturers are still likely to focus on fuel economy in sedans and crossover vehicles that sell well around the world."

And at a moment when the Republican Party could be reaping the benefits of the good economic news, the GOP’s congressional majorities remain in jeopardy as a sizable group of voters prepare to make their indignation toward the president known at the ballot box in November.

“Personal aspects are the shock absorbers, and Donald Trump has no shock absorbers,” says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.

The poll’s economic news shows a rosy picture for a nation 10 years removed from a crippling recession. Nearly seven-in-10 Americans say that they are satisfied with the overall state of the economy, a share last seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Sixty-nine percent say they are either very satisfied (21 percent) or somewhat satisfied (48 percent). That’s up sharply just since June 2015, when just 37 percent said they were satisfied.

That economic confidence is also not limited to Trump’s own loyalists. Those feeling good about the state of the nation’s economy now include 86 percent of Republicans, 65 percent of independents and even a majority — 57 percent — of Democrats.

Additionally, 39 percent of all Americans say they’re ready for an economic expansion for themselves and their families, the highest share since 2005.

And while Trump’s signature tax reform bill remains unpopular overall, views of the package have improved somewhat since last month. Thirty percent of the public call the bill a good idea, while 38 percent call it a bad idea. That’s up from just 24 percent who called the tax plan a good idea in December.

But despite all those data points, Hart notes, Trump remains weighed down by the public’s personal dislike, even when his policy positions might otherwise be appealing to many voters.

“There’s just such a corrosive negative effect that those positions are not enough to lift those people who are in the middle or who are uncertain about him,” Hart says. “That’s his challenge.”

“Not a role model”

Trump’s historically low job approval ratings are well-known, but the new poll gives new insight into how many Americans dislike him personally.

A majority — 52 percent — told pollsters that they don’t like Trump personally and that they disapprove of many of his policies. (That’s up 9 percent since this time last year.) An additional 17 percent say that, while they agree with Trump on most policy matters, they dislike him personally, a category that includes 26 percent of Republicans.

Just 29 percent overall say that they are confident that Trump has the right set of personal characteristics to be president.

Trump also does not benefit from much public sympathy when it comes to his personal life.

Just 35 percent of Americans feel positive about Trump’s role as a family man, while 33 percent say they feel negative. That’s a deep personal hole compared to where Barack Obama stood on the same question; in January 2010, 72 percent said they felt good about Obama as a husband and father, while only 5 percent disagreed.

A mere 17 percent say they feel positive about the president’s presence as a role model, while 61 percent disagree, including 67 percent of mothers surveyed and 58 percent of fathers.

The midterms and “the black hole”

The poll has some potential good news for Republicans who are nervously eyeing their re-election prospects in November. The Democratic advantage on the generic ballot is down to six points, compared to 11 points last month. In December, 50 percent of Americans said they preferred a Democratic-controlled Congress after the 2018 election, while 39 percent favored one led by Republicans. Now, 49 percent say they want to see a Democratic Congress, while 43 percent pick the GOP to lead on Capitol Hill.

But there is also some evidence that, as in past midterm waves, voters energized by opposition to the president could still be an overwhelming factor in November.

Asked about the message they hope to send with their 2018 vote, 38 percent say they want to send a signal of opposition to Trump, while 26 percent want to signal their support for him and 34 percent say their vote doesn’t have to do with the commander in chief at all. In historical context, that 38 percent who say they’ll go to the ballot box largely to oppose the president should alarm the GOP; it’s the highest percentage of Americans wanting to send a midterm message to the president since October 2006, shortly before George W. Bush’s party lost 30 House seats.

McInturff, the GOP pollster, says that Republican campaigns may be able to leverage positive economic news to their benefit, but they will also have to navigate around the “black hole” of Trump’s omnipresence in the news cycle.

“This president will make that very hard,"" McInturff said. ""It’s very hard to get any traction on anything, so far, other than the president personally.""

Biden, Obama top list of popular politicians

As Trump’s constant time in the spotlight does little to boost his likeability, the most popular politicians asked about in the January NBC/WSJ poll are those who are out of office entirely — at least for now.

Joe Biden, the former vice president (and potential presidential contender), is viewed favorably by 54 percent of Americans, while just 22 have a negative view.

Former President Barack Obama is viewed positively by 57 percent, while 29 percent give him a thumbs-down.

Also enjoying a strong favorability rating is former President George W. Bush, whose 46 percent approval rating is the highest of his post-presidency.

It’s more of a mixed bag for Mitt Romney, the former presidential candidate and possible future Senate contender, who is viewed positively by 29 percent of Americans, while 30 percent view him negatively. But Romney is faring better than many of his GOP counterparts currently serving in government, like Paul Ryan (net -5 percent favorability), Mike Pence (net negative -6) and Mitch McConnell (net negative -26)

Oprah Winfrey, who has been discussed as a potential presidential candidate in 2020, has an approval rating that stands at 48 percent positive, 24 percent negative. But there’s a huge partisan divide, with 66 percent of Democrats but just 26 percent of Republicans giving her high marks."

In a speech at the White House, Trump said the tariffs would protect U.S. manufacturers who have been “targeted for years and years” by unfair trade practices by other countries. He also linked the issue to national security, arguing that the U.S. military would benefit from stronger steel and aluminum sectors.

“The actions we’re taking today are not a matter of choice, they’re a matter of necessity,” Trump said.

Trump said that the tariffs — 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum — will take effect in 15 days. But he said individual countries could negotiate with the U.S., leaving open the possibility that some might be exempted from the tariffs.

“We’re going to show great flexibility,” Trump said, adding, “we just want fairness. We want everything to be reciprocal.”

READ MORE: What is the Trump trade doctrine? His economic adviser explains

Trump has long argued that the tariffs would grow the American economy and help reduce the country’s trade deficit. He invited supporters of the tariffs to the White House ceremony, where several said they would benefit from the change.

But in recent days, as it became clear Trump would move forward with the tariffs, the proposal was met with near-universal opposition from economists, academics, business leaders and even some top officials in the Trump administration.

Earlier this week Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, announced that he would resign in the coming weeks; Cohn had argued strongly against the tariffs, though he didn’t cite them as a factor in his decision to step down as head of the National Economic Council.

We spoke with trade experts, economists and business leaders to get their perspectives on the tariffs and how they might impact the U.S. economy.

Would President Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports help create more jobs in the United States, as he argues?

GARY CLYDE HUFBAUER, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and former deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy at the Department of Treasury:

Not at all. The tariffs will create jobs in the steel and aluminum industries — my generous guess is not more than 15,000 jobs — but they will destroy three or four times as many jobs sprinkled across the economy. The political optics, however, favor Trump’s argument because the jobs created will be concentrated in specific plants and cities, lending them to “feel good” news reports, while the jobs destroyed will be widely dispersed, thus not exciting copy for “feel bad” news stories.

JEFFREY FRANKEL, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School and former member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton:

“Positive effects will be far outweighed by negative effects on other sectors.”

The import tariffs are likely to create a few jobs specifically in the U.S. firms that make steel and aluminum. The important point, however, is that such positive effects will be far outweighed by negative effects on other sectors. This is especially true of those manufacturing sectors that use steel and aluminum, such as the auto industry, heavy-equipment manufacturers, beer-can makers, and so on. The net effect is likely to be negative even if there is no loss of U.S. exports. But there will in addition almost certainly be a loss of exports, and therefore jobs, in other sectors.

TORI WHITING, a trade economist at The Heritage Foundation:

The short answer to this is no. A report released this week by Trade Partnership estimates that roughly 180,000 Americans would lose their jobs as a result of these tariffs. (Modest employment gains in steel and aluminum are predicted at 33,000 jobs, resulting in a net loss of jobs.) This does not include the impact of retaliatory tariffs by U.S. trading partners. History supports this. In 2002, the U.S. lost 200,000 jobs in one year in steel-using industries due to tariffs of up to 30 percent on steel.

WATCH: Why this U.S. beer keg company is worried about Trump’s tariffs

PAUL CZACHOR, the CEO of American Keg Company, the only company that manufacturers steel beer kegs in the United States:

For our particular business it will not create more jobs. When we go to make a keg, our steel costs will be more expensive, but the low-cost import kegs are going to continue to use low-cost steel from China. U.S.-made kegs are already at a $15 premium now. That will rise to $25. It’s all driven on the price of steel. Customers will not pay that premium and we’ll lose business. That means we would have to cut jobs, and potentially might not be able to stay in business.

What impact would the tariffs have on U.S. consumers?

“Very, very few consumers will be able to identify how their pockets and purses are being picked.”

GARY CLYDE HUFBAUER: Consumers will pay, for sure, but since steel and aluminum are used at the beginning of the production chain for everything — from bridges, to autos, to buildings, to aircraft — very, very few consumers will be able to identify how their pockets and purses are being picked. That part of the price equation works to Trump’s political advantage. It’s the polar opposite of the political reaction to a gas tax increase.

TORI WHITING: A tariff is essentially a tax, and the purpose of that tax is to increase the price of an import. These taxes will make it more expensive for U.S. manufacturers to produce anything made from steel or aluminum, forcing them to increase prices. These price differences may be small for things like soup or soda cans, but price increases for larger products like a car will be noticeable. Even a 1 percent increase in the price of a car is $350.

PAUL CZACHOR: For certain industries I’m sure it would be minimal or insignificant. For other products, like a keg, it would be significant. It could raise the price of a keg by as much as $15 because the cost of the material is more than 75 percent of the cost of a keg.

How big of a ripple effect would this have on the global economy? Would other countries retaliate in ways that would have a significant impact on the American economy?

GARY CLYDE HUFBAUER: The direct ripple effect will be small in the U.S. economy and negligible in the global economy. Other countries, led by the European Union, will retaliate against iconic products produced in states with powerful Republican leaders. Again, the direct ripple effect will be small, but the hit to bourbon, peanut butter, orange juice and Harley-Davidson producers will be painful to those firms. The bigger ripple effect comes indirectly from the growing global perception that the United States is abandoning its historic post Second World War role as the steady anchor of the global economy.

JEFFREY FRANKEL: Yes, other countries are very likely to retaliate. They would be justified in doing so, since our national security excuse for these tariffs is flimsy in the extreme. (Very little of the steel or aluminum that we use is produced in China.) If one retaliatory round were the end of it, the negative effects might not be big enough to show up in global GDP — unless this is the shock that pricks a bubble in securities markets. The greater fear, however, is that this will not be the end of it, that it might even be the start of a steady unraveling of the global trading system that has contributed so much to global prosperity over the last 70 years.

TORI WHITING: The real area for uncertainty with these tariffs is in retaliation. Several trading partners, including the EU, have made it clear that they will retaliate. A tit-for-tat scenario between the U.S. and its closest trading partners is not in the interest of anyone. In the past, U.S. agriculture exports have been common targets for retaliation. Earlier this year, China announced its intent to consider targeting U.S. sorghum and soybean exports.

Trump has tweeted that winning trade wars is “easy.” Is that really true?

JEFFREY FRANKEL: That blithe characterization is one of the most misguided economic pronouncements yet to come out of the White House. I have an awful suspicion that Trump’s thoughts may run along the following lines: If we import more from a country than it imports from us, then the elimination of all trade costs them more exports than it costs us. But of course both countries lose big in a trade war. And if he thinks this is some sort of macho high-stakes game of “chicken,” where he expects the other side to back down, he should at least give some indication of what specifically he wants other governments to do. He hasn’t done that, so far as I am aware.

“A trade war is not in the interest of anyone, especially American workers and American businesses.”

TORI WHITING: A trade war is not in the interest of anyone, especially American workers and American businesses. The result will be higher prices here in the U.S. and decreased competitiveness for domestic businesses. It would also create uncertainty, likely leading businesses to halt plans to invest, hire new workers, or increase wages and benefits for their workers. It is the role of the president to advance economic policies that will benefit all Americans, rather than just a handful of well-connected companies.

PAUL CZACHOR: I don’t think that statement was appropriate. I do understand the difficulty of this, and I do appreciate the administration and President Trump trying to fix the steel and aluminium imports issue, [but] I don’t think it’s an easy task. I don’t know how the administration is going to tackle that. That’s one of my concerns.

The president seems to take a zero-sum approach to trade policy. Does that make sense in an increasingly global economy, where U.S. companies rely on an international supply chain to produce and export goods?

GARY CLYDE HUFBAUER: If President Trump learned anything about international economics at the University of Pennsylvania, the wisdom is long forgotten. His professors must be appalled. Trump’s single-minded approach to trade policy is the ancient, and long since discarded, mercantilist arithmetic: trade surplus is wonderful, trade deficit is terrible. For every winner there must be a loser. This primitive mindset ignores comparative advantage, economies of scale, learning through competition, spreading of R&D costs, and much else.

“Trump’s single-minded approach to trade policy is the ancient, and long since discarded, mercantilist arithmetic.”

JEFFREY FRANKEL: The international supply chain whereby we, like every country, depend on inputs of intermediate goods for our production, including for our exports, makes the costs of protectionism very immediate and tangible, perhaps more so than in the past. Again, barriers against imports of steel hurt the competitiveness of our auto industry. But the zero-sum approach to trade policy never did make sense. Adam Smith and David Ricardo showed this “mercantilist” fallacy 200 years ago, when they developed the classic argument for gains from trade. The principle was demonstrated the hard way, in 1930: the U.S. adopted the Smoot-Hawley tariff, other countries responded in kind, and global trade collapsed — which put the “great” in the Great Depression. Do we really have to repeat that experiment?

TORI WHITING: Trade is a win-win for all countries involved. Take North America for example. The North American Free Trade Agreement has allowed the region to become one of the most competitive areas for automotive manufacturing. Each of the three countries specializes in the part of the production process where it is most efficient and effective, sometimes resulting in products crossing the border half a dozen times before the final car is made. By utilizing diverse supply chains, we produce some of the best cars in the world.

PAUL CZACHOR: I don’t know if his approach is going to work or not. It’s more than one simple tariff. You’ve got to look at downstream products as well. As a country we need to do something. I just don’t know how we solve this without creating serious conflicts for downstream manufacturers."

If its primary proposal moves forward after a 60-day comment period, it would freeze fuel efficiency requirements and carbon standards through 2026 — substantially easing financial pressure on automakers but mounting a roadblock for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change.

Here’s a look at what the new standards might mean, both for your wallet and the environment. Transportation, remember, is the leading source of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S.

How we got here

The fuel efficiency standards currently under the eye of federal regulators predate the Obama administration by 40 years.

Congress first mandated the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards in 1975, forcing all automakers to meet federal criteria for fuel economy — that’s how far vehicles can travel on a gallon of gas. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sets this criteria.

When the Obama administration bailed out the auto industry, the president in return leveraged automakers to boost fuel economy standards, improve air quality and shrink carbon pollution.

Fuel economy improved rapidly in the decade after the law passed, reducing pollution and resulting in cost savings for consumers. But in the mid-1980s, consumers began shifting to large vehicles — SUVs, vans and trucks — which caused fuel economy to stagnate for nearly two decades.

In the 2000s, both Congress and the Obama administration introduced policy to counteract these consumer trends, increase fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, a Congressional law called on the Department of Transportation to set a fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020.

Two years later, when the Obama administration bailed out the auto industry, the president in return leveraged automakers to boost fuel economy standards, improve air quality and shrink carbon pollution.

First, the White House granted a long-sought waiver to California for the Clean Air Act that allowed the state to set its own carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars. This was one in a series of waivers that allowed the state to institute tougher rules for vehicle pollutants like carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxides. The move drew the ire of automakers.

“With today’s release of the administration’s proposals, it’s time for substantive negotiations to begin,” the Auto Alliance and Global Automakers said in a statement Thursday. “We urge California and the federal government to find a common sense solution that sets continued increases in vehicle efficiency standards while also meeting the needs of America’s drivers.”

The carbon waiver forces automakers into the expensive and laborious task of reworking their engines, tailpipes and other car technology to increase fuel efficiency. Since 2009, 12 other states and D.C. followed suit in adopting California’s strict tailpipe regulations. Colorado is currently mulling the policy.

In 2012, the Obama administration finalized the plan, which aligned national standards with California’s stricter rules. To relax the burden, Obama’s CAFE standards would be implemented in two stages — a gradual increase between 2012 and 2016 followed by a precipitous scale-up to 54.5 miles per gallon for new cars and trucks by 2025.

Why Trump wants the change

The Obama administration also granted broad powers to the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, meaning the agency can now set the agenda for these standards. This, in a way, led to today’s proposal, called the “Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks.

“Back in 2012, when the standards were set, the agencies were looking more than 10 years in advance, and they realized many things would change over that 10-year period,” EPA Assistant Administrator Bill Wehrum said Thursday in a conference call. “Built into the regulations was the idea that a reality check would be about halfway through.”

The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now want to freeze CAFE standards starting with cars and light trucks built in 2020. The move would cut short the scheduled ramp-up in automobile fuel efficiency. The EPA will also hold a public comment period on California’s Clean Air Act waiver for greenhouse gases.

The Trump administration and supporters of the new policy change argue that low gas prices and a wave of high-efficiency trucks reduce the need for strict emission regulations. Low gas prices also increase demand for trucks and SUVs, which cost more to produce under Obama’s plan for clean emissions.

Rolling back Obama’s rules could reduce the cost of making cars, which by extension, will drop the price of buying a car, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency estimates the average cost of owning a new car will decline by $2,340.

Heidi King, acting administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said an in-house analysis predicts that cheaper cars can also save lives because consumer won’t wait as long to purchase a new vehicle.

“Allowing consumers easier access to the new technologies for fuel economy, emissions profiles and safety could save up to a thousand lives annually,” King said. “Over the lifetime of all vehicles built through model year 2029, under the preferred alternative standard, over 12,000 fewer crash fatalities are estimated by our fleet-wide model.”

The agency’s analysis estimates $500 billion in savings for the U.S. economy, though half this amount comes through the relaxation of automaker regulations.

Why it matters

This depends on who you ask. Some will point to the pocketbook, others to the environment.

“These fuel economy standards would have saved consumers hundreds of billions of dollars at the pump.”

Obama’s plan to increase fuel efficiency has consumers purchasing less gas in the future to power their cars. Under this existing plan, the average U.S. household saves up to $2,000 per year. Economists have argued that Obama’s plan would increase the price of purchasing vehicles in the short-term, but also that the fuel savings would offset these costs within 3.5 years.

This does not account for the health and environmental costs — $37 billion annually — created by carbon dioxide pollution. Without the policy, Americans will consume more oil and will produce up to two times the amount of carbon by 2025.

These fuel economy standards would have saved consumers hundreds of billions of dollars at the pump, Oregon’s Senator Jeff Merkley, a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement.

“He’s putting our nation on the path to more childhood asthma, since these standards would have cut down on air pollutants that contribute to thousands of asthma attacks per year. And he’s willing to see more severe droughts, floods, wildfires, devastating hurricanes and the other effects of the climate chaos being driven by carbon pollution.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Humphrey/AP Mark Humphrey/AP

Updated Jan. 30

The job market is strong right now, with a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, and President Trump knows it.

In his State of the Union address, he said he is ""proud"" that ""African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic-American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.""

Earier this month, he also bragged about the latest jobs report, focusing in on minorities in particular.

On Twitter he cited that black unemployment is ""the lowest ever recorded in our country."" And he jabbed: ""Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!""

And then at a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation, he did it again, saying, ""African-American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our records.""

Presidents often take credit for a strong economy, and Trump fits that mold, touting jobs and stock market numbers regularly. So we decided to fact-check Trump on this claim: Is he right, and are these numbers his doing?

The claim

Black and Hispanic unemployment are at or near record lows.

The short answer

Trump's numbers are right, but it's generally a stretch for presidents to take credit for job creation.

The long answer

Trump is right that African-American unemployment hit a record low in December. The unemployment rate for black Americans is currently 6.8 percent, the lowest level recorded since the government started keeping track in January 1972.

And he's also right that the Hispanic unemployment rate is down a point over the last year — it was at 4.9 percent in December, down from 5.9 percent in December 2016. That is close to a record low, though it's also up 0.1 point from November.

But still, fact check: true on Trump's numbers.

However, that's not all Trump is doing in this tweet. He is implying that he caused these low African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates.

And a big problem with that claim is that those rates had been falling for long before Trump took office, and their declines don't appear to have picked up speed. This implies that there's nothing specific that Trump did to change this rate.

Indeed, both of these rates have been falling relatively steadily since around 2010, early in President Obama's tenure in the White House.

So have the unemployment rates for all races and ethnic groups tracked by the Labor Department. In general, these unemployment rates tend to move together. So while Trump called out the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates, they haven't changed in any remarkable way, relative to other groups' unemployment rates.

Separately, the president's Council of Economic Advisers touted the unemployment rate of other demographic groups on Friday, shortly after the latest jobs report was released.

""The overall unemployment rate, which by October had dropped to 4.1 percent, represented a 17-year low by year's end,"" they wrote. ""The benefits of the low rates were felt broadly, resulting in unemployment rates for America's veterans, African-Americans and Hispanics that reached historic lows in 2017.""

The total unemployment rate is quite low, at 4.1 percent. That's not a record, but for comparison with that African-American rate, it is near its lowest point since 1972.

So Trump here is trying to make a political point — one that he has made before — seeming to tell minorities that they should support him more than they do. But then, the president has a decidedly uneasy relationship with black Americans, as NPR's Brakkton Booker wrote on Saturday, and his rhetoric on immigration has also upset some Hispanics.

This leads to the bigger question of how much Trump has to do with any of this job growth, regardless of race or ethnicity.

By the jobs numbers themselves, it doesn't look like he has changed much here. In fact, the average job creation in Trump's first year is slightly lower than it has been in prior years. Employers added 171,000 new jobs each month, on average, in 2017. In 2016, that figure was 187,000, and in 2015, it was 226,000.

It is possible that the tax plan that Trump recently signed into law will inspire employers to hire more. Businesses could conceivably plow some of the money they save on their taxes thanks to that plan into job creation. In a late-November Yahoo poll of more than 1,200 business owners, half said the new tax plan would make them more likely to hire.

Then again, a majority of economists polled by the University of Chicago predict that long term, the tax plan won't lead to higher economic growth.

It's not that Trump has had zero effect on the economy. Though a strong global economy has been the main reason stocks are climbing ever higher, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in December, the president's agenda of deregulation and cutting corporate taxes has also likely very played some part in pushing stocks ever higher.

But the case that Trump has therefore significantly boosted job creation through the stock market isn't particularly strong, says one economist.

""To the extent that that affects business decisions, it may be that the president is having some impact on employment,"" said Michael Strain, director of economic studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""But it's very important not to overstate that.""

There's also a bigger problem with the idea that Trump has created all these jobs — presidents don't have much immediate control over the economy, period.

It's true that they push policies or make hires that can affect economic performance — George W. Bush first appointed former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who helmed the central bank as it worked to pull the country out of recession; and President Barack Obama signed the 2009 stimulus. It's also true that at the end of any given president's tenure, we look at the job market under that president.

But there's so much about the economy that presidents don't control — business cycles and other countries' economic health, for example. The White House also can't control broader macroeconomic trends, like the U.S. economy's long-term shift from goods-producing to service-based industries.

Indeed, a 2015 paper from Princeton economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson found that while the economy has tended to grow faster under Democratic presidents, policy actions don't appear to account for that difference.

""Democrats would probably like to attribute a large portion of the D-R growth gap to better fiscal (and perhaps monetary) policies, but the data do not support such a claim,"" they wrote.

So could a president — with Congress' help — target communities with particularly high unemployment? Yes, says one expert — particularly in one policy area Trump already has been championing.

""There needs to be a deliberate attempt to retrain and recruit people into the economy through infrastructure programs,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.

While the unemployment rate is relatively low — near what economists call ""full employment"" — it remains true that the black unemployment rate is always much higher than the national rate. He believes that targeted infrastructure policy could reduce that gap, helping disadvantaged Americans get back to work.

""Full employment means nothing to black folk in Baltimore or St. Louis or Pittsburgh,"" Perry said. ""For far too long, black unemployment has been the sacrificial lamb of full employment, and so again, if there is an infrastructure plan put on the table, it should be targeted at populations in areas that are largely out of work. [And] not only inner-city black America; it's also rural white men who are being left behind by the economy.""

If that's true, it seems likely to remain a hypothetical. Democrats and Republicans alike champion the idea of infrastructure, but partisan divides on how to do it remain so wide that passing an infrastructure package this year would most likely be a heavy lift."

The Appalachian state is, along with Delaware, just one of two states where poverty rose last year, bucking the national trend of growing incomes and declining hardship, according to U.S. Census data released earlier this month. West Virginia's poverty rate climbed to 19.1 percent last year from 17.9 percent, making it just one of four states with a poverty rate above 18 percent.

President Donald Trump plans to visit West Virginia on Saturday, when he's expected to tout his economic accomplishments. The president has said he's ""very proud"" of the state and claimed that he ""turned West Virginia around."" His administration has focused on reviving jobs in the coal industry, which has added about 2,000 jobs across the U.S. since Mr. Trump's inauguration.

Mr. Trump has boasted about the state's GDP growth, but its economy grew by 1.3 percent in the first quarter, or 37th in the nation and lagging the national rate of 1.8 percent, according to government data. It had fared better in 2017: up 2.6 percent for the year, tenth among the 50 states, compared with 2.1 percent for the nation.

Coal ""is a potent message,"" but it overlooks the reality of West Virginia's economy, said Sean O'Leary, senior policy analyst of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. ""The growth we've had is in low-wage industries. Folks who find jobs haven't found jobs that keep them out of poverty.""

President Trump acknowledges the crowd at a Make America Great Again rally in Charleston, West Virginia, on Aug. 21, 2018. Reuters

Jobs in low-wage industries have grown 14.5 percent since 2001 in West Virginia, compared with a decline of 2.8 percent in jobs that pay higher wages during the same time, according to the WVCBP's figures. The state has about 22,000 people employed in mining and logging, compared with 131,000 education and health care workers and 155,000 government workers, two of the biggest industries in the state, according to government data.

West Virginia's dismal trends point to an economic issue that's impacting states across the country: Workers at the bottom of the pay scale aren't benefiting from the growing economy. Their issues range from low pay to unstable and scanty work hours, which makes it difficult to earn a living wage. Almost one in four West Virginians is employed in a low-wage job, the WVCBP found.

""It's cashiers, retail sales people, service employees -- those are our fastest growing jobs, but those jobs don't pay very well,"" O'Leary notes.

At the Manna Meals soup kitchen, more people are coming in for nourishment, said its executive director, Tara Martinez. The Charleston soup kitchen served almost 10,800 meals in August, compared with about 9,700 in January.

""There's a direct correlation between the hopelessness and the lack of jobs,"" she said. ""The jobs that are available are minimum wage and part time -- they don't have benefits. When you have that, coupled with the hopelessness of, 'How do I get out of this cycle?' and having to go to a soup pantry, it's like a hamster wheel.""

The opioid crisis is another issue facing West Virginia, which Martinez said she believes is tied to low-wage jobs and a lack of opportunity. Her observations echo academic findings from Princeton economists Anne Case and Nobel Prize-winner Angus Deaton, who found rising mortality rates for less educated white adults in the U.S., which they called ""deaths of despair.""

And West Virginia plays directly into the issues highlighted by Deaton and Case. The state, whose population is 95 percent white, is frequently listed as one of the least educated states in the country.

About 21 percent of West Virginians between ages 25 to 64 has a college degree, according to the National Information Center for Higher Education Policymaking and Analysis. At the national level, about one-third of American workers have a college degree.

The post-recession economy has favored Americans with college degrees, providing them with both growing incomes and professional opportunities. But many who lack that credential have been left out of the recovery, as evidenced in West Virginia.

""People who don't have jobs or don't have any way out of this cycle, there's a hopelessness that overtakes them,"" Martinez said.

To be sure, West Virginia is coping with other hurdles in its battle against poverty, such as an aging population, higher rates of disability, and a small workforce compared with bigger states, such as New York or California. The state's small size -- just 1.8 million people last year, down 50,000 from 2010 -- means it's harder to lure employers to the state, O'Leary noted.

West Virginia had a net job loss of 26,000 from early 2012 to late 2016, according to a study from West Virginia University. And the state has the lowest labor force participation rate of all 50 states, at 53 percent.

Employment is growing slowly at a projected 0.7 percent per year through 2022, or below the national growth rate of 0.9 percent. At that rate, local employment isn't expected to reach its 2012 peak until 2021, the study found.

West Virginia's poor residents will face another burden beginning in October, when work requirements for food stamps go into effect across the state. Martinez said she believes the measure, which requires able-bodied adults without dependents to work, volunteer or receive job training for at least 20 hours a week to receive food stamps, will push more into poverty and ramp up demand for her soup kitchen's services.

""It's frightening and I'm worried and I'm doing everything I can to make sure our doors are still open,"" she said, noting that she expects demand for meals to rise by 30 percent. ""It's going to be a lot of fundraising and pleading.""

She added, ""You have huge companies, corporations that do really well and make a substantial profit and paying their employees as little as possible -- and their employees are on food stamps or other benefits."""

Suddenly, the person sitting across from me started receiving an unconscionable number of emails, messages, and calls on two devices simultaneously. As the polls from the American presidential election became public, this person had to leave the dinner to field the incoming flow of alarmed inquiries from international investors, who had just committed a substantial sum of money to a project under this person’s management. If I recall correctly, the Mexican peso had lost about 20 per cent of its value against the US dollar during that dinner – hence the investors’ nervousness. That was, as far as I can tell, the world’s first economic impact of Donald Trump’s presidency. What about the impact after one year in office?

Since before taking office on January 20th 2017, President Trump has been sending shock waves through policy circles, and his administration has been rather eventful. The President’s every statement (and tweet) is routinely scrutinised and the world has had much to say about him, his style, and his political positions.

Among the most contentious of President Trump’s political positions is his economic strategy – sometimes called Trumponomics. Trumponomics pursues growth through a combination of personal and corporate tax reduction and fiscal stimulus, particularly on infrastructure and defense. The other major pillar is the renegotiation of international trade deals to protect American companies and jobs.

The German economic research group CESifo included a special section of its latest quarterly World Economic Survey (WES) on how the Trump administration is doing, in terms of key economic policy outcomes, both domestic and international. The WES assesses global economic trends by polling over 1,000 economic experts in 120 countries (including the author of this piece) on the current economic issues and outlook for their own countries. This is what they said. (All the data mentioned below are taken from the WESQ4/2017 report.)

Trumponomics at one

Table 1 indicates the percentage of American and international economic experts who assessed that the Trump presidency has had a positive, negative or negligible effect on eight key economic policy domains in the U.S..

Most experts concur that Trump’s performance with respect to environmental protection and social justice is negative. The withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement surely had an impact on this observation. On the other hand, the plans of a tax reform that would allegedly help ‘normal Americans’ were still being discussed at the time when the WES data were collected. So, it probably played only a minor role on the responses.

Many experts were also critical of Trump’s performance on health care – probably due to the high profile campaign to repeal Obamacare that has often dominated the political debate in the first year. More than half of the American experts also believe that the Trump presidency has been unable to strike trade deals that are beneficial to the U.S., perhaps due to the decision to leave the Trans-Pacific Partnership within few days of taking office. International experts were much less negative in this respect.

On the positive side, according to most American experts, the first year of Trumponomics has reduced bureaucracy and improved the business climate as a whole. This attitude probably explains the record performance of the stock market. International experts, however, failed to highlight the same gains and consider the Trump Administration inconsequential in both respects.

After one year in office, the domestic economic policy the Trump Administration is judged negatively by economic experts. Interestingly, however, American experts are less negative than international ones.

Trump and the world economy

With an economy worth $18 billion, equivalent to 24.3 per cent of the world GDP, the U.S. is by far the largest economy in the world. As such, its policies are bound to have major repercussions on other countries too.

The WES also investigated the influence of the Trump administration on three key areas of international policy (table 2). While there are some differences in the exact percentages of American and international respondents, the overall results are very consistent. The balancing of international trade is perceived to have been not much affected by most, while many also say it was affected negatively. A large majority of American experts (and somewhat fewer international ones) also state that the Trump Administration has negatively influenced both peace and security and cooperation in multilateral forums and international organizations. So, in terms of international economic policy American experts are more critical than international ones.

r countries too.

The winners and losers of Trumponomics

Finally, the experts were asked about the impact on their own country (figure 1). Negative impact was pointed out by the majority of the respondents in traditionally rival countries, like Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, but also in traditional allies, like Canada and Mexico, which are U.S. neighbours and co-members of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Indeed, the NAFTA is being renegotiated under less than ideal auspices.

When asked directly about their opinion of the overall impact of the Trump Administration, 73.7 per cent of the experts said that it was negative for the world economy. Interestingly, however, only 42.3 per cent said that it had a negative effect on their own country.

During his first year in office, President Trump has often been portrayed as a divisive figure. Surely, this image will have affected the experts’ assessment of the economic performance of his Administration. No doubt, such assessment is overall negative. However, those who would seem closer to its consequences (i.e., international experts for international policy and Americans for domestic policy) are somewhat less critical.

The thriving economy looks to be bolstering Donald Trump’s approval rating -– but his personal unpopularity, especially among women, may be putting a ceiling on it.

The president remains poorly rated overall in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll -– 56 percent of Americans disapprove of his job performance, versus 40 percent who approve, and “strong” disapprovers outnumber strong approvers by nearly 2-1.

His average approval rating after 15 months in office (38-57 percent approve/disapprove) is the lowest on record in polls dating to the Truman administration.

See PDF for full results, charts and tables.

Still, it’s numerically Trump’s highest approval rating in a year, coming just as consumer confidence reached its best since February 2001 in the weekly Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index. And while he’s 16 points underwater in approval overall, Trump gets essentially an even split for his handling of the economy –- 46-48 percent (approve-disapprove).

If the economy helps Trump, his personal style appears to hurt him. By a nearly 2-1 margin (61-32 percent), the public sees him unfavorably “as a person” in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates. There’s a close link between this view and his job rating: Among those who dislike him personally, 84 percent also disapprove of his work in office.

That’s not always the case. In March 1999, after his impeachment trial, Bill Clinton’s personal favorability rating was even worse than Trump’s today, 67-30 percent, unfavorable-favorable. But Clinton managed a 64 percent job approval rating at the same time. His personal popularity was much less correlated with his job approval than Trump’s is today.

Trump’s rating for handling the economy, while better than his overall approval, also is weak in comparative terms. The last time consumer confidence was this high, Clinton had just left office with 76 percent approval for his handling of the economy, 30 points higher than Trump’s now. Clinton’s overall job approval was 65 percent, 25 points higher than Trump’s.

Additionally, while the economy helps Trump, he faces skepticism on one prominent economic initiative, the trade tariffs he’s threatened. Americans are more apt to think these tariffs will be bad for U.S. jobs than good for them, 49-36 percent.

That said, the tariffs –- aimed at cheap steel and aluminum imports -– are better received in the Midwest, where there’s an even division on whether they’re good or bad for jobs. And Trump’s approval rating has jumped 12 points in the Midwest since January to a new high, 48 percent.

Trump also is at a numerical high (by a single point) in job approval among men, at 49 percent approval; at majority approval (53 percent) among whites for the first time in a year; and has jumped to a new high among conservatives, 74 percent approval, up 9 points just since January. At the same time, his approval rating among nonwhites, 17 percent, is its lowest on record.

Gender Gap

Among the most prominent elements of public attitudes toward Trump is the vast gender gap in his basic ratings. While men divide evenly on his job performance, 49-47 percent, women disapprove by a 2-1 margin, 32-64 percent. And while men see him more unfavorably than favorably as a person by 12 points, 53-41 percent, women do so by a 44-point margin, 68-24 percent.

Education and race are additional factors. Seventy-three percent of college-educated white women see Trump unfavorably as a person, while just 35 percent of non-college white men share that assessment. Conversely, 70 percent of non-college white men approve of his job performance; only 34 percent of college-educated white women agree.

Trump’s challenges among women are evident in other data. As reported Friday, women are much more apt than men to support extending special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether or not Trump’s associates paid hush money to women who claimed they’d had affairs with him. Sixty-five percent of women support such an investigation, vs. 50 percent of men.

This is White House Economics 101: Though it is almost always undeserved, presidents take credit for good economies and try to blame others for bad ones. Putting that truism aside, let’s get under the economic hood and look at how great the U.S. economy really is right now. As always in expansions, there are strong spots and weak points.

Strength No. 1 is the job market, specifically the increase in jobs and the commensurate decline in unemployment. That Trump inherited this trend is beyond question. I extrapolated the trend in unemployment from its peak in early 2010 to the end of 2016, and then kept that same linear trend going through January 2017, when Trump took office, until now. The result is a jobless rate of 3.6 percent, almost exactly the current rate (3.8). Same for African Americans.

The same exercise with average monthly job growth reveals a slight deceleration, from about 200,000 per month to 190,000 since Trump took office. To be clear, that difference is both insignificant and expected: As we close in on full employment, job growth will tend to decelerate.

So, team Trump has every right to tout these trends, but there’s not a shred of evidence they have contributed to them. Still, they haven’t messed them up . . . yet.

They can legitimately take credit for juicing GDP growth, which has accelerated due to the deficit-financed fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and spending. Economists not in employ of the administration believe this sugar high will fade by around 2020, but for now, they have done something highly unusual: aggressively stimulate an economy that was heading toward full employment on its own.

Despite this added GDP growth, there are three ways today’s economy is significantly underperforming: wage growth, productivity growth and the fiscal outlook.

Given the tightness of the labor market, we should be seeing faster wage growth, and its absence is inconsistent with all that “best ever” stuff. The fundamental building block for middle-class living standards is the real (i.e., inflation adjusted) hourly pay of mid-wage workers, which has gone up only 0.6 percent per year since Trump took office.

In the full-employment latter 1990s, this working-class real wage grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, more than twice the rate it’s growing today. The job market was tighter back then: The unemployment rate was also around 4 percent but there were fewer working-age folks on the sidelines. So, one explanation for Trump’s wage problem is that there is more slack in the job market than that 3.8 percent unemployment rate suggests.

Another explanation for slow real wage growth is something most economists agree is the most serious shortcoming in today’s economy: slow productivity growth. The figure below shows that the growth of output-per-hour worked is creeping along at its lowest growth rate in decades.

Slow output-per-hour is typically cited as a constraint on trend GDP growth (as noted, their stimulus is, for the time being, counteracting that effect). But slow productivity growth is also a constraint on wages, making it harder for firms to both maintain profitability and boost worker pay. So, they are choosing profits over pay hikes, and given workers’ weak bargaining clout, they have been getting away with it.

Lastly, there’s the deteriorating fiscal outlook, which, of course, has Trump and the Republicans’ fingerprints all over it. My main fiscal concerns stem from the devious play by Republicans to cut taxes for their donor base and then whine about how we just can’t afford Social Security and Medicare. But the near-term economic impact of this play is also worth noting.

To finance the extra debt, the Treasury must significantly increase the supply of bonds, which lowers their price and raises their yields. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, worried about potential overheating, is also raising rates. Higher interest rates put upward pressure on debt service, and not just for the federal government but for the highly leveraged corporate sector. Of course, rates have been so low for so long that they have room to grow, but the transition to the higher rate regime is a risk factor.

Which serves as a reminder of another big risk in the economy. Somewhere out there, no one knows where, lurks the next recession. It is here where presidents make a big economic difference, and the thought of this administration and Congress having to quickly react to an economic downturn is a very scary one.

Depending on when the downturn hits, even with its recent rate hikes, the Fed may not have a lot of interest-rate firepower. Also, as of the late 2017, more than half the states’ unemployment insurance trust funds failed to meet the Labor Department’s minimum standard for recession readiness (11 of these states had less than half the recommended savings; California’s system is in particularly bad shape). Put it all together, and you’ll understand why recession-unpreparedness (and binge-watching the brilliant series “Deadwood”) keeps me up nights.

So, while I don’t begrudge team Trump their bragging — it’s standard practice — if anything, the strength of the economy underscores how little it has to do with this extremely chaotic presidency and an economic team that engages far more in wishful thinking than cogent analysis."

It does not take long to compile evidence to support my mild claim. First, President Trump misrepresents the actual conditions and trends of the economy he inherited from President Barack Obama. He has made a number of claims, for instance, that growth was in decline when he took office.

“Had I not won, we would have been in negative — we wouldn’t be at 4.2 percent. We would have been in negative numbers. We were going down. We were low, and we were headed down,” Trump said at a rally earlier this month.

However, a 4.2 percent Q2 growth rate is hardly an economic turnaround of historical proportions as Trump claims. The Obama administration had four quarters of higher growth than 4.2 percent and many others that were nearly as high. Annual growth rates since Trump was sworn into office also remain in the same range as they have been since 2010.

To go even further, he touts that the gross domestic product rate is higher than the unemployment rate for the first time in 100 years. This is simply wrong. Since the government began collecting the official data series tracking GDP and the unemployment rate in 1948, the annual rate of real GDP growth, measured on a quarterly basis, has exceeded the jobless rate more than 60 times.

“The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Second, on jobs, Trump attempts to take credit for trends in job creation that were well-established before he took office. It is true that the United States has experienced its longest streak of consecutive positive monthly job growth. But almost 80 percent of that — 75 months of the 95 in the streak — occurred under Obama. There was also not a marked improvement in the size of the monthly job growth figures or in monthly unemployment after Trump took office, despite his exaggerated claims on the contrary.

“We are breaking all Jobs and Economic Records but, importantly, our Country has TREMENDOUS FUTURE POTENTIAL. We have just begun!” he wrote on Twitter earlier this month.

Third, Trump claims that wages are up for the first time in a long time. Again, it doesn’t take much digging into publicly accessible government data to find that trends in wage growth have been rising steadily since 2014.

“Wages, for the first time in 18 years, are rising again,” Trump said in July."

Washington CNN —

President Donald Trump took the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday morning with an announcement: “After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth.”

Meanwhile, across the ocean, the Bureau of Economic Analysis was releasing new annual numbers on the US economy – economic measures that, historically, look incredibly average.

Related: CNNMoney’s coverage

Those numbers showed the US economy grew by 2.3% over the first year of Trump’s presidency, a mark that indicates faster growth than last year but, so far, still falls short of Trump’s goal to hit 3% in GDP growth.

It’s also pretty average.

Take a look at what change in GDP has looked like over the last half century.

The average growth in GDP over former President Barack Obama’s second term? 2.2%. The average over the last two decades? 2.2%. The average back to 1970? 2.8%. And the average back all the way to 1930? 3.3%.

The year 2017 will place 11th in GDP growth over the last 20 years. (Recently, growth in the national economy was higher than 2013 and 2016 but lower than 2014 and 2015.)

This is according to a CNN analysis of data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Trump had predicted another quarter of GDP growth over 3% just this Wednesday in a speech to the country’s mayors.

“You take a look at your GDP then and take a look at what’s happened now,” he started. “We’ll have three quarters in a row over 3. We had 3.2, and a lot of people thought it would take two or three years to get there. And we’re going to be hitting 4 soon, and then we’re going to be hitting 5s.”

The fourth quarter of 2017 clocked in at 2.6% growth.

To be sure, there are lots of other measures of the current robustness of the American economy: the national unemployment rate is hovering near an all-time low and the stock market has soared to all-time highs over and over in recent months.

Plus, positive views of the US economy is at its best since 2000, according to recent CNN polling.

Still, throughout his campaign, he predicted that GDP growth would hit 3% – stretching his prediction to include even faster change recently.

“I see no reason why we don’t go to 4, 5, and even 6%,” he said in a December Cabinet meeting. “And I don’t want to go beyond that because then it will be criticized if we don’t hit it.”"
267,Gary Cohn resigns as Trump's top economic advisor - CNBC,Gary Cohn resigns as Trump's top economic advisor  CNBC,"Tue, 06 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDMvMDYvZ2FyeS1jb2huLXBsYW5zLXRvLXJlc2lnbi1hcy10cnVtcHMtdG9wLWVjb25vbWljLWFkdmlzb3ItbmV3LXlvcmstdGltZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNBC,"""He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.""

In his own statement, Trump said, ""Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again.

""I am grateful to the President for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the Administration great success in the future,"" Cohn said.

In a prepared statement, Cohn said, ""It has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform.""

The former Goldman Sachs president and free trade advocate Cohn, whose departure date will come in a few weeks, decided to quit after Trump announced he would impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

At a meeting with steel and aluminum executives last Thursday where Trump announced the move, Cohn argued against it, warning about price increases for steel and aluminum products, according to a person in the room.

An Axios reporter Thursday reported via Twitter that last Thursday Trump canceled a meeting that Cohn arranged for him with companies that use steel and aluminum in their products, in an effort to dissuade the president from imposing the tariffs.

Tweet

However, White House officials told CNBC earlier Tuesday that if Cohn were to resign it would not be only due to the president's decision on tariffs.

Tweet

Market watchers saw Cohn's potential departure as a bad omen for the White House's economic policy. He helped to shepherd massive tax cuts, the Trump administration's only major legislative achievement, which the president signed into law in December.

Tweet

Cohn also faced pressure to step down following Trump's defiant response to violence at a white nationalist rally in August. In an FT interview published that month, Cohn said he faced pressure both to leave Trump's White House and to stay in it. He even drafted a resignation letter, according to The New York Times.

The economic advisor told the FT that the White House ""must do better"" following Trump's widely criticized response to violence at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The interview may not have helped his case with the president.

The president's chaotic Trump Tower press conference in which Trump appeared to equate torch-bearing white nationalists with the protesters who demonstrated against them also fueled the possibility of Cohn, who is Jewish, resigning. ""Not all"" the people participating in the rally were bad, the president told reporters three days after a counterprotester was killed in a car ramming, allegedly by a suspected white supremacist.

""Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the K.K.K.,"" Cohn told the FT. ""I believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities.""

Cohn was Goldman's no. 2 executive when Trump named him as his top economic advisor. Trump offered the former Goldman Sachs president the key economic post on Dec. 9, despite bashing the firm during the 2016 campaign. Cohn also had been seen as a possible chairman of the Federal Reserve.

The shift amounts to a major change in the GOP’s approach to the management of the economy, and it promises to shape the success of everything from American agriculture and manufacturing to the companies that produce the nation’s electricity.

On Friday, citing national security, Trump ordered the Energy Department to compel power-grid operators to buy from ailing coal and nuclear plants that otherwise would be forced to shut down because of competition from cheaper sources.

The order came one day after the president imposed historic metals tariffs on some of the country’s strongest allies and trading partners. Now the Commerce Department is further picking winners and losers as it weighs thousands of requests from companies for waivers from the import taxes.

“It replaces the invisible hand with the government hand,” said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. “You’re replacing the market with government fiat.”

The president has chastised individual companies, second-guessed the U.S. Postal Service’s business arrangement with Amazon and put pressure on Boeing and Lockheed Martin over the cost of their products.

Trump’s order to Energy Secretary Rick Perry to stop the shutdown of coal and nuclear plants is the latest example of government intervention. The method will probably resemble a 41-page memo discussed this week by the National Security Council and at a Cabinet deputies-level meeting.

According to the memo, the Energy Department should invoke emergency authority under Cold War legislation — the Defense Production Act of 1950 and the Federal Power Act — to require regional electricity grids to purchase electric power from a list of plants chosen by the department. The memo said the criteria would be reliability, a quality that is the subject of hot debate.

The activist group Earthjustice issued a statement titled “Trump Administration Resorts to Soviet-style Takeover of Private Energy Markets To Keep Dirty, Uneconomic Coal Plants Running.” Staff attorney Kim Smaczniak said “no law gives the administration the power to set energy prices.”

The companies running regional electricity grids operate under a competitive bidding process that has won praise from environmental groups, utilities and regulators.

Those regulators, the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, rejected a similar Energy Department rescue for coal and nuclear plants in January.

But utility industry executives now worry that Trump is insisting on forcing through a plan akin to the rejected one because of political rather than economic concerns.

Industry experts expect that the Appalachian coal mining firm Murray Energy and the Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy — which first broached the idea of a rescue plan to Perry last year — will be near the top of the list of companies benefiting from Trump’s order.

Murray chief executive Robert Murray and FirstEnergy chief executive Charles E. Jones Sr. have contributed heavily to Trump and GOP political activities.

Murray presented an emergency plan to Perry in March 2017, days after Perry became energy secretary. Murray and Jones met Trump together in August 2017 to appeal for aid to prevent a FirstEnergy subsidiary from filing for bankruptcy, which it did anyway in early April. FirstEnergy’s highly paid lobbyist Jeff Miller was Perry’s campaign manager when he ran for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, and Trump dined with Miller and a small number of other reelection strategists that week.

Of course, Trump isn’t the only one to tinker with market forces. President Barack Obama backed subsidies for wind and solar power. And about 30 states have adopted laws mandating minimum purchases of renewable energy.

Obama also won passage of a health-care reform package that created winners and losers. Republicans criticized the Affordable Care Act at the time for forcing people to make purchases through the individual mandate.

Now Trump’s economic assertiveness is beginning to draw a response from congressional Republicans. On Friday, in the wake of the announcement on steel tariffs, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) said that he and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) would co-sponsor legislation “to rein in the executive branch’s power to impose unilateral tax increases like these.”

Toomey, who said the import taxes would hurt American workers and employers, tweeted: “Congress should assert its constitutional responsibility and lead on trade policy so Americans keep access to affordable goods and services, and the opportunity to sell our products abroad.”

The trade tariffs have alarmed some traditional Republican free-market enthusiasts.

“One of the reasons tariffs are not good policy in general is that it is a form of corporate welfare,” said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation. “You’re saying consumers will have to pay more so this auto company or steel company or aluminum company stays in business. It’s the ultimate form of picking winners and losers.”

The implementation of the tariffs illustrates how Trump’s interventionist impulses are creating a cumbersome, bureaucratic process with Washington sitting in the middle.

In March, when the president announced plans to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, he allowed companies to petition the Commerce Department for waivers.

The department said it would allow companies to escape the tariffs if they relied upon foreign suppliers for steel or aluminum products that were unavailable in the United States in “satisfactory quality or in a sufficient and reasonably available amount.”

While the department promised decisions within 90 days, the process has bogged down amid several thousand applications for relief. To obtain an exclusion, each steel user must fill out a lengthy Excel spreadsheet, detailing for government bureaucrats its product needs, including the chemical composition, dimensions, tensile strength, coating, magnetic permeability and global and local “ductility.”

Separate forms must be filled out and submitted for each product. Applicants must identify potential or existing domestic suppliers and — if they don’t have any — explain to the government how they determined that no U.S. producer could meet their needs.

NHK of America Suspension Components in Bowling Green, Ky., a manufacturer of suspension coil springs for automakers including Ford and Toyota, told Commerce in an April 20 filing that there has been no domestic maker of the type of steel it requires since the closure of a Republic Steel plant in Lorain, Ohio, two years ago.

Even though — thanks to Trump’s tariffs — Republic Steel plans to restart that facility this summer, it will take “multiple years” to qualify it as a new supplier, Metal One America, NHK’s importer, said in a related filing.

In the exclusions process, Commerce officials also are tasked with refereeing arcane disputes between steel companies over what specific products are and are not available in the United States.

On May 23, Nucor — the largest domestic producer — called upon Commerce to reject an exclusion bid by London-based Evraz that would allow it to import steel slab from Russia. “Evraz is requesting an exemption for approximately 1.9 million metric tons of Russian slab to be rolled into hot-rolled coil, plate in coil, cut-to-length plate, and large diameter pipe in the United States based on claims of nonavailability and national security concerns,” Nucor said in a 25-page document. “There is no merit to these claims.”"

Speaking in Tampa, on Tuesday night, Trump claimed, “We have the best economy in the history of our country.”

That was blatantly false, of course. On many occasions, the U.S. economy has been better, and has grown faster, than it is now. And there are reasons to be cautious about the long-term significance of the latest G.D.P. figure. For one thing, it was boosted by a number of one-off factors, including a surge in soybean exports as farmers rushed to beat the imposition of Chinese tariffs. There is also little sign of the boom in business capital investment that supporters of last year’s big G.O.P. tax cuts promised. And, with Trump still threatening to expand his trade war with China, there is a good deal of uncertainty about where things will go from here.

But it’s worth considering what might happen if this growth spurt persisted for a while, which—given higher spending by consumers and government agencies—is not beyond the bounds of possibility. The tax cuts that Congress approved in December, along with the spending increases it approved in February, amounted to a sizable Keynesian stimulus package—Republican paeans to the merits of small government notwithstanding. According to analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the tax cuts and spending increases will add about two hundred and seventy-six billion dollars in spending to the economy this year, or about 1.4 per cent of G.D.P. Many economic forecasters are now raising their estimates for the rest of the year. Goldman Sachs’s tracking estimate for G.D.P. growth in the third quarter is 3.4 per cent. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “GDPNow” estimate is five per cent. Macroeconomic Advisers, a leading economic consultancy, is predicting G.D.P. growth of three per cent for all of 2018, which would be the highest figure since 2005.

Going into the midterm elections, a higher rate of growth is obviously a positive thing for the political party in power, although history suggests that it won’t necessarily be enough to preserve the Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Consider what happened in 2014. Despite annualized G.D.P. growth of 5.1 per cent in the second quarter, Republicans took control of the Senate from Democrats and enlarged their majority in the House. A big problem for Republicans this year is that, so far, the pickup in G.D.P. growth hasn’t led to a rise in wages. When you take into account price inflation, hourly and weekly earnings are basically unchanged from this time last year. The biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s and the G.O.P.’s policies have been owners of capital—investors and senior corporate executives who have used the savings from the tax bill to buy back more of their companies’ stocks.

It’s telling that Trump and his political advisers seem determined to make the election primarily about wedge issues, such as immigration and “the Wall,” rather than the economy. They know that they have a difficult fight ahead. The polls show that Democrats have a good chance of taking the House, while the Senate looks like a toss-up. If the G.O.P. loses next week’s special election in Ohio’s Twelfth Congressional District, which it has held for thirty-five years, it will be another alarming sign for the Party. And it’s surely significant that in a last-minute ad blitz for the embattled Republican candidate, Troy Balderson, the G.O.P.’s Congressional Leadership Fund chose to focus on Nancy Pelosi rather than the economy.

Of course, the midterms aren’t the only elections on the horizon. An intriguing question is what the current growth spurt means for the prospects of Trump getting reëlected two years from now. The general rule is that higher rates of G.D.P. growth help incumbents. But many economists suspect that the recent good news could well be paving the way for a significant slowdown, and quite possibly a recession, in 2020, as the boost from tax cuts and higher government spending fades. It is at least conceivable that Trump could fall victim to a boom-bust cycle of his own making.

Back in March, before the effects of the stimulus package were being reflected in the official statistics, Macroeconomic Advisers published a report titled “How Might the Expansion End? Boom and Bust Is a Real Risk.” The authors, Joel Prakken and Chris Varvares, note that G.D.P. growth “could turn out to be significantly stronger than currently expected, especially if improved business confidence contributes to a dose of positive ‘animal spirits’ resulting in more investment and hiring than is currently expected.”

Prakken and Varvares speculate that quarterly G.D.P. growth could rise to five per cent by the end of 2018, and that the unemployment rate could fall to below 2.5 per cent by the middle of 2019. In this scenario, as employers competed for workers, wages and price inflation would pick up, prompting the Fed to raise the federal funds rate to 5.5 per cent by late 2019. Together with the phasing out of the fiscal stimulus, that could cause a big fall in the stock market and, eventually, a recession. The report emphasizes that this is just one possible future, but it adds, “We view this Boom/Bust scenario as a highly plausible way for the current expansion to end.”

When I spoke to Prakken, on Thursday, he said he put the probability of such a scenario playing out at about twenty-five per cent. But he also emphasized that even if the “boom” part of the scenario doesn’t materialize—i.e., G.D.P. growth and inflation don’t pick up further from here—there are dangers ahead for the economy. By the end of next year, the stimulus will be phasing out, and the Federal Reserve may well still be raising interest rates. On top of that, current law calls for a return to the sequestration of spending in 2020, which would amount to a significant fiscal contraction. “There’s clearly a point of vulnerability out there,” Prakken noted. “The policy mix could shift in a recessionary direction in late 2019 and early 2020.” There’s also the possibilities of higher oil prices and intensifying trade conflicts. “All of those things would accentuate the bust part of the boom-bust cycle,” Prakken said.

He isn’t alone is expressing these types of worries. Outside of a few redoubts of supply-side economics, such as the White House, the consensus among economists is that the effects of the stimulus will be strictly temporary, and that, once it fades, over-all economic growth will slow sharply. In the latest quarterly survey by the National Association for Business Economics, two-thirds of the economists surveyed saw the next recession starting by the end of 2020.

To be sure, the gloomy economists could be proved wrong. Economic forecasting is an imperfect science, and its relationship to political forecasting is even more imperfect. Even if a sharp downturn does materialize in 2020, Trump could conceivably ride a wave of jingoism, resentment, and voter suppression to another victory in the Electoral College. But the economy is important. And the key point is that, two years from now, things might look very different than they do today."

But now, Kudlow, who emerged as a vocal Trump supporter during the 2016 election, will face a harder test as he’s tasked with selling Trump’s economic message to the entire country, in an election year where many voters remain skeptical of the president’s job performance and policies around trade.

Kudlow started his career at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York before joining the Reagan administration, where he worked in the Office of Management and Budget. But Kudlow is best known for his work as the host of two CNBC shows, both of which are no longer on the air, and as the current host of the weekly syndicated radio program, “The Larry Kudlow Show.”

Kudlow will need to tap into his years of experience developing a public persona and more recent role as an outspoken Trump ally to convince voters that the president’s policies are good for the economy.

“We have a booming economy now, and yet you have a president who has a 40 percent approval rating,” said Stephen Moore,a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who helped Kudlow work on the Trump campaign’s tax plan in 2016. “That means Larry has to go out there and sell this to the American public.”

Kudlow has wasted no time in doing that. In his first interview after the news of his appointment broke on Wednesday, Kudlow praised Trump effusively and hailed his economic achievements.

Kudlow will need to tap into his years of experience developing a public persona to convince voters that Trump’s economic policies are working.

“The economy is starting to boom,” Kudlow told CNBC. “The tax cuts are working. The deregulation is working. We’re going to get on to infrastructure. We’re going to get on to trade also. [Trump is] completely in command.”

Kudlow’s communication skills could also be a valuable asset as the White House pushes its agenda in Congress, where lawmakers have often balked at some of Trump’s proposals, including the president’s decision earlier this month to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Moore credited Kudlow with getting a number of lawmakers on board with Trump’s push for tax reform. A bill was eventually passed through Congress and signed into law late last year.

Kudlow “is a gifted communicator. He’s well respected by members of both Houses of Congress,” Moore said. “Even people who disagree with Larry like him.”

Robert Reich, a former secretary of the Labor Department under President Clinton who has debated Kudlow numerous times on television, said he likes Kudlow personally, despite disagreeing with him on “just about everything.”

“If you are asking me if he is a good choice for the country, the answer is a resounding no,” said Reich, a public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

Reich argued that Kudlow’s economic worldview disproportionately benefits the wealthy. But politics aside, Reich said, there is no disputing that Kudlow can make convincing arguments and is willing to speak his mind.

Whether Kudlow is willing to stand up to Trump when they disagree is unclear, however. Cohn opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs but ultimately lost the internal White House debate over whether to move forward with them. His decision to resign, two days before Trump announced the tariffs, was widely seen as a rebuke of the plan, though Cohn didn’t cite tariffs as his reason for leaving the White House.

Cohn’s departure was followed this week by Trump’s decision to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and nominate CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement. Trump told reporters that he had a “different mindset” from Tillerson on policy issues, and said he and Pompeo were on the same “wavelength.”

Tillerson’s ousting was another high-profile staff shakeup in a month of personnel changes. In late February, White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, one of Trump’s most trusted advisers, announced that she would resign. Two other top aides, Rob Porter and John McEntee, were fired in recent weeks amid scandal.

Kudlow’s supporters predicted that he would figure out how to fit into Trump’s circle of top advisers in the White House.

“Larry is a persuasive guy,” said James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the American Enterprise Institute and a regular guest on Kudlow’s shows. “Do I expect him to turn the president into the reincarnation of Adam Smith? No. But I hope he will be a headwind against some of those protectionist policies or make them less severe.”

Earlier this week, Trump acknowledged the gap between himself and Kudlow on some key economic issues, namely his move to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum.

Whether Kudlow is willing to stand up to Trump when they disagree is unclear.

“We don’t agree on everything, but in this case, I think that’s good,” Trump told reporters when asked about Kudlow. “I want to have a diversity of opinions.”

But Trump also said Kudlow had “come around” to his position that tariffs can be used as leverage to renegotiate trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. Kudlow has, in fact, softened his opposition to tariffs in recent days after the White House announced Canada and Mexico would be exempt.

“I don’t like blanket tariffs,” Kudlow told CNBC. “If you must, at least target them specifically. That will work.”

Kudlow’s appointment came as a relief to economists who had feared he might choose someone like Peter Navarro, the White House adviser on trade who was a major force behind the controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum. Navarro had been rumored to be on the shortlist to replace Cohn.

“If President Trump had picked Navarro, he would have been signaling he was just getting started when it came to protectionist policies,” said Betsey Stevenson, an associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan and researcher for the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Choosing Kudlow signaled that the president is at least willing to consider a more traditional approach to free trade, Stevenson said.

But others said Trump remained unpredictable.

“Kudlow is obviously coming in knowing there is a president who will make very sudden moves on things like tariff policies,” said Heidi Shierholz, the Economic Policy Institute’s senior economist, and a former chief economist at the Labor Department under President Obama. “So he knows what he’s walking into.”"

American Enterprise Institute,"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlaS5vcmcvZWNvbm9taWNzL3doYXRzLWJlZW4tdGhlLWVjb25vbWljLWltcGFjdC1vZi10cnVtcHMtZGVyZWd1bGF0aW9uLXB1c2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,American Enterprise Institute,"“Pro-growth” economic policy is about more than just tax reform. Smart deregulation also has the potential to boost growth. Indeed, the Trump administration is counting on deregulation as a key lever for turning a 2% economy into a 3% (or higher) economy. In a report last October, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers declared that “deregulation will stimulate US GDP growth” and favorably cites research finding that “excessive regulation” suppressed US growth by an average of 0.8% per year since 1980.

Of course this doesn’t mean that Trump’s deregulatory efforts will boost growth by nearly a percentage point or anywhere close. But the study does suggest regulation might be sub-optimal in a number of areas. For instance, President Trump hopes cutting environmental and other regulations will help get more bang for the buck out of his new infrastructure plan.

Now a new report from Goldman Sachs splashes some cold water on the deregulatory impulse, or at least tempers expectations. The report first notes that Team Trump’s talk about deregulation isn’t just talk. Washington issued fewer regulations last year — particularly those with an annual effect of $100 million or more — while “some existing regulations were delayed, weakened, or repealed,” according to the bank.

See also: WILL: To Boost Job Growth, Target These Regulations

But what has been the economic impact? To arrive at some answers, Goldman tries three different approaches:

First, the bank asked its analysts what they are seeing on the ground. And so far not much: “Today, our equity analysts in non-financial sectors report that deregulation has largely taken a back seat to tax reform and has had only a modest impact on economic decisions so far.”

Second, the bank looked at whether job growth and capital spending have been stronger in sectors and companies that were more highly regulated before the election. Goldman: “We find no evidence that employment or capital spending accelerated more after the election in areas where regulatory burdens are higher.”

Third, to try and get a more forward-looking view of deregulation — hey, it’s only been a year — Goldman looked at stock market performance. But not much there, either: “We find a roughly 0 correlation between regulatory burdens and post-election returns among the full set of S&P 500 companies, consistent with our earlier results based on macroeconomic data.”

These findings don’t mean deregulation is unimportant. Going forward, the bank adds, financial deregulation might be especially meaningful. But as far as rules affecting the economic and business world outside Wall Street, not so much:

Overall, our results suggest that non-financial deregulation has had a limited impact on the economy to date. This is not that surprising for several reasons: the estimated costs of regulation are not that high; implementing regulatory change even by executive action can be slow and difficult; and some promising targets for change largely involve state and local rather than federal regulation.

Don’t zoom over that last part. Some of the most anti-growth regulation comes at the state and local levels, such as burdensome land-use rules and labor market rules such as occupational licensing and noncompete agreements."

In the time Donald Trump has been in the White House:

The economy added 3.2 million jobs, unemployment fell to the lowest level in 18 years, and the number of job openings grew larger than the number of job-seekers for the first time on record.

Economic growth picked up, but remains below what Trump promised, and even below the best years under Barack Obama.

The murder rate declined — at least in the 30 largest cities.

The decade-long downward trend in carbon dioxide emissions from energy slowed — and has most recently turned upward.

Illegal border crossings from Mexico slowed, but Trump’s promised border wall is still not funded.

Inflation-adjusted weekly wages rose 1.2 percent.

Home prices rose 17 percent, to a record level.

The U.S. trade deficit continued rising — up 13.6 percent.

The federal debt rose by more than $1 trillion, and projected annual deficits increased.

Analysis

This is our second quarterly update of the “Trump’s Numbers” scorecard that we posted in January and updated for the first time in April. We’ll publish additional updates every three months, as fresh statistics become available.

As always, we’ve included numbers that may seem good or bad or just neutral, depending on the reader’s point of view. And we stress again that opinions differ on how much credit or blame any president deserves for things that happen during his time in office.

And we remind readers that some changes that have happened already during Trump’s time in office haven’t yet shown up in official statistics. FBI crime figures for all of 2017, as well as Census Bureau poverty and household income figures for 2017, won’t be released until later this year. We’ll cover those and more in quarterly updates to come.

Jobs and Unemployment

Employment — Total nonfarm employment grew by more than 3.2 million during the president’s first 17 months in office, according to the most recent figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That’s steady, solid growth to be sure, continuing an unbroken chain of monthly gains in total employment that started in October 2010.

But the average monthly gain under Trump is 189,000 jobs, which is nearly 13 percent below the monthly average of 217,000 during Obama’s second term.

Trump will have to pick up the pace if he is to fulfill his campaign boast that he will be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.” At the current monthly rate, a total of just over 18 million jobs would be added over eight years. That’s better than the 11.6 million added under Obama and the 16.1 million added under Ronald Reagan, but well below the 22.9 million added when Bill Clinton was president, and the population was smaller.

Unemployment — The unemployment rate — which was well below the historical norm when Trump took office — has continued to fall even lower, to the lowest point in 18 years.

The rate was 4.8 percent when he was sworn in, and then fell to 3.8 percent in May — a low not seen since April 2000 — before ticking up to 4.0 percent most recently, in June.

The rate also is well below the historical norm of 5.6 percent, which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948. The lowest unemployment rate ever recorded was in 1953, when the rate was 2.5 percent for a couple of months.

Job Openings — Another reason employment growth has slowed is a persistent shortage of workers. The number of unfilled job openings hit a new record of more than 6.8 million in April — the most in the more than 17 years the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking them. In March, for the first time on record, the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people looking for work, which was under 6.6 million.

In May, the number of job openings slipped back to 6.6 million — still the second highest on record and still just over the number of job-seekers. That’s a gain of nearly 1.2 million job openings — a rise of nearly 21.9 percent — since Trump took office.

Labor Force Participation — The labor force participation rate — which went down 2.8 percentage points during the Obama years — has remained essentially unchanged under Trump.

Republicans often criticized Obama for the decline even though it was due mostly to the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age, and other demographic factors beyond the control of any president.

Since Trump took office the rate has fluctuated in a narrow range from 63.0 percent to 62.7 percent. (That’s the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks.) It was 62.9 percent last month, exactly where it was the month Trump took office.

Manufacturing Jobs — Manufacturing jobs increased rapidly under Trump.

The number rose by 344,000 between Trump’s inauguration and June. That followed a net decrease of 192,000 under Obama.

The increase under Trump amounts to 2.8 percent, even faster than the 2.2 percent increase in overall employment.

However, the number of manufacturing jobs is still more than 1 million below where it was in December 2007, at the start of the Great Recession.

Economic Growth

Economic growth rebounded under Trump — but hasn’t reached the rate he promised, and is still below the best years under Obama.

The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.0 percent during the first three months of this year, according to the most recent official estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s the “real” rate of growth in gross domestic product after accounting for price inflation.

The most recent quarter’s growth is down from the 2.3 percent increase during Trump’s first full year, but still better than the 1.5 percent real GDP growth posted in 2016.

But the most recent 2.0 percent rate is lower than the four best years under Obama: 2.9 percent real growth in 2015, 2.6 percent in 2014, 2.2 percent in 2012 and 2.5 percent in 2010.

And it’s far below the annual growth of 4 percent to 6 percent that Trump promised repeatedly, both when he was a candidate and as president.

The first official estimate for the second quarter of 2018 won’t be released until July 27. However, the “GDP Now” forecast produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projected on July 6 that the second-quarter growth rate will come in at 3.8 percent — almost within the range that Trump promised.

But few if any economists expect sustained growth at anywhere close to what Trump has pledged.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects real GDP to grow 3.3 percent this year, and 2.4 percent in 2019, then settle to an average of 1.9 percent for decades to come.

The National Association for Business Economists June survey produced a median forecast of 2.8 percent growth this year and 2.5 percent next year.

The most recent median forecast of the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, released June 13, is for 2.8 percent in 2018, 2.4 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020.

And of the business and university economists who offered an annual GDP forecast to the Wall Street Journal‘s monthly economic survey in June, the average prediction was for 2.9 percent growth this year, 2.4 percent next year and 1.9 percent in 2020.

Regulations

The growth of federal regulation didn’t come to the “sudden, screeching and beautiful halt” Trump once claimed, but it does seem to have ground slowly to a stop over many months — at least for the moment.

The number of restrictive words and phrases (such as “shall,” “prohibited” or “may not”) contained in the Code of Federal Regulations went up by 0.73 percent during Trump’s first 15 months, reaching a peak of nearly 1.09 million on April 6, according to daily tracking done by the QuantGov project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.

But since then, the number has declined by 0.21 percent as of July 6. It remains to be seen if that decline is the start of a permanent trend, or just a temporary blip.

Overall, the drop still leaves a 0.5 percent net increase in restrictive words and phrases since Trump took office — a slower rate of rise than in the past. The average annual growth during both the Obama years and the George W. Bush years was just under 1.5 percent, according to annual QuantGov tracking.

The Mercatus Center database provides a hard count of specific legal mandates and prohibitions imposed by federal regulators, which we find to be more relevant than counts of the number of pages or words in the rulebook. It doesn’t attempt to assess the cost or benefit of any particular rule — such assessments require a degree of guesswork and are sensitive to assumptions. But it does track the sheer volume of federal rules with more precision than we have found in other metrics.

At a Dec. 14 event at the White House, Trump said, “We’ve begun the most far-reaching regulatory reform in American history.” A White House fact sheet said that since Trump took office federal agencies had “withdrawn or delayed 1,579 planned regulatory actions.”

Some are quite significant. Within a month of taking office, for example, Trump signed a law nullifying an Obama-era rule prohibiting coal mining companies from dumping waste into streams and waterways.

Crime

The murder rate declined in 2017 — at least in the 30 largest U.S. cities — according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.

The 30-city murder rate dropped 3.4 percent during Trump’s first year, after rising 13.1 percent in 2016 and 13.2 percent in 2015, the Brennan Center reported.

It’s still not known whether the murder rate for the country as a whole went up or down during 2017. The FBI’s annual Crime in the United States report for 2017 won’t be published for several more weeks. As we reported in our first update, a preliminary FBI report shows that during the first half of 2017 the nationwide number of homicides rose 1.5 percent, compared with the same period a year earlier, even as most other crime declined.

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly claimed that the murder rate was “the highest it’s been in 45 years.” That was wildly untrue. In fact, the murder rate had dropped to the lowest on record in 2014 — 4.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. And while it did rise for the next two years, it was still only 5.3 per 100,000 in 2016, lower than where it was the year before Obama took office.

An earlier Brennan analysis found “no evidence of a national crime wave” such as Trump had described. To the contrary, crime rates — both in the largest cities and nationwide — peaked in 1991 and “dropped precipitously in the last quarter-century,” the Brennan Center found.

The center’s most recent and final report of 2017 crime rates in the 30 largest cities found the rate for all crimes fell by 2.1 percent during Trump’s first year, to “remain at historic lows.”

Coal and Environment

Coal Mining Jobs — As a candidate, Trump promised to “put our [coal] miners back to work,” but so far not many have regained their jobs.

A total of 35,700 coal mining jobs disappeared during the Obama years, but as of June only 2,500 of them had come back under Trump, according to BLS figures. That’s just 7 percent of the coal mining jobs lost during the Obama years.

The outlook for coal miners remains bleak. The Energy Information Administration currently projects that U.S. coal production will decline 2 percent this year, and by another 2 percent in 2019. EIA expects there will be less demand for exports, and increased use of natural gas to generate electricity.

Carbon Emissions — Carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption have started edging up under Trump, after falling for years under Obama.

Revised figures from the Energy Information Administration show CO2 emissions at first fell by 0.9 percent in 2017, less than the 1.6 percent decline in Obama’s final year. They fell by a total of 14.4 percent between 2007 and 2017, due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal-fired plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, as well as solar and wind power.

But that downward trend that slowed sharply in Trump’s first year has now reversed entirely. Emissions during the most recent 12 months on record, ending in March 2018, were 0.24 percent higher than in all of 2016. And the rise is expected to continue.

EIA predicted in July that CO2 emissions “will increase by 1.8% in 2018.” These projections are sensitive to changes in weather, economic growth and energy prices — all difficult to forecast.

Border Security

Illegal border crossings declined under Trump, dropping sharply at first but lately rising again.

The number of people caught while illegally trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico each month plunged to a low of 11,127 in April of last year, according to figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But since then the number has more than tripled, hitting 40,338 in May before dropping to 34,114 in June.

Despite the recent surge, the monthly average during the first 17 full months of Trump’s tenure is still under 25,000. That’s a drop of 33 percent from the monthly average in 2016, the year before he took office (and 28 percent lower than the monthly average for all the months Barack Obama was in office).

Nevertheless, Trump imposed a “zero tolerance” crackdown at the border that resulted in nearly 3,000 immigrant children being separated from their parents, causing widespread public protests, after which Trump backed down and signed an executive order ending the forced separations.

Meanwhile, Trump’s promised border wall is still little more than that — a promise. A bipartisan spending bill that Trump signed in late March included enough money to start building some new barriers and to upgrade existing fencing and walls — but only along about 100 miles of the 2,000-mile border. Trump called that “just a down payment.” But what’s being built isn’t the sort of solid, concrete wall Trump once described during the campaign, and nothing like any of the prototypes that Trump visited in March.

Corporate Profits

Corporate profits rose to a record high of $1.78 trillion in 2017 — and are running even higher so far this year.

Those after-tax profits were 5.5 percent higher than the full-year figure for 2016, as estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see line 45), and they topped the previous record of $1.74 trillion set in 2014.

The BEA’s most recent estimate, covering the first three months of 2018, shows after-tax profits running at an annual rate of $1.86 trillion — an increase of 10.1 percent over the full-year 2016 figure.

After-tax profits are getting a boost this year from the tax cut Trump signed into law Dec. 22, dropping the top federal tax rate on corporate income to 21 percent, from 35 percent.

Stock Market

Stock prices continued their long rise under Trump, setting record after record. But they’ve since given up some of the gain.

As of the close on July 10, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average was within 3 percentage points below the record high set on Jan. 26 — and a solid 23.4 percent higher than it was on the last trading day before Trump’s inauguration.

Other indexes rose even more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 26.3 percent under Trump. And the NASDAQ Composite index, made up of more than 3,000 companies, set another record high as recently as June 20. At the close on July 10 it was 40.1 percent higher than before Trump took office.

The bull market that began in 2009, at the depths of the Great Recession, passed its ninth anniversary in March. It would require a 20 percent drop from the Jan. 26 high to qualify as a bear market.

Wages and Inflation

The upward trend in real wages continued under Trump, even as prices rose a bit faster.

CPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 percent during Trump’s first 17 months (through May of this year), continuing a long period of historically low inflation.

That’s an average yearly rate of 1.9 percent. The CPI rose an average of 1.8 percent each year of the Obama presidency (measured as the 12-month change ending each January), and an average of 2.4 percent during each of George W. Bush’s years.

Wages — Wage increases continued to outpace inflation, and so the purchasing power of weekly paychecks rose. The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 1.2 percent during Trump’s first 17 months, after going up 4.0 percent during Obama’s eight years.

Those figures are for all private-sector workers, including managers and supervisors.

For rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers (who make up 82 percent of all private-sector workers) real weekly earnings have gone up 1.5 percent so far under Trump, after rising 3.7 percent during Obama’s eight years.

Consumer Sentiment

Consumer confidence in the economy soared after Trump’s election, at one point reaching the highest point in 14 years. It currently stands higher than at any time during the Obama years (up until Trump’s election in November 2016).

The University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers reported that its Index of Consumer Sentiment hit 101.4 in March, the highest since January 2004, a month marked by general euphoria following the capture of Saddam Hussein.

The confidence figure has remained high, slipping most recently to 98.2, the final figure for June. That’s still just above the highest point between Obama’s inauguration and Trump’s election, which was 98.1 in January 2015.

The survey’s chief economist, Richard Curtin, said consumers in June still expected “small additional declines in the unemployment rate as well as higher wage gains,” but were concerned about the potential impact of Trump’s tariffs on the domestic economy.

Home Prices and Ownership

Home Prices — Home prices soared to record levels under Trump.

The most recent sales figures from the National Association of Realtors show the national median price of an existing, single-family home sold in May was $267,500, the highest ever recorded.

That’s nearly 17 percent above the median price of $228,700 for homes sold during the month he took office. The rise in the Consumer Price Index during the same period was just under 2.7 percent.

The Realtors figures reflect raw sales prices without attempting to adjust for such factors as variations in the size, location, age or condition of the homes sold in a given month or year. Even so, a similar pattern emerges from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which compares sales prices of similar homes and seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing single-family housing stock.

The Case-Shiller index for April sales also was a record high, and 8.7 percent higher than where it stood in the month Trump took office.

Whichever way you measure it, homeowners have seen the value of their houses rise dramatically since Trump took office.

Homeownership — Meanwhile the percentage of Americans who own their homes has continued to recover from a years-long slide, gaining 0.5 percentage points since Trump took office.

The homeownership rate peaked at 69.2 percent of households for two quarters in 2004. Then in the second quarter of 2016 it hit bottom at 62.9 percent — the lowest point in more than half a century, and tied for the lowest on record.

The rate recovered 0.8 points before Trump took office, and has continued rising to 64.2 percent in the last quarter of 2017 and again in the first quarter of 2018, according to the most recent Census Bureau figures.

Trade

The trade deficit that Trump promised to reduce grew larger instead.

The most recent government figures show that the total U.S. trade deficit in goods and services during the most recent 12 months on record, ending in May, was just over $570 billion. That’s nearly 13.6 percent larger than in 2016.

That increase came despite a 6.6 percent one-month drop in May, to the lowest monthly deficit since October 2016, before Trump was elected. But this drop may well prove to be temporary, as it was driven by a surge in exports led by soybeans and commercial aircraft. Exporters may have been rushing to beat the punitive tariffs (import taxes) that China had promised to impose (and later did) in retaliation for Trump’s proposed taxes on what the U.S. buys from China.

China — The goods-and-services trade deficit with China grew at a similar clip, up by 12.9 percent between 2016 and the most recent 12 months on record, ending in March, when it hit $348 billion. (Country-by-country trade figures for goods and services are available only on a quarterly basis).

Since the period covered by those figures, Trump has initiated a full-scale trade conflict with China, threatening to impose taxes on practically everything the U.S. imports from China. The first tariffs took effect at 12:01 a.m. on July 6, prompting China to retaliate with increased tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. goods. There is as yet no negotiated solution in sight.

Mexico — Meanwhile, the much smaller trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico totaled nearly $70 billion the 12 months ending in March, an increase of 12.0 percent compared with 2016.

Trump’s negotiations to alter the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada were bogged down for all of 2017 and still have not resulted in a new agreement. And in the July 1 election, a populist, anti-Trump candidate was elected as Mexico’s new president in a landslide victory, further muddling the outlook for renegotiating the trade pact. Andrés Manuel López Obrador takes office Dec. 1.

Canada — Meanwhile, the trade surplus that the U.S. runs with Canada grew just a bit smaller under Trump. The trade balance was positive by nearly $6.9 billion during the 12 months ending in March — meaning that the U.S. sold that much more in goods and services to Canada than it bought from that country. That surplus is 6.9 percent smaller than it was in 2016.

Trump has a hard time with this. In March, he famously told a group of political donors that he told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that Trudeau was “wrong” to say the U.S. runs a surplus with Canada, even though U.S. government figures show it does. “I didn’t even know. … I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong,'” Trump said, according to audio of his remarks.

Health Insurance Coverage

The number of people lacking health insurance went up only somewhat, but millions are expected to drop or lose coverage next year and in subsequent years.

The most recent report from the National Health Interview Survey estimates that 29.3 million people were uninsured during 2017. That’s an increase of 700,000 people from 2016. But it’s still 19.3 million fewer than were uninsured in 2010, the year Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.

However, polling by the Gallup organization found a larger increase — estimating that 3.2 million Americans entered the ranks of the uninsured in 2017.

Trump failed to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act as he promised to do. But in December, he signed a tax bill that will end Obamacare’s tax penalty for people who fail to obtain coverage. At that point, Trump told reporters that “Obamacare is finished. It’s dead. It’s gone.” But that’s not so; the mandate penalty remains in effect until 2019.

Trump notwithstanding, the number of people signing up in December through the ACA exchanges for coverage in 2018 dropped only slightly, to 11.8 million. That’s down from 12.2 million in 2017 and 12.7 million in 2016, according to the government’s final enrollment report released April 3.

The big impact is expected later. According to an estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the end of the mandate penalty next year will cause 4 million people to lose or drop coverage in 2019, rising to 12 million two years later and 13 million in 2025.

CBO said that ending the mandate would cause average policy premiums for those buying individual policies to rise 10 percent in most years. “[H]ealthier people would be less likely to obtain insurance and … the resulting increases in premiums would cause more people to not purchase insurance,” CBO said.

Food Stamps

The number of food stamp recipients went down under Trump — even as he proposed to cut the program and to move it to a newly named “Department of Health and Public Welfare.”

As of April, the most recent month for which figures are available, 39.6 million people were receiving the aid, the lowest number since February 2010. The number has gone down nearly 3.1 million, or 7.2 percent, since January 2017, when Trump took office.

The number generally has been going down since peaking at nearly 47.8 million in December 2012, as the economy recovered from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. The numbers jumped up in August, September and October last year as part of the federal government’s disaster relief efforts following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and after wildfires in eight Western states. But that increase proved to be a temporary blip in the downward trend.

Judiciary Appointments

Trump is putting his mark on the federal appellate courts more quickly than Obama was able to do in his first months. But Obama won confirmation of more lower court judges.

Supreme Court — So far Trump has won Senate confirmation for one Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch. Obama also was able to fill one high court vacancy during his first year-and-a-half in office, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Trump now has an opportunity to fill a second vacancy on the high court. Justice Anthony Kennedy is retiring effective July 31, and Trump has announced his intent to nominate Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill that vacancy.

Should Kavanaugh win quick confirmation that would keep the score numerically even with Obama at two Supreme Court justices each. On Aug. 5 of Obama’s second year in office, 2010, the Senate approved his nomination of Elena Kagan to be a Supreme Court justice.

Court of Appeals — But Trump has won confirmation for 22 U.S. Court of Appeals judges, including the most recent one cleared by the Senate July 10. That total compares with only nine for Obama at the same point in his first term.

USA Today called his early success “perhaps Trump’s most significant achievement” to date. However, responsibility must be shared with the Republican leadership of the Senate, which not only refused to consider Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy eventually filled by Trump’s appointee Gorsuch, but also blocked confirmation of dozens of Obama’s nominees to lower courts as well. Trump inherited 17 Court of Appeals vacancies, for example, including seven that had Obama nominees pending and that expired at the time Trump took office.

District Court — On the other hand, only 20 of Trump’s nominees to be federal District Court judges have been confirmed, which is seven fewer than the 27 for whom Obama had won confirmation at the same point in his presidency.

Federal Debt and Deficits

Trump inherited rising federal debt and deficits, and his tax cut and spending increases are projected to make both rise faster.

The federal debt held by the public stood at nearly $15.5 trillion at the last count on July 9 — more than $1 trillion more than when he took office. That’s a 7.5 percent increase under Trump. And that figure will go up even faster in coming years unless Trump and Congress impose massive spending cuts, or reverse course and increase taxes.

The annual federal deficit for fiscal year 2017 (which ended Sept. 30 and was largely the result of spending and taxes set under Obama) was nearly $666 billion, up from just under $586 billion the year before.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had expected that deficit to drop a bit in the current year before resuming an indefinite upward path. But Trump’s cuts in corporate and individual income tax rates — as well as the bipartisan spending deal he signed Feb. 9 — stand to cause the red ink to gush even faster.

CBO now estimates that the deficit for the current fiscal year (ending Sept. 30) will rise to $804 billion, and continue rising for the foreseeable future, exceeding $1 trillion annually starting in FY2020. (Deficit projections are in Summary Table 2, page 4.) Further, CBO said June 29 that under current law, federal deficits will continue growing for the next 30 years, “reaching the highest level of debt relative to GDP in the nation’s history by far.” CBO projected debt would reach 152 percent of the nation’s total annual economic output by 2048 — up from 78 percent currently.

CBO’s projections take into account an increase in economic growth expected from Trump’s tax cuts. But the cuts fall well short of paying for themselves.

CBO projected that GDP would be 0.7 percent higher on average each year over the next 11 years as a result of the cuts. That’s enough to reduce the projected $2.3 trillion initial cost of the tax rate reductions (including both lost revenue and higher borrowing costs) by $461 billion — or about one-fifth. (See table B3.)

Oil Production and Imports

U.S. crude oil production resumed its upward trend under Trump, rising 10 percent during the most recent 12 months on record (ending in April), compared with all of 2016.

Domestic oil production has increased every year since 2008, except for a 5.6 percent drop in 2016 after prices plunged to below $30 a barrel, from more than $100 in 2014. The price returned to more than $50 a barrel by the end of 2016 and as high as $74 a barrel this year, prompting increased drilling and production.

As a result, the trend to reduce reliance on foreign oil also resumed. The U.S. imported only 15.5 percent of its oil and petroleum products during the first five months of 2018, down from 24.4 percent in all of 2016.

Dependence on imports peaked in 2005, when the U.S. imported 60.3 percent of its petroleum, and it has declined every year since except for 2016, when it ticked up by 0.3 percentage points.

If threatened tariffs are all imposed, after-tax income for households in the bottom and middle quintiles would fall by an additional 1.04 percent, higher than the average decrease of 0.92 percent.

Introduction

The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on steel, aluminum, washing machines, and thousands of other products that American businesses and consumers buy from China. Tariffs have been imposed as the result of various trade investigations that concluded injury to U.S. industries, national security threats, and unfair trade practices.[1] These tariffs will increase the tax burden on Americans, falling hardest on lower and middle-income households, and reduce economic output, employment, and wages.

Background

Tariffs are a type of excise tax An excise tax is a tax imposed on a specific good or activity. Excise taxes are commonly levied on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, soda, gasoline, insurance premiums, amusement activities, and betting, and typically make up a relatively small and volatile portion of state and local and, to a lesser extent, federal tax collections. that is levied on goods produced abroad at the time of import. They are intended to increase consumption of goods manufactured at home by increasing the price of foreign-produced goods.

Though tariffs may afford some short-term protection for domestic industries by shielding them from foreign competitors, they do so at the expense of others in the economy, including consumers and other industries, resulting in less economic output on net.

A recently published study which reviews tariff changes across 151 countries from 1963 to 2014 provides modern-day evidence of the negative effects of tariffs. The research finds that tariff increases lead to less output and productivity and more unemployment and inequality.[2] These negative effects are magnified when tariffs are increased during expansions and in advanced economies.[3]

Ultimately, tariffs result in net decreases in productivity, output, and income; consumers lose more than producers gain, resulting in a net loss to the economy.

Overview of Trump Administration Tariffs

The Trump administration has increased taxes on Americans by imposing nearly $42 billion worth of tariffs. These include the following:[4]

25 percent tariff on imported steel, which amounts to about a $7.3 billion tax increase.

10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, which amounts to a nearly $1.7 billion tax increase.

Doubled steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkey, which is a tax increase of roughly $0.34 billion.

25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of imports from China, which amounts to a $12.5 billion tax increase.

10 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of imports from China, which amounts to a $20 billion tax increase.

Tariffs on washing machines, which amount to about a $0.15 billion tax increase.[5]

The administration has also threatened to impose $129 billion in additional import duties, which would include new tariffs on automobiles and auto parts as well as escalated tariffs on imports from China.[6] These include:

25 percent tariff on Chapter 87 auto imports, which amounts to a roughly $73.1 billion tax increase.

25 percent tariff, up from the 10 percent tariff, on $200 billion worth of imports from China, which amounts to a tax increase of $30 billion.

10 percent tariff on approximately $267 billion of additional imports from China, which amounts to a $26.7 billion tax increase.

Economic Impact of Trump Administration Tariffs

The imposition of a tariff diverts resources away from more efficient producers to less efficient producers. Tariffs can raise the cost of parts and materials, which would raise the price of goods using those inputs and reduce private-sector output. Tariffs also result in consumers paying more for goods than they would have otherwise. Price increases such as these reduce the after-tax value of both labor and capital income; as tariffs reduce the return to labor and capital, they incentivize Americans to work and invest less, which leads to lower output.

According to the Tax Foundation model, the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce long-run GDP by 0.12 percent ($30.4 billion) and wages by 0.08 percent and eliminate 94,300 full-time equivalent jobs.

Table 1. Impact of Tariffs Imposed by the Trump Administration Source: Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model, April 2018 Tariff Revenue (billions $2018) $41.95 Long-run GDP -0.12% GDP (billions $2018) -$30.43 Wages -0.08% FTE Jobs -94,300

If the administration moves ahead with its threats to impose additional tariffs, long-run GDP would fall by 0.38 percent ($94.4 billion) and wages by 0.24 percent, and 292,600 full-time equivalent jobs would be eliminated. These losses would be in addition to those in Table 1.

Distributional Impact of Trump Administration Tariffs

The distributional effects of a tariff (the economic burden it places on households across income levels) tend to be regressive, burdening lower-income households more than higher-income households.

Tariffs are taken out of business revenue before it is distributed as compensation to factor inputs (workers and capital). This creates a wedge between what workers and capital produce and the amount they receive; in other words, a wedge between the consumer price and the producer price.

Tariffs ultimately fall on the factors of production and reduce taxpayer labor and capital income. This occurs either by raising prices or reducing wage and capital income. Tariffs tend to be regressive because the average shares of income sources burdened by tariffs are higher for lower-income taxpayers.[7]

Our estimates of the distributional impact of the Trump administration tariffs show that lower and middle-income households experience relatively larger drops in after-tax income.

So far in 2018, the Trump administration has imposed $42 billion worth of tariffs, which we estimate will reduce after-tax incomes by 0.30 percent on average. This negative effect is more pronounced, however, for households in the lowest and middle quintiles, reducing their after-tax incomes by 0.33 percent. This represents a decrease in after-tax income of $146 for taxpayers in the middle quintile (40% to 60%). The reduction for households in the top 1 percent income range is a smaller 0.23 percent.

If the administration further escalates by imposing the threatened tariffs of $129.8 billion, after-tax incomes would drop further, falling by 0.92 percent on average. Again, households in the lowest and middle quintiles would see a larger drop in their after-tax income, which would fall by 1.04 percent if the threatened tariffs were imposed. For households in the middle quintile (40% to 60%) this represents a decrease in after-tax income of $453.

Conclusion

The burden of higher tariffs will fall disproportionately harder on lower and middle-income households than on upper-income households. The administration has already imposed a $42 billion a year tax increase on Americans, which will reduce after-tax incomes by 0.33 percent on average. Acting on the threats to impose an additional $129.8 billion in annual tariffs would further reduce after-tax incomes, falling by an average of 0.92 percent.

Modeling Notes

The Tax Foundation modeled the impact of tariffs with our Taxes and Growth model.[8] In the Tax Foundation’s model, tariffs are treated as a targeted excise tax on the tradable sector which ultimately fall on U.S. labor or capital and result in lower output. To model the distributional impact, we passed the tax backwards as reductions in factor income, which reduced the returns to both labor and capital income. In modeling the tariffs, we did not account for the potential reaction of foreign countries, nor the additional losses in welfare from having taxes with uneven impacts across sectors, both of which could result in additional economic effects.

A closer look at the numbers, though, show that claim is questionable.

With just days left before a critical midterm election, Trump has been barnstorming the country in a series of rallies reminiscent of his 2016 presidential campaign. This time around, he is touting his record on the economy, claiming to have created more jobs and expanded economic growth at a pace that not seen by any of his predecessors in the White House.

""Nobody has ever been president that has the greatest economy in the history of our country,"" Trump told reporters at the White House Thursday. ""This is the greatest economy in the history of our country.""

Trump touted the latest sign of economic strength in Friday's employment report, which showed a net gain of 250,000 new jobs in October, and wage gains of 3.1 percent from a year ago. That boost in wages was the best since April 2009, when the U.S. was emerging from the Great Recession.

By any measure, those are good numbers. However, they're hardly the ""greatest"" in U.S. history.

A better way to compare Trump's record is to compare the overall gains in the economy since he took office with those of his predecessors, during the same period in their presidencies. When viewed in that light, Trump's record on most of those measures is decidedly average. Below are four data points that suggest Trump's claims just don't add up."
279,Why Trump appointed Kudlow to replace Cohn as economic adviser - NBC News,Why Trump appointed Kudlow to replace Cohn as economic adviser  NBC News,"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vjb25vbXkvd2h5LXRydW1wLW5vbWluYXRlZC1rdWRsb3ctcmVwbGFjZS1jb2huLWVjb25vbWljLWFkdmlzZXItbjg1NjY1MdIBK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL25jbmE4NTY2NTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"President Donald Trump's choice of Larry Kudlow to be his chief economic adviser might seem a bit of a head-scratcher at first.

Kudlow was chosen Wednesday to replace Gary Cohn, a free-trade advocate who led the internal opposition to Trump's tariff proposals on imported steel and aluminum. Kudlow, a CNBC senior contributor and on-air personality, has also been a staunch advocate of free trade and an opponent of tariffs. That threatens to create a conflict with Trump's protectionist views on day one.

But Trump says Kudlow now agrees that the threat of tariffs can be used as a bargaining chip to force all sides to the table.

""We don't agree on everything, but in this case I think that's good,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""I want to have different opinions. We agree on most. He now has come around to believing in tariffs as a negotiating point.""

While the president said he would welcome disagreement from Kudlow, other cabinet members with dissonant views from Trump have been shown the door. Trump fired Rex Tillerson as Secretary of state via tweet this week, just one day after Tillerson condemned Russia for its alleged involvement in the poisoning of a British spy. Trump also disposed of an undersecretary of state who had contradicted the White House's version of how the layoff occurred.

The new top economic adviser said Wednesday on CNBC he was ""honored to take the job"" and related the series of thirty minute phone calls he had over ""three to four days"" in advance of being offered the position.

""He was wonderful,"" said Kudlow, ""it was a terrific experience,"" and lauded Trump's handling of the economy. ""The economy is starting to boom, the tax cuts are working,"" and infrastructure development is in the wing, he said.

Kudlow also praised the president for his leadership.

""He's completely in command. Not only does he explain things he's thinking, he asks questions,"" said Kudlow. ""He's a smart man.

Kudlow may agree with Cohn's opposition to tariffs in principle, but the difference is that he's willing to get on board for the greater good. The nominee ""has been a spirited cheerleader for conservative, low-tax/supply-side fiscal policies, regardless of past experience or painful facts that stare the rest of us in the face,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.

In his early years Kudlow worked on Democratic campaigns and those of future conservatives. He worked as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and was part of the Reagan administration as an associate director in the Office of Management and Budget. Later he worked as an economic counselor and sat on the board of companies that advocated for lowering taxes and decreasing regulation.

""Since Kudlow has been critical on-air of the president’s decision to back trade tariffs, and on trade generally, the commentator and former Reagan administration staffer seems at odds with the rising influence of trade adviser Peter Navarro and the president's statements,"" said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst, in an email. While acknowledging the experience of the nominee for the top economic slot, Hamrick said that now the stakes are higher than what Kudlow has faced in the past.

""Unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here,"" said Hamrick."

I’ve made a fortune by using debt, and if things don’t work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that’s a smart thing, not a stupid thing.” Armed with this vast professional experience, Trump declared that as president he’d be better than anyone at fixing America’s debt and deficit problems, even insisting, incredibly, that over a period of eight years he would make America debt-free, a feat not accomplished since 1835. Of course, as everyone but the president seems to understand, screwing over your creditors isn’t something you can do as a head of state, nor is the United States government some seedy Atlantic City casino you can refinance—a fact that economists have been at pains to drive home since the president embarked on his massive spending spree.

“My view is that this fiscal expansion is probably the most foolhardy escapade in modern economic policy history,” Albert Edwards, a global strategist at Société Générale wrote in a report to clients on Wednesday. Noting that the timing of Trump’s giant fiscal stimulus was “utterly ridiculous” considering the strength of the economy, Edwards warned that Trump’s yuge tax cuts, plus a $300 billion spending package, plus a proposed $200 billion infrastructure plan “will only accelerate the collapse of U.S. financial markets as the Federal Reserve hikes rates even more quickly. . . . The post-mortem will identify President Trump’s ludicrously timed fiscal stimulus as a key trigger for the collapse.”

The ludicrous timing is the crux of the problem. As my colleague William D. Cohan notes, there’s only so much gasoline you can pour on a white-hot economy before it overheats. Last week’s market correction was primarily the result of fears that the Federal Reserve will respond to rising inflation by hiking interest rates and slamming the brakes on the whole shebang, kicking off a potential Twitter war between Trump and new Fed chair Jerome Powell in the process. That’s a dangerous position to be in when you’re already in a nearly decade-long expansion cycle. When the economy inevitably slows (which, memo to the president, is how business cycles tend to work), the debt problem gets even worse.

Even the ultra conservative Heritage Foundation is horrified by the pace at which Trump is spending money. “It fails as sound fiscal policy,” senior policy analyst Justin Bogie commented this week before reminding his audience that the guy who in their mind was Satan with a black card wouldn’t even be so rash. “This proposal would add an additional $7 trillion to the national debt,” he said, “something not even a big spender like President Obama ever proposed.” Panning the Trump University-level thinking at play, Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Ian Shepherdson added on Thursday that “This is the dumbest thing the U.S. could possibly do.”"
281,Has Donald Trump really made America (economically) great again? - NBC News,Has Donald Trump really made America (economically) great again?  NBC News,"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL3RoaW5rL29waW5pb24vaGFzLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1yZWFsbHktbWFkZS1hbWVyaWNhLWVjb25vbWljYWxseS1ncmVhdC1hZ2Fpbi1uY25hODg2MTYx0gEsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vdGhpbmsvYW1wL25jbmE4ODYxNjE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"As part of President Donald Trump’s apparent effort to be a two-termer, he uses any occasion to talk up the strong U.S. economy. For instance, last week at his Oval Office signing of an executive order ending the practice of separating undocumented immigrant families, the president assured the American people he was dealing with immigration ""just like we dealt with North Korea, we dealt with Iran, we dealt with an economy that was going in the wrong direction."" It's seemingly working: A new CNBC survey says that 51 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the economy.

One tiny problem: The economy was not “going in the wrong direction” when Trump was elected. It has been growing steadily, though unspectacularly, ever since the end of the Great Recession in summer 2009. What’s more, the economy has been adding jobs for a whopping 92 consecutive months, the longest streak on record.

So far, the Trump-era economy has statistically been merely an extension of the Obama-era economy: economic growth about the same (roughly 2 percent annually), and job growth about the same (just shy of 200,000 a month). Same-old, same-old — even though, during the 2016 campaign, Trump made a lot of wild promises about how his policies (from tax cuts to deregulation to trade) would supercharge economic growth like America has never seen before.

So far, the Trump-era economy has statistically been merely an extension of the Obama-era economy.

Still, Trump does finally have his own positive story to tell. A series of encouraging economic reports, such as retail sales, indicate that the economy is surging. The megabank JPMorgan, for example, now estimates the nation’s gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, is expanding at a “boomy” 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, almost twice the 2.2 percent growth rate experienced in the first three months of the year. And fellow Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs isn’t far behind with a 3.9 percent forecast. What’s more, some optimists think the current 4.7 percent GDPNow forecast from the Atlanta Fed is a better estimate of how things are shaping up.

Now, most experts — whether on Wall Street or in Washington — don’t think growth as fast as that is sustainable; most are predicting the U.S. could see a couple years of 3 percent growth. That’s still pretty peppy, and something that hasn’t happened in over a decade. Even better, we might finally be on the verge of seeing higher wages from both the faster GDP growth and the continuing fall in unemployment, now at decades' lows.

Trump fans are, obviously, touting this good news as proof that Trumponomics works, especially compared to Obamanomics; all the liberal and mainstream media naysayers who predicted the tax cuts would fail were wrong, they say. In not even a half term, in their minds, Trump has already made America pretty darn great again — at least as measured by economic stats.

The economic surge is an expected side effect of more than just tax cuts.

Yet that’s not quite right: The economic surge is an expected side effect of more than just tax cuts. Many economists had been predicting the big tax cuts (about $150 billion a year) combined with increased government spending (about $300 billion over the next few years) would boost growth, at least for a while. As the Congressional Budget Office explained in its recent forecast, “because the tax cuts boost after-tax incomes, they, along with the increases in federal spending, are expected to add excess demand in the next few years.”

And, not only is the surge no surprise, but the credit goes to both parties. While Democrats wanted no part of the tax cuts, the increased spending was a bipartisan affair.

But here’s the really weird thing: Republicans have traditionally touted tax cuts as a way to boost long-term growth by enhancing incentives to work, save and invest. This sort of juicing of the economy with tax cuts and spending increases is what Republicans used to dismiss as “sugar high” economics as recently as when Obama and the Democrats passed their big trillion-dollar tax and spending stimulus back in 2009. Nothing but a temporary boost that doesn't really alter the economy’s deep fundamentals, they called it.

Trump might be helping make America great again, but only for a little while.

And all those currently rosy forecasts show the Trump-led growth surge fading by 2020 or so (possibly just in time for the re-election campaign) and the economy returning to its boring 2 percent growth baseline. One reason for this is that the tax cuts and higher spending are generating massive, trillion-dollar budget deficits as far as the eye can see, which could hurt growth by crowding out private investment. (The importance of minding budget deficits are another issue on which the GOP has flipped since the Obama years.) So Trump might be helping make America great again, but only for a little while.

Nothing, of course, is set in stone. One sign that the effects of Trump’s economic policies could outlast his first term would be an increase in productivity growth, or output per worker. If each worker produces more — whether from better training, better equipment or doing their job differently — higher wages should follow.

But productivity growth has been moribund for more than a decade. Moreover, there’s little evidence yet that anything Trump is doing has helped much. And if even productivity does boom, as it did during the mid-1990s through early 2000s, it could be the result of everything that’s been happening for years in Silicon Valley, such as advances in artificial intelligence, rather than what Washington’s been doing more recently.

Meanwhile, it could take years before economists are able to tease out any significant growth impacts from cutting business taxes or deregulation. In economic projections, there are no guarantees — other than Trump will surely try to take credit."

A year after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, he continues to receive historically low and highly partisan approval ratings, despite widely positive views of the economy. He gets at least some credit for the economy, but most Americans don't feel they've personally benefitted from his policies – only 22 percent think they've been directly helped.

As he prepares to give his first State of the Union address, thirty-seven percent of Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president. He has lower ratings at the one-year mark than past presidents -- 58 percent now disapprove.

Americans overall are feeling upbeat about the economy and the President gets some credit for that. Sixty-seven percent say the economy is very or fair good – a figure that has been at the 60 percent level or higher since Mr. Trump became president. Even half of Democrats give him at least some credit.

But most Americans don't feel they have benefited directly from the president's policies. Feelings on this are largely driven by partisanship. Also, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say they have been hurt by his policies.

In the history of CBS News polling, Trump's approval rating has varied the least of any president during a first year going back to Ronald Reagan, when the poll began routinely tracking job approval. The partisan splits have proved as durable as they are wide.

President Trump's first approval rating of his presidency was 40 percent, which ticked up to 43 percent in April after the U.S. launched airstrikes against Syrian military targets. That was his highest approval to date. In September, Mr. Trump got his lowest approval rating of this first year, at 35 percent.

The percentage of Americans who disapprove of Mr. Trump's job performance has risen ten points since February of last year, suggesting that many who were undecided at the start of his presidency now disapprove of him.

President Trump's ratings are low among most demographic groups, with majorities of both men and women, and most Americans of all racial backgrounds and age groups disapproving. Only a majority of Republicans, conservatives, and white evangelicals approve. Whites without a college degree – whose votes helped Mr. Trump win the presidency - are divided today.

Going in, Americans had largely negative expectations about the kind of President Donald Trump would be, and their assessments are now even more negative. Last year, one third of Americans expected Trump to be a ""Poor"" president, and 53 percent give him a grade of ""Poor"" today.

It's largely Democrats who have become more negative about the Trump presidency. Republicans are mostly positive about the president's first year: Eight in 10 Republicans approve of the job Donald Trump is doing and most are just as optimistic with him in office now as they were right before he was sworn in as president. Seven in 10 say he has been a very good or good president.

During the campaign, candidate Trump said he would help America win again. Right now, more than half of Americans (55 percent) feel America is losing at the things it tries to do. Three in four Republicans see a country that is winning, but most Democrats and independents do not.

On specific issues, Trump is relatively strongest on the economy (46 percent) and terrorism (45 percent). He gets lower marks on tax policy (38 percent), immigration (34 percent) and the situation with North Korea (34 percent). Most Republicans approve of his handling of these issues, while most Democrats don't.

Republicans feel Trump has made more progress on some of his campaign promises than others. At least four in 10 see a lot of progress on bringing jobs back to the U.S., cutting taxes for the middle class, defeating ISIS, and reducing regulations on business. Fewer Republicans see a lot of progress on repealing Obamacare and only one in 10 think Trump has made a lot of progress in building a border wall.

Overall, there are dramatic partisan splits on just about every measure, including both the President and the direction of the country overall.

This poll was conducted by telephone January 13-16, 2018 among a random sample of 1,225 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.

The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.

Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.

The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

In the time Donald Trump has been in the White House:

The jobless rate dropped to the lowest in nearly half a century, and the number of unfilled job openings hit a record high.

Economic growth spurted to a 4.2 percent annual rate in the most recent quarter.

Median household income rose to the highest level ever recorded in 2017. Poverty declined.

The growth of federal regulations slowed, and has lately reversed.

Crime rates declined. The number of homicides went down 0.7 percent last year after rising for the previous two years.

Carbon emissions rose. Coal mining jobs went up a bit.

Corporate profits, stock prices and home values set record highs.

The trade deficit grew larger.

The federal debt increased by nearly $1.4 trillion, more than 9 percent. Yearly deficits increased.

The U.S. image abroad plunged.

Analysis

This is our third quarterly update of the “Trump’s Numbers” scorecard that we posted in January and updated for the first time on April 16 and again on July 11. We’ll publish additional updates every three months, as fresh statistics become available.

As always, starting when we posted our first “Obama’s Numbers” article six years ago — and in the quarterly updates and final summary that followed — we’ve included statistics that may seem good or bad or just neutral, depending on the reader’s point of view.

This update includes the first comprehensive looks at crime, income and poverty during the president’s first year in office. The FBI’s report of crime rates for all of 2017 was released Sept. 24, and the Census Bureau’s figures for median annual household income and poverty levels during 2017 were released Sept 12. Other statistics are released quarterly, monthly and sometimes daily, and we include here the most recent available as of this date.

We make no judgment as to how much credit or blame any president deserves for things that happen during his time in office. Opinions differ on that.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed a bit under Trump, but unemployment dropped to the lowest point in nearly half a century.

Employment — Total nonfarm employment grew by 3.8 million during the president’s first 20 months in office, according to the most recent figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That continued an unbroken chain of monthly gains in total employment that started nearly eight years earlier, in October 2010.

The average monthly gain under Trump is 190,000 jobs, which is 12 percent below the average monthly gain of 217,000 during Obama’s second term.

Trump will have to pick up the pace if he is to fulfill his campaign boast that he will be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.”

Unemployment — One reason for the slowdown in job growth: fewer job-seekers. The unemployment rate — which was well below the historical norm when Trump took office — has continued to fall a full 1.1 percentage point lower.

The rate was 4.8 percent when he was sworn in, and fell to 3.7 percent in September. The last time it was that low was October of 1969 — nearly 49 years earlier.

The historical norm is 5.6 percent, which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948. The lowest unemployment rate ever recorded was in 1953, when the rate was 2.5 percent for a couple of months.

Job Openings — Another reason employment growth has slowed is a worsening shortage of qualified workers. The number of unfilled job openings hit a new record of more than 6.9 million as of the last business day in July — the most in the 18 years the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking them.

That’s a gain of nearly 1.5 million unfilled job openings — or 27.5 percent — since Trump took office.

Labor Force Participation — Despite the abundance of jobs, the labor force participation rate — which went down 2.8 percentage points during the Obama years — has slipped a bit more under Trump.

Republicans often criticized Obama for the decline during his time, even though it was due mostly to the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age, and other demographic factors beyond the control of any president. The rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks.

Since Trump took office, the rate has fluctuated in a narrow range between 63.0 percent and 62.7 percent. It was 62.7 percent in August, 0.2 percentage points below where it was the month Trump took office.

Manufacturing Jobs — Manufacturing jobs increased under Trump, even faster than total employment.

The number rose by 378,000 between Trump’s inauguration and September. That followed a net decrease of 192,000 under Obama.

The increase under Trump amounts to 3.1 percent, compared with the 2.6 percent increase in overall employment. The number of manufacturing jobs is still nearly 1 million below where it was in December 2007, at the start of the Great Recession.

Economic Growth

The economy is growing faster under Trump — spurting to a yearly rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018, the most recent official estimate available.

That’s up from the 2.2 percent increase during his first year, followed by a 2.2 percent yearly rate in the first quarter of 2018, according to the most recent estimate of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s the “real” rate of growth in gross domestic product after accounting for price inflation.

The 4.2 percent rate is just within the 4 percent to 6 percent rate Trump promised repeatedly, both when he was a candidate and also as president.

The “GDP Now” forecast produced by the Federal Reserve Board of Atlanta projects that the third-quarter growth rate continued at a 4.2 percent annual rate. The official estimate for the third quarter of 2018 won’t be released until Oct. 26.

Most economists believe the current growth spurt is temporary. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued an updated economic forecast Aug. 13 projecting real GDP to grow 3.1 percent this year, and 2.4 percent in 2019. That’s in line with the most recent median forecast of the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents (issued Sept. 26), which is for 3.1 percent growth in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020.

Other leading economists tend to agree. Of the business and university economists who offered an annual GDP forecast to the Wall Street Journal‘s monthly economic survey in October, the average prediction was for 3.1 percent growth this year and 2.4 percent next year. Similarly, the National Association of Business Economists’ October survey produced a median forecast of 3.1 percent growth this year and 2.5 percent next year.

Technical Note: Historical GDP figures given here are slightly different from those given in earlier “Numbers” articles, because on July 27 the Bureau of Economic Analysis issued its 15th “comprehensive update” of GDP figures, something it does roughly every five years in an effort to improve the quality of its economic measurement. In this case, some figures were revised slightly all the way back to 1929. The new BEA estimate of GDP growth for the 10 years ending last year has increased by an average of 0.1 percent.

Income and Poverty

Household Income — Household income hit another record during Trump’s first year — but it’s a record with an asterisk.

The Census Bureau’s measure of median household income reached $61,372 in 2017. After adjusting for inflation, that was an increase of $1,063 from the previous record level reached in Obama’s final year, when the median income finally reached and exceeded a level last seen in 1999. (The median figure represents the midpoint — half of all households earned more, half less.)

In percentage terms, the increase in 2017 was 1.8 percent, following a 3.1 percent increase in 2016.

However, a senior Census official cautioned that the latest “records” in 2016 and 2017 are due in part to a change in the survey questions in 2014. Starting then, the annual survey has picked up some sources of income that were previously missed. Taking this into account, Jonathan L. Rothbaum, chief of the Income Statistics Branch, said the 2017 median income would be in a “statistical tie” with incomes measured in 2007 and 1999.

Poverty — As incomes rose, the rate of poverty declined. The percentage of Americans living with income below the official poverty line went down to 12.3 percent of the population in 2017, the lowest level since 2006, just before the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

The poverty rate has now declined for three consecutive years, dropping by 1.3 percentage points in 2015, by 0.8 points in 2016 and by 0.4 points in Trump’s first year.

Regulations

The growth of federal regulation didn’t come to the “sudden, screeching and beautiful halt” Trump once claimed, but it does seem to have ground slowly to a stop over many months — and in recent months has reversed.

The number of restrictive words and phrases (such as “shall,” “prohibited” or “may not”) contained in the Code of Federal Regulations went up by 0.73 percent during Trump’s first 15 months, reaching a peak of nearly 1.09 million on April 6, according to daily tracking done by the QuantGov project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.

But since that April peak, the number has declined by a little over one-quarter of 1 percent as of Oct. 10. That decline has grown a bit larger since our last report, suggesting that it may be the start of a trend, and not just a temporary blip.

Overall, the drop still leaves a nearly 0.5 percent net increase in restrictive words and phrases in the nearly 20 months since Trump took office — a far slower rate of rise than in the past. The average annual growth during both the Obama years and the George W. Bush years was just under 1.5 percent, according to annual QuantGov tracking.

The Mercatus Center database provides a hard count of specific legal mandates and prohibitions imposed by federal regulators that we find to be more relevant than counts of the number of pages or words in the rulebook. It doesn’t attempt to assess the cost or benefit of any particular rule — such assessments require a degree of guesswork and are sensitive to assumptions. But it does track the sheer volume of federal rules with more precision than we have found in other metrics.

Some of the rules Trump has eliminated are quite significant. Within a month of taking office, for example, Trump signed a law nullifying an Obama-era rule prohibiting coal mining companies from dumping waste into streams and waterways. And on April 13 his administration withdrew Obama’s edict requiring automakers to double the fuel efficiency of new autos and light trucks to 50 miles per gallon by the year 2025. Instead, the requirement will be capped at 37 mpg starting in 2020.

Crime

Crime declined a bit in Trump’s first year, except for rapes, assaults and motor vehicle thefts, which increased.

The number of homicides declined by 0.7 percent in 2017, according to the FBI’s annual Crime in the United States report, after rising for the previous two years.

The number of all violent crimes went down by 0.2 percent. That included a 2.5 percent increase in rapes and a 1 percent increase in assaults, offset by a 4 percent decrease in robberies and the drop in homicides.

The number of property crimes went down 3 percent in 2017, including a 7.6 percent drop in burglaries and a 2.2 percent decrease in larcenies (such as shoplifting), but the number of motor vehicle thefts increased slightly, by 0.8 percent.

And early data suggests that crime rates are declining further this year. The Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law projects that the murder rate in the 30 largest U.S. cities will go down another 7.6 percent this year, based on preliminary data from 29 of those cities.

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly claimed that the murder rate was “the highest it’s been in 45 years.” That was wildly untrue. In fact, the murder rate had dropped to the lowest on record in 2014 — 4.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. And while it did rise for the next two years, it was still only 5.4 per 100,000 in 2016, just where it had been the year before Obama took office, and far below the peak rate of 10.2 reached in 1980.

In Trump’s first year, the murder rate dropped down a notch to 5.3 per 100,000 population — still higher than in each of the first seven years under Obama.

Coal and Environment

Coal Mining Jobs — As a candidate, Trump promised to “put our [coal] miners back to work,” but so far not many have regained their jobs.

A total of 35,700 coal mining jobs disappeared during the Obama years, but as of September, only 1,900 of them had come back under Trump, according to BLS figures. That’s 5.3 percent of the coal mining jobs lost during the Obama years.

The outlook for coal miners remains bleak. The Energy Information Administration currently projects that U.S. coal production will decline 2 percent this year, and by another 2 percent in 2019. EIA expects there will be less demand for exports, and increased use of natural gas to generate electricity.

Carbon Emissions — Carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption have started edging up under Trump, after falling for years under Obama.

Revised figures from the Energy Information Administration show CO2 emissions at first fell by 0.8 percent in 2017, less than the 1.6 percent decline in Obama’s final year. They fell by a total of 14.3 percent between 2007 and 2017, due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal-fired plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, as well as solar and wind power.

But that downward trend that slowed sharply in Trump’s first year has now reversed entirely. Emissions during the most recent 12 months on record, ending in June 2018, were 0.8 percent higher than in all of 2016.

And the rise is expected to continue. EIA predicted in October that CO2 emissions will increase by 2.2 percent for all of 2018, compared with 2017. “This increase largely reflects higher natural gas consumption because of a colder winter and a warmer summer than in 2017,” EIA said. These projections are sensitive to changes in weather, economic growth and energy prices — all difficult to forecast.

Border Security

Illegal border crossings declined under Trump, dropping sharply at first but lately rising again to nearly where they were the year before he took office.

The number of people caught while illegally trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico each month plunged to a low of 11,127 in April of last year, according to figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But since then, the number has more than tripled, hitting 37,544 in August, the most recent month on record.

So far in 2018, the monthly average is 33,942, which is just 8 percent below the monthly average of 36,912 in 2016.

Corporate Profits

After-tax corporate profits are running at a record level under Trump. During the second quarter of 2018, they hit an annual rate of $1.96 trillion, the best quarter ever recorded. The current rate is 13 percent higher than the full year figure for 2016.

These annual and quarterly estimates originate with the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see line 45).

In our July update, we reported that full-year profits also set a record in 2017, but that’s no longer the case. After we posted that update, BEA on July 27 revised its GDP figures (of which corporate profits are one element) going back to 1929. As currently estimated, the $1.83 trillion in profits in 2017 was an increase of 5.4 percent over 2016, but still just shy of the $1.86 trillion now recorded for 2014 — the current full-year record.

After-tax profits are getting a boost this year from the tax cut Trump signed into law Dec. 22, dropping the top federal tax rate on corporate income to 21 percent, from 35 percent.

Stock Market

Stock prices continued their long rise under Trump, setting record after record — only to see much of the gain erased in a huge two-day sell-off just before we posted this article.

Despite the recent market tumble, at the close on Oct. 11 the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average was 20.5 percent higher than it was on the last trading day before Trump’s inauguration, and only 6.7 percent below the most recent record high set on Oct. 3.

Other indexes rose even more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up nearly 27 percent under Trump. And the NASDAQ Composite index, made up of more than 3,000 companies, was 32 percent higher than before Trump took office.

The bull market that began in 2009, at the depths of the Great Recession, passed its ninth anniversary in March and on Aug. 22 was widely proclaimed to be the longest-running bull market in modern financial history. By this common measure (with which some quibble), it would require a 20 percent drop from the Oct. 3 high to end the historic bull run and qualify as a new bear market.

Wages and Inflation

The upward trend in real wages continued under Trump, even as prices rose a bit faster.

CPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 3.3 percent during Trump’s first 20 months (through September of this year), continuing a long period of historically low inflation.

In the most recent 12-month period, the CPI rose 2.3 percent. The CPI rose an average of 1.8 percent each year of the Obama presidency (measured as the 12-month change ending each January), and an average of 2.4 percent during each of George W. Bush’s years.

Wages — Wage increases continued to outpace inflation, and so the purchasing power of weekly paychecks rose. The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 1.8 percent during Trump’s first 20 months, after going up 4.0 percent during Obama’s eight years.

Those figures are for all private-sector workers, including managers and supervisors.

For rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers (who make up 82 percent of all private-sector workers), real weekly earnings have gone up 1.6 percent so far under Trump, after rising 3.7 percent during Obama’s eight years.

Consumer Sentiment

Consumer confidence in the economy soared after Trump’s election, to the highest it has been in over a decade.

The University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers reported that its Index of Consumer Sentiment hit 101.4 in March, the highest since January 2004, a month marked by general euphoria following the capture of Saddam Hussein.

A separate survey of consumer confidence, conducted for the Conference Board, reached what it said was an 18-year high in September. (The Conference Board’s historical figures are proprietary, and not publicly available.)

The Michigan survey’s confidence figure has remained high, and most recently was 100.1 in September, topping 100 for yet a third time since 2004. The highest point between Obama’s inauguration and Trump’s election was 98.1 in January 2015.

The Michigan survey’s chief economist, Richard Curtin, said the latest results indicate the economy “has now benefited nearly all population subgroups,” adding: “Consumers anticipated continued growth in the economy and expected the unemployment rate to continue to slowly decline during the year ahead.”

Home Prices and Ownership

Home Prices — Home prices soared to record levels under Trump.

The most recent sales figures from the National Association of Realtors show the national median price of an existing, single-family home sold in August was $267,300. Earlier, in June, the average price hit $276,500 — the highest ever recorded — but prices fell back a bit in July and August. .

The August average is still $38,600 higher than the median price of $228,700 for homes sold during the month Trump took office — a gain in value of 16.9 percent. The rise in the Consumer Price Index during the same period was 3.2 percent.

The Realtors figures reflect raw sales prices without attempting to adjust for such factors as variations in the size, location, age or condition of the homes sold in a given month or year. Even so, a similar pattern emerges from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which compares sales prices of similar homes and seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing single-family housing stock.

The Case-Shiller index for July sales also was a record high, and was 11.1 percent higher than where it stood in the month Trump took office.

Whichever way you measure it, homeowners have seen the value of their houses rise dramatically since Trump took office.

Homeownership — Meanwhile, the percentage of Americans who own their homes has continued to recover from a years-long slide, gaining 0.6 percentage points since Trump took office.

The homeownership rate began to slide in 2004 after peaking at 69.2 percent of households for two quarters. It hit bottom in the second quarter of 2016 at 62.9 percent — the lowest point in more than half a century, and tied for the lowest on record.

The rate recovered 0.8 points before Trump took office, and has gone up another 0.6 points since then, reaching 64.3 percent in the second quarter of 2018, according to the most recent Census Bureau figures.

Trade

The trade deficit that Trump promised to reduce grew larger instead.

The most recent government figures show that the total U.S. trade deficit in goods and services during the most recent 12 months on record, ending in August, was $583 billion. That’s 16.2 percent larger than in 2016.

That increase came despite a 6.6 percent one-month drop in May, to the lowest monthly deficit since October 2016, before Trump was elected. But this drop proved to be temporary, as it was driven by a surge in exports led by soybeans and commercial aircraft. Exporters rushed to beat the punitive tariffs (import taxes) that China had promised to impose (and later did) in retaliation for Trump’s proposed taxes on what the U.S. buys from China.

China — The goods-and-services trade deficit with China grew at a similar clip, up by 13.7 percent between 2016 and the most recent 12 months on record, ending in June, when it hit nearly $351 billion. (Country-by-country trade figures for goods and services are available only on a quarterly basis.)

Trump has initiated a full-scale trade conflict with China, threatening to impose taxes on practically everything the U.S. imports from China. The first tariffs took effect at 12:01 a.m. on July 6, prompting China to retaliate with increased tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. goods. There is as yet no negotiated solution in sight. But on Oct. 11, news reports said Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, had agreed to meet personally in November to discuss a way forward.

Asked if his tariffs are working, Trump said on Sept. 18, “Well, we just started,” adding: “[T]his is a process. It takes a little time. ”

Mexico — Meanwhile, the much smaller trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico totaled nearly $70 billion during the 12 months ending in June, an increase of 11.9 percent compared with 2016.

Canada — The trade surplus that the U.S. runs with Canada grew just a bit smaller under Trump. The trade balance was positive by $6.5 billion during the 12 months ending in June — meaning that the U.S. sold that much more in goods and services to Canada than it bought from that country. That surplus is 11.8 percent smaller than it was in 2016.

On Aug. 27 the president announced he had reached a tentative new trade agreement with Mexico, and on Oct. 1, he announced that Canada had joined. Renegotiating the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement had been a key campaign promise. The new agreement will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. It is expected to be signed by leaders of the three countries within 60 days, but requires approval by Congress before it can take effect.

Health Insurance Coverage

The number of people lacking health insurance has barely changed under Trump, but millions are expected to drop or lose coverage next year and in subsequent years.

The most recent report from the National Health Interview Survey estimates that 28.3 million people were uninsured during the first three months of 2018, about 300,000 fewer than in 2016. Only 8.8 percent of the population lacked health coverage during that time, down from 9.0 percent during Obama’s last year.

That’s a reversal of the trend in Trump’s first year, when the number who lacked coverage rose by 700,000, according to the NHIC, and by 491,000, according to recently released Census figures. Both NHIC and Census said the increase measured in 2017 was not statistically significant.

Census and NHIC use slightly different definitions and methods to measure the uninsured. We feature the NHIC figures because they are released every three months, and are thus more timely than the annual Census tally.

Trump failed to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act as he promised to do. But in December, he signed a tax bill that will end Obamacare’s tax penalty for people who fail to obtain coverage. At that point, Trump told reporters that “Obamacare is finished. It’s dead. It’s gone.” But that’s not so; the mandate penalty remains in effect until 2019, and the sale of subsidized insurance on Healthcare.gov and state exchanges remains indefinitely.

So the big impact is expected later. According to an estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the end of the mandate penalty next year will cause 4 million people to lose or drop coverage in 2019, rising to 12 million two years later and 13 million in 2025.

CBO said that ending the mandate would cause average policy premiums for those buying individual policies to rise 10 percent in most years. “[H]ealthier people would be less likely to obtain insurance and … the resulting increases in premiums would cause more people to not purchase insurance,” CBO said.

Food Stamps

The number of food stamp recipients went down under Trump — even as he proposed to cut the program and to move it to a newly named “Department of Health and Public Welfare.”

As of July, the most recent month for which figures are available, 38.9 million people were receiving the aid, the lowest number since November 2009. The number has gone down nearly 3.8 million, or 8.8 percent, since January 2017, when Trump took office.

The number generally has been going down since peaking at nearly 47.8 million in December 2012, as the economy recovered from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. The numbers jumped up in August, September and October last year as part of the federal government’s disaster relief efforts following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and after wildfires in eight Western states. But that increase proved to be a temporary blip in the downward trend.

Judiciary Appointments

Trump is putting his mark on the federal courts — from top to bottom — more quickly than Obama was able to do in his first two years.

Supreme Court — So far Trump has won Senate confirmation for two Supreme Court nominees, Justice Neil Gorsuch and, on Oct. 6, Brett M. Kavanaugh. Obama also was able to fill two high court vacancies during his first two years in office, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

But the Kavanaugh nomination to fill the vacancy created by Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement is significant because Justice Kavanaugh may move the court to the right. He is considered more conservative than Kennedy, who sometimes sided with the liberal justices to provide deciding votes on issues including gay rights, abortion, capital punishment and affirmative action.

Court of Appeals — Trump also has won confirmation for 26 U.S. Court of Appeals judges. That total compares with only 11 for Obama at the same point in his first term.

District Court — Trump also has won confirmation for 41 of his nominees to be federal District Court judges, exceeding the 30 for whom Obama had won confirmation at the same point in his presidency.

Even before Kavanaugh’s confirmation, USA Today called this early success in winning judicial confirmations “perhaps Trump’s most significant achievement” to date. However, responsibility must be shared with the Republican leadership of the Senate, which not only refused to consider Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy eventually filled by Trump’s appointee Gorsuch, but also blocked confirmation of dozens of Obama’s nominees to lower courts. Trump inherited 17 Court of Appeals vacancies, for example, including seven that had Obama nominees pending and that expired at the time Trump took office.

Federal Debt and Deficits

Trump inherited rising federal debt and deficits, and his tax cut and spending increases are making both rise faster.

The federal debt held by the public stood at nearly $15.8 trillion at the last count on Oct. 10 — nearly $1.4 trillion higher than when he took office. That’s a 9.4 percent increase under Trump. And that figure will go up even more quickly in coming years unless Trump and Congress impose massive spending cuts, or reverse course and increase taxes.

The annual federal deficit for fiscal year 2017 (which was largely the result of spending and taxes set under Obama) was nearly $666 billion, up from just under $586 billion the year before.

And now Trump’s cuts in corporate and individual income tax rates — as well as the bipartisan spending deal he signed Feb. 9 — are causing the red ink to gush even faster than it did before. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects the deficit for fiscal year 2018, which ended Sept. 30, will be around $782 billion when the Treasury Department completes its final tabulation. That’s an increase of $116 billion from the previous fiscal year. Corporate income tax receipts alone fell by $92 billion, CBO estimated.

CBO now estimates that the deficit will continue rising for the foreseeable future, exceeding $1 trillion annually starting in FY2020. (Baseline deficit projections are in Table 1, page 2.) Further, CBO said on June 29 that under current law, federal deficits will continue growing for the next 30 years, “reaching the highest level of debt relative to GDP in the nation’s history by far.” CBO projected that under current law, debt would reach 152 percent of the nation’s total annual economic output by 2048 — up from 78 percent currently.

Oil Production and Imports

U.S. crude oil production resumed its upward trend under Trump, rising 14.7 percent during the most recent 12 months on record (ending in July), compared with all of 2016.

Domestic oil production has increased every year since 2008, except for a 6.1 percent drop in 2016 after prices plunged to below $30 a barrel, from more than $100 in 2014. The price returned to more than $50 a barrel by the end of 2016 and has hovered around $70 for many weeks, prompting increased drilling and production.

As a result, the trend to reduce reliance on foreign oil also resumed. The U.S. imported only 15 percent of its oil and petroleum products during the first eight months of 2018, down from 24.4 percent in all of 2016.

Dependence on imports peaked in 2005, when the U.S. imported 60.3 percent of its petroleum, and it has declined every year since except for 2016, when it ticked up by 0.3 percentage points.

U.S. Image Abroad

The U.S. image abroad continues to suffer under Trump.

Polling this year in 25 countries by the Pew Research Center shows those saying they have a favorable view of the United States is down in country after country, compared with the end of the Obama presidency.

Not surprisingly, one of the worst declines is among Mexicans, whom Trump said he would bill for his promised border wall. Only 32 percent of Mexicans now view the U.S. favorably, down by a full 34 percentage points under Trump. (See table on page 18.)

To the north, only 39 percent of Canadians view the U.S. favorably, down 26 percentage points. Among NATO allies, the U.S. favorability rating dropped 27 points among Germans, to 30 percent. It is down 25 points among the French, to 38 percent, is down 31 percent among the Dutch, to 34 percent, and is down 11 points among the British, only half of whom now view the U.S. favorably.

Sixty-seven percent of Japanese still view the U.S. favorably, but even that figure is down 5 points from where it was under Obama. And 83 percent of Israelis still view the U.S. favorably, up 2 points from the end of Obama’s time.

The only big improvement was among Russians, but even that gain is fading. Last year, Pew’s polling found 41 percent of Russians viewed the U.S. favorably, an increase of 26 points in Trump’s first year. But a year later, Pew’s polling now shows only 26 percent of Russians view the U.S. favorably — the lowest of all 25 countries surveyed — a gain of only 11 points.

290,How Long-Term Economic Distress Motivated Trump Voters - The Intercept,How Long-Term Economic Distress Motivated Trump Voters  The Intercept,"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDE4LzEwLzMxL2RvbmFsZC10cnVtcC0yMDE2LWVsZWN0aW9uLWVjb25vbWljLWRpc3RyZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Intercept,"It was this very week two years ago, just days before Election Day, that a sudden wave of campaign spending was unleashed in the presidential election, with Super PACs flooding the Rust Belt states with brand-new advertisements designed to stir anger at the Democratic ticket.

Much of the late-election spending centered on classic economic populist concerns: rising health care costs and the pervasive feeling that insider politicians are out to serve themselves, not the average American. The insidious, billionaire-backed push helped lock up the election for Donald Trump, who swept Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania to win an electoral college victory.

But what really motivated voters in those states? It’s a puzzle that has roiled political observers. The question continues to cast a shadow over how the Democratic Party should reimagine itself and appeal to voters going into future elections.

A new research paper from the Institute for New Economic Thinking released today makes the case that Trump artfully exploited long-term economic distress to clinch the 2016 presidential election.

The paper challenges the popular conventional wisdom embraced by many pundits that the 62.9 million Americans who cast a vote for Trump were simply one-dimensional “deplorables” — troglodytes motivated narrowly by racist, sexist, and xenophobic rhetoric and little else.

A More Complex Picture

The authors of this new study — Thomas Ferguson, Benjamin Page, Jacob Rothschild, Arturo Chang, and Jie Chen — use a combination of figures from the American National Election Studies data set, along with aggregate data from congressional districts, to paint a far more complicated picture.

Trump eschewed traditional Republican orthodoxy, promising to protect Medicare and Social Security, while training his fire at the bipartisan consensus around free trade. Many voters conflate trade deals that have hollowed out the country’s manufacturing base and decades of stagnant wages with increased immigration, seeing the issues as inextricably linked. Trump spoke to this view, blaming immigrants and refugees for crime and terrorism, but also for economic hardship and national decline, a message that appeared to resonate with voters.

“Not only were several major economic factors important; our analyses make clear that the social and the economic were intertwined, both in Trump’s rhetoric and in the minds of many voters,” the study notes.

The study is careful not to claim that race and gender played no role in the election, and notes that Trump absolutely mobilized anger over identity, gender, religion, and national origin. But the effects were limited. Explicit gender and ethnic insults used by Trump appeared to help the real estate tycoon prevail largely in the primary election but may have harmed him among many swing voters in the general election.

Previous attempts to use ANES data to discern the connection between economic anxiety and Trump support have found little correlation.

Previous papers rely almost entirely on ANES’s short-term economic attitude questions, which the authors argue are “known to be error-ridden, subject to partisan and other biases.” What’s more, these questions only provide a limited range of fill-in-the-bubble answers that do not reflect the full range of sometimes conflicting views of voters.

The authors of the Institute for New Economic Thinking study incorporate open-ended responses to ANES questions, which allow voters to write out their own spontaneous responses to broad questions, rather than selecting a canned response.

The open-ended answers, they argue, show that social and economic factors were deeply connected for many voters, including crucial voters who swung from voting for Barack Obama to Trump, voters who went from supporting Obama to not voting, and voters who went from not voting in 2012 to backing Trump in 2016.

Voters expressed concerns about immigration and trade in ways that alluded to a complex mixture of both social and economic anxieties. Many worried that immigrants speak foreign languages, but conveyed such anxieties in tandem with (perhaps exaggerated) concerns about competition over jobs.

The authors also found that a drop over four years in the number of business establishments in a congressional district led to substantially more votes for Trump than for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, as well as voters expressing a sense of being left behind in the economic recovery tied closely to support for Trump.

For many voters, the very real impact of globalization, outsourcing, wage stagnation, increasing student loan debt, and an uneven economic recovery since 2008 financial crisis has been caused by largely invisible forces. The economic decisions that influence manufacturing, trade, or salaries are made miles away, behind closed doors and with little media coverage. The communities that are most affected are left wondering who’s to blame. Traditional politicians promise solutions but fail to deliver. That disparity means that voters feeling the short end of the economic order might easily fall prey to efforts to scapegoat much more visible trends in society, such as increasing diversity, immigration, and advances by women and minorities.

The authors suggest that economic stagnation for entire regions of the country, particularly in rural communities and once thriving manufacturing hubs, meant voters were most susceptible to the belief that America was on the “wrong track” and were likely to gravitate toward Trump. In response to open-ended questions, they expressed a desire for a tough-talking strong leader who could protect social safety net programs while taking a sledge hammer to trade and immigration.

The answers to the surveys show many individuals with a preference for Trump also asserted that there is no major difference between the parties, that health costs are too high, that moneyed interests control the political system, that increased imports into the country have destroyed local jobs, critiques that are often associated with left-wing economic concerns.

Voters rarely fit into neat ideological or moral boxes. A survey conducted by Reuters during the 2016 election showed that as many as a third of Hillary Clinton’s voters viewed African Americans as “more ‘criminal’ than whites” and “more ‘violent’ than whites,” despite the candidate stressing anti-racist principles on the stump.

The Mob and Capital

The study repeatedly cites political theorist Hannah Arendt’s “alliance between the mob and capital,” the idea that powerful elites exploit widespread economic discontent and channel anger away from economic reform and toward social scapegoats.

Trump harnessed economic distress to blame minorities and immigrants for the nation’s woes. But he was certainly not the only billionaire using this strategy. The Koch brothers and other major donors have long channeled anger about the economy at religious and ethnic minorities. The small set of Super PACs and dark money groups that funded the late-election surge in pro-Trump advertising, along with the media conglomerates that gave Trump promotional coverage worth billions of dollars during the election, also certainly fit the mould of elite influence over the election. The “alliance between mob and capital,” the authors write, may be at the heart of Trump’s election victory.

The open-ended ANES survey results also show the wide and pervasive perception that Clinton was “corrupt.” In contrast to Clinton, Trump certainly attempted to position himself as an outsider to the political system, a business leader who could forge deals that no normal politician could. The authors caution that such an election, with two highly unpopular candidates and many distinctive personal traits, may not offer the ideal scenario for testing questions about the roots of populism.

But the election does offer some clues. Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric was uniquely combined with a rejection of the business-centric consensus on trade and immigration. Virtually every major Republican, including all of the presidential candidates, had made assurances to cut social spending. Trump stood apart by offering a particular right-wing blend of populism and economic promises once associated with the Democratic Party. His brash rhetoric and willingness to ostracize minorities was part and parcel of his style of populism, which blended demagoguery about perceived outsiders with anger over inequality and lopsided economic policy.

The research paper, however, notes that future Democratic candidates should take heed that economic distress still motivates large swaths of the American electorate.

“Fundamentally, these guys [the Democrats] lost votes because the voters could not tell the difference between the two parties, they lost votes because people wanted relief from imports, they didn’t want globalization,” said Ferguson, one of the authors and the Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the University of Massachusetts Boston, in an interview with The Intercept.

But the Trump playbook in many ways echoes other breakout underdog candidates.

In 2008, Obama campaigned aggressively against free trade agreements and outsourcing, mocking Clinton as “a cheerleader for NAFTA for more than a decade.” Obama established himself as a political outsider, deriding Clinton for taking “more money from lobbyists than any other candidate, Democratic or Republican.” Obama as a candidate managed to avoid any of the racism or sexism of the Trump campaign, while similarly positioning himself as an outsider uniquely situated to give voice to the rage against the political and economic establishment. That year, Obama went on to win states long viewed as ruby red, such as Indiana and North Carolina, along with every Rust Belt state.

The same could be said about Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a relatively obscure candidate with little political resources and facing a virtual blackout in broadcast media coverage, who catapulted ahead of Clinton in several states during the 2016 Democratic primary, by voicing concerns about economic anxiety over trade, health care, corruption and low wages.

“Lots of people feel completely left out from the recovery. There’s a dual economy. People feel squeezed from the middle class, they don’t know how they can send their kids to school,” Ferguson said. “There were a lot of poor people who should have voted Democratic but switched and we distinguish those groups in our study.”"

That would be California, which is growing faster and outperforming the U.S. in job growth, manufacturing, personal income, corporate profits and the total return of its bonds. The most populous U.S. state, with 39.5 million people, supplanted the U.K. as No. 5 in the world with an equivalent gross domestic product of more than $2.7 trillion, increasing $127 billion last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Trump attributes the prosperity of the U.S. economy during his 17 months as president to his evisceration of environmental regulations and other consumer protections, abandoning the Paris climate accord, aggressively deporting undocumented immigrants, prohibiting people from certain nations (mostly majority Muslim) from emigrating to the U.S., prosecuting sanctuary cities for protecting immigrants, cutting taxes most for corporations and the rich, and appointing a Supreme Court justice who just wrote the 5-4 decision limiting the rights of tens of millions of workers."

Analysis: It’s the 'economy, stupid'. And right now, the Trump economy is blasting off

— -- Davos, Switzerland — It’s not Comey. Or Mueller. Or the Russians. Or Stormy Daniels.

It’s the economy, stupid.

And right now, the Trump economy is blasting off.

Davos Man likes.

In conversations with business and political leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, there is almost zero mention of the controversies which consume coverage of Trump in America.

Instead, people talk about the real possibility now that growth in the U.S. economy could hit 4 percent this year — a positively Clintonian benchmark. The impact worldwide would be tremendous.

We forget what that kind of economy means. Clinton averaged roughly 4 percent GDP growth. Record budget surpluses. Record job growth. Real household incomes up across the board. A skyrocketing stock market.

Money in peoples’ pockets—for college, for retirement, for vacations. Businesses booming. New ones starting. And the USA once again the engine pulling the world economy.

We’re a long way from that, for sure.

And there are analysts who say the world’s economies are simply being boosted by all the easy money central banks pumped into them for years — and that’s a bubble that will burst.

But business types here disagree. And they give a lot of credit to Trump for the renewed strength and vigor they sense in the sinews of the global economy.

Deregulation is the first thing they mention. The cost of doing business has come down fast. That means margins will go up. That’s why so many investors see American companies as such good bets.

And that’s all Trump.

The tax cut is also—no surprise—hugely popular here. It seems the old US corporate tax structure was operating as a kind of logjam in the world economy, freezing up the flow of money and distorting investment decisions.

The dam broke. Trump broke it.

And now corporations are paying bonuses and boosting wages for American workers. All that money is just now beginning to hit the economy.

One example: J.P. Morgan says it will spend $20 billion over five years to raise hourly pay of its workers and open new branches in the U.S., as a direct result of the tax cut.

“I think it’s possible you’re going to hit 4 percent sometime this year,” CEO Jamie Dimon said here in Davos. “I promise you, we are going to be sitting here in a year and you all will be worrying about inflation and wages going too high.”

Needless to say, if the American economy is running at 4 percent growth later this year—Democrats can probably kiss goodbye to their dreams of a wave election sweeping them into power.

And if Trump and Congress pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that would pour more money into the US economy next year—2020 looks very different, too.

Trump may be benefiting from the hard work of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve in recovering from the worst economic downturn in 80 years. But he is surely benefiting.

And it may be that he, like Ronald Reagan, is lucky in his timing in another, deeper way.

At the moment both men came to power, an economic paradigm had hit a dead end.

For Reagan, the New Deal approach to the economy had faltered, growth had dried up, inflation raged, working-class Americans were struggling and beginning to give up hope.

For Trump, the “neoliberal” approach that Reagan had helped to establish and Clinton had refined, had faltered. Growth had slowed, inequality had skyrocketed, working-class Americans felt abandoned and many despaired, turning to opiates and anger for relief.

Things needed to change. In 1980 and in 2016.

The direction of the change may differ profoundly, but maybe it’s just the jolt of change itself that counts. Maybe the economy just needs a good hard kick from time to time to get the engine to turn over and the thing going forward again."

But just as Turkey’s finance minister, Berat Albayrak, unveiled a new plan for the economy on August 10th, America’s president, Donald Trump, tweeted that he would double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium products. The lira plummeted further. In the course of an hour, it reached a new low of 6.80 to the dollar, marking its worst daily performance in over a decade. It recovered a little afterwards, but has lost about 40% of its value against the dollar since the start of the year.

Mr Trump’s decision came in the middle of an increasingly heated dispute between the two estranged NATO allies. America’s Treasury froze the assets of two Turkish ministers last week over their role in the arrest and continued detention of an American pastor. (A deal that would have seen the pastor sent home fell apart at the last minute.) A Turkish delegation dispatched to Washington to defuse tensions appears to have made no progress. Turkey and the Trump administration are at loggerheads over a number of other issues. Turkey has struck a deal to buy an advanced missile system from Russia, which has unsettled many of its NATO partners.

One of the country's biggest banks has been implicated in a scheme to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Turkey is also furious with America for outsourcing its war against Islamic State militants in Syria to what it considers to be a Kurdish terrorist group. Some Turkish officials have accused America of having a hand in an abortive coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two summers ago.

Mr Erdogan seems to be in no mood for concessions. He points to the collapse of the lira as part of a plot against Turkey. In a speech made before Mr Trump's tariff announcement, the Turkish strongman said his country was in the middle of an ""economic war” against outside powers, and asked his supporters to save the lira by cashing in their dollars and euros. “That would be the best response we can give to the West,” he said.

But the lira was under pressure long before the latest row with America. Encouraged by their president, who has leaned on the central bank to keep lending rates low, Turkish companies have binged on cheap credit, much of it denominated in dollars. They have accumulated over $220bn in debt. Inflation reached nearly 16% last month. Mr Albayrak, who is also the president’s son-in-law, and whose appointment as finance minister last month has further unnerved investors, has been unable to rise to the challenge. As the lira set one record low after another, he waited for a week before presenting a programme that was largely devoid of specific reform proposals. Meanwhile, the central bank has buried its head in the sand. It last raised interest rates on June 7th. The lira has since lost about a third of its value.

Earlier this month, about three-in-ten (31%) said in a Pew Research Center survey that this year’s speech is “more important” than those in past years, compared with 18% who said it is less important (43% said it’s about as important as past State of the Union addresses). Here is a look at public opinion on important issues facing the country, drawn from the Center’s recent surveys:

1 The economy and jobs: Americans’ views of economic conditions are more positive than they have been in recent years. An October survey found 41% of Americans rating economic conditions in the country as “excellent” or “good,” near the highest point in a decade. The public’s improving economic outlook is reflected in its policy agenda for Trump and Congress in the coming year. Economic issues – improving the job situation, strengthening the economy and reducing the budget deficit – are now viewed as less important policy priorities than they were just a few years ago, according to a survey conducted earlier this month.

The public’s view of local job availability has also improved substantially in recent years. In October, half of Americans said there are plenty of jobs available in their communities – the highest assessment in Pew Research Center surveys dating to 2001. Despite the public’s brighter outlook on jobs, however, there has been little change in the share of Americans (49%) who say their family’s income is falling behind the cost of living.

2Taxes: The public has mixed expectations for the tax law recently passed by Congress and Trump. About as many say the law will have a mostly positive effect on them and their families (29%) as say its effect will be mostly negative (27%). A third of U.S. adults expect the law to not have much personal impact. Views also are split on how the law will affect the country as a whole, with 35% saying it will positively impact the nation and 40% anticipating a mostly negative effect. Just 15% say the law won’t have much effect on the country. These views vary by party and income. Those with higher incomes are more likely to say they will personally benefit from the new tax law.

3 Terrorism and global threats: Defending against terrorism continues to rank among the public’s leading priorities for the president and Congress, with nearly three-quarters (73%) saying it is a top priority.

Americans’ views of the campaign against ISIS specifically have sharply improved. Last fall, a majority of Americans (55%) said for the first time that the campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria is going well, up from just 31% a year earlier, with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents driving much of the overall increase. The public approves of the campaign overall (69%), but Americans have mixed views on whether it has made much difference on the chances of a terrorist attack in the United States. Similar shares of Democrats and Democratic leaners (46%) and Republicans and GOP leaners (47%) said the campaign has not made much difference. (Note: All further references to parties include leaners.)

Majorities in both parties agree that ISIS, North Korea’s nuclear program and cyberattacks from other countries pose “major threats” to the U.S., according to a survey conducted in October 2017. But there are partisan differences on other perceived threats. For example, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to see Russia’s power and influence as a major threat (63% vs. 38%). The large partisan gap on views of Russia only emerged after the 2016 presidential election. For several years before that, Republican and Democratic views about the threat posed by Russia were generally similar.

4Foreign policy: The public is evenly divided over whether the U.S. should “be active in world affairs” or “pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems here at home” (47% each), according to a July 2017 survey. The share favoring U.S. global involvement has increased from 35% in 2014, the last time this question was asked. A partisan gap has emerged on this question as Democrats increasingly say the U.S. should play an active role globally (56% say this, up from 38% in 2014).

When it comes to dealing with U.S. allies in global affairs, 59% of Americans say the U.S. should take into account the interests of its allies, even if it means making compromises with them; 36% say the U.S. should follow its own national interests even when its allies strongly disagree. While 74% of Democrats say allies’ interests should be taken into account, 54% of Republicans say the U.S. should follow its own interests when there is strong disagreement.

5 Immigration: Most Americans say immigrants strengthen the country with their hard work and talents (65%), rather than say that immigrants burden the country by taking jobs and other resources. Public views of immigrants have moved in a more positive direction over the past several years.

Two issues central to the current immigration debate – the status of immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children and expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall – have very different patterns of support among the public. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. adults (74%) favor granting permanent legal status to immigrants brought here illegally as children, and just 37% favor substantially expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

There are substantial partisan differences in views of both policies. However, while Republicans and Democrats are on opposite sides of the issue of expanding the border wall (72% of Republicans favor, 85% of Democrats oppose), among both Democrats and Republicans more favor than oppose permanent legal status for immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children (50% of Republicans and 92% of Democrats favor this).

6Trade: Amid negotiations over the quarter-century-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Americans generally express positive views of the trade pact. Most Americans (56%) say that, all in all, the agreement is good for the U.S., according to an October survey. But Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say the pact is bad for the U.S. (54% vs. 18%), and to say that it benefits Mexico more than the United States. In recent years, partisans have moved apart in their assessments of free trade agreements in general, as Republicans have generally grown more negative in their views.

7Health care: Despite repeated efforts by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 health care law known as the Affordable Care Act, more Americans see the law as having a positive effect on the U.S. than a negative effect (44% vs. 35%), according to a survey conducted in December. The share of Americans saying the law has had a positive effect on the country has increased 20 percentage points since 2013.

The same survey found that 69% of Americans say the federal government should play a major role in ensuring access to health care. Yet only 36% say the government is doing a very or somewhat good job at ensuring health care access, down from 56% in 2015.

8Regulation: Half of the public says government regulation of business is necessary to protect the public interest, while 45% say it usually does more harm than good. Views on this question have been split for several years as partisan divides have grown wider. Democratic support for business regulation is now higher than it was during much of the 1990s and 2000s. As of July 2017, two-thirds of Democrats (66%) say government regulation is necessary to protect the public interest, while just 31% of Republicans say the same. When it comes to government’s role on specific issues, such as ensuring safe food and medicine, large majorities say the government should play a “major role.”



9Environment: While partisans agree on some assessments of what Trump and Congress’ top priorities are, climate change and the environment are among the most divisive. Nearly seven-in-ten Democrats (68%) say dealing with climate change should be a top policy priority, 50 percentage points higher than the share of Republicans who say so (18%). And while 81% of Democrats say protecting the environment should be a top priority, just 37% of Republicans say the same.

There is also an increasingly wide partisan gap when it comes to environmental laws and regulations. In July 2017, 77% of Democrats said stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, while 58% of Republicans say such regulations cost too many jobs and hurt the economy.

10 Race relations: Nearly a year into Trump’s presidency, a majority of Americans (60%) say his election has worsened race relations in the United States. Three-in-ten say Trump’s election has not made a difference when it comes to race relations, and just 8% say his election has made them better. Just after Trump’s election in 2016, nearly half of Republican voters (48%) said they expected his election to lead to improved race relations. Roughly a year later, just 17% of Republicans say it has. Meanwhile, about eight-in-ten Democratic voters (83%) say Trump’s election has made race relations worse, little different than the share who expected his election to lead to worse race relations in November 2016 (81%).

Opinions about the overall state of race relations in the country remain more negative than positive. Today, just 38% say race relations are generally good, while 56% say they are generally bad.

In a way, that’s good news. If Trump focuses on trade, where little of substance is likely to change, it could distract him from areas like health care and immigration where he could do more lasting damage. But Navarro’s promotion, and the protectionist agenda it’s likely to usher in, will probably not be very helpful for the U.S. economy."

Citing the need to protect national security, last month he released plans to impose tariffs of 25 percent on foreign steel and 10 percent on aluminum for a “long period of time.” More recently, he placed $50 billion worth of tariffs on China, which released its own retaliatory tariffs.

The president’s new trade barriers stem directly from the “America First” policy he has been promoting since the presidential campaign. Trump is orienting the country distinctly toward protectionism and claiming that unilateralism in trade is good for the U.S.

But economic history should make Americans skeptical of this claim.

President Trump’s approach to trade seems to be based on a false understanding of how the global economy works, one that also plagued American policymakers nearly a century ago. Essentially, the administration has forgotten an important lesson from the Great Depression.

Virtually all economists and trade researchers like me agree that the costs could be steep.

The U.S. and the global economy

Trump’s “America First” orientation assumes that the United States, as the world’s dominant actor, can behave freely and independently in trade.

Unfortunately for the administration, America’s top economic position does not shield it from the dire consequences that unilateral trade policy can provoke. The constraints on U.S. action result from the basic nature of the international economy and from America’s declining dominance of the world trade system.

It is a standard principle of economics that all individual actors exist within a system. Any action taken by one actor will likely result in a response from others. This means that wise governments, in considering which policies to adopt, must make difficult calculations about how their actions will interact with those of others.

“America First” fails to make these calculations. It disregards how America’s trading partners will respond to the new U.S. protectionism – which is also what American lawmakers ignored during the Great Depression.

‘Beggar-thy-neighbor’

Before the 1930s, America’s trade policy was generally set unilaterally by Congress – that is, without the international negotiations used today.

Lawmakers, already in a protectionist mood, responded to the pain of the Great Depression by passing the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised duties on hundreds of imports.

Meant in part to ease the effects of the Depression by protecting American industry and agriculture from foreign competition, the act instead helped prolong the downturn. Many U.S. trading partners reacted by raising their own tariffs, which contributed significantly to shutting down world trade.

Fortunately, the U.S. and the world learned a lesson from this experience. With the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 and its successors, which granted the president authority to reach tariff reduction agreements with foreign governments, U.S. trade policy came to be global and strategic. This new approach was institutionalized at the international level with the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1948 and its successor, the World Trade Organization, in 1995.

The basic principle of these agreements is reciprocity – that each country will agree to liberalize its trade to the extent that other countries liberalize theirs. The approach uses international negotiations to overcome protectionist political pressures and recognizes that trade is a global phenomenon that generates national interdependence.

Dangers of ignoring history

The dangers of ignoring history are only beginning to manifest themselves, but they can be seen in several recent developments that bode ill for us all.

One of the Trump administration’s first actions was to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This agreement, which was a major initiative of the Obama administration, would have created the largest economic bloc in the world by linking America’s economy with those of 11 other Pacific nations. It would also have created an American-led liberal bulwark in Asia against any Chinese challenge to the regional economic order.

Withdrawing from the agreement denied American exporters enhanced access to foreign markets and was a gift to Chinese influence in Asia. But we are only now beginning to see the longer-term repercussions of President Trump’s decision.

During Trump’s trip, the other 11 signatories of the original trade deal, including Japan, Australia, Canada and Mexico, agreed to move forward without the U.S. This is a problem for the U.S. because it means that these countries will grant preferential market access to one another, making it harder for American companies to compete in their markets.

American companies are already feeling the impact of what happens when they’re left out of a trade deal. A recent New York Times article, for example, highlights the plight of American lobster producers whose prices are being undercut by Canadian producers in the wake of a new Canada-European Union trade agreement.

If the United States is reluctant to participate in multilateral trade agreements, other countries have every incentive to do deals that exclude and even may hurt the U.S.

Trump’s ongoing efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement also pose potential dangers. The administration has a tendency to speak of renegotiation as if it can dictate the terms. But while Canada and Mexico may be more dependent on the U.S. than the U.S. is on them, an implosion of NAFTA would be devastating for many U.S. industries that rely on North American trade. Market analysts increasingly worry that NAFTA may not survive the negotiations.

In addition to withdrawing from and renegotiating trade agreements, the administration has ramped up unilateral efforts to sanction U.S. trading partners for receiving subsidies or for dumping their products on the American market.

Decisions to impose trade penalties – such as those against China – risk severe blowback, as when sanctions on Bombardier drove the Canadian plane manufacturer into the arms of Airbus, Boeing’s top foreign rival. The imposition of sanctions on imports of solar panels is having a similar effect, damaging American panel installers and encouraging foreign retaliation. China’s already-announced retaliatory tariffs could be just the beginning.

Trade needs a champion

President Trump assumes the U.S. can act unilaterally without consequences.

Economic history shows this doesn’t work. The world’s economies are far more interdependent than they were during the Great Depression, so the impact of governments all following a “my country first” trade policy – as the president said he expected world leaders to do – could have disastrous consequences.

Today, the international trade system the U.S. helped create, one based on open markets and classically liberal principles, is under threat as never before. Yet President Trump’s “America First” approach is a total abdication of the traditional U.S. role as its defender. And in fact, the president is doing his best to undermine that system.

In my final analysis, the Trump administration is reverting to a policy that is, I would argue, dangerous for the U.S. economy and for the international system.

If the U.S. abdicates as champion of the international trading system, China may be the only country that can take the reins. The question is, what would that mean for the current system of open and free markets?

Trump said he was ordering the EPA to reopen a mid-term review of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards that would require the industry to deliver a fleet average of at least 54.5 mpg by 2025. Many — though not all — manufacturers have warned they cannot meet that target without raising vehicle prices beyond what consumers could afford, something Ford CEO Mark Fields in January told the president could cost 1 million automotive jobs.

The announcement that the government would review both the mileage target and timing was actually less of a radical development than many had expected, with some industry observers questioning whether the new administration might slash the numbers immediately or, perhaps, repeal CAFE entirely as part of Trump’s promise to reduce government regulations.

Controversial EPA Head

Such moves might yet happen, environmentalists fear, especially with the recent confirmation of Scott Pruitt, a long-time agency critic, as head of the EPA. Another prospect is that the administration may revoke the waiver that allows California to set its own emissions standards. The state has used that rule to demand automakers start rolling out large numbers of zero-emissions vehicles, such as the hydrogen-powered models from Honda, Toyota and Hyundai, as well as battery cars like the Tesla Model S and Chevrolet Bolt EV. A dozen states have now copied the California mandate.

CAFE dates back to the 1970s, when Congress decided to force the industry to reduce dependence upon foreign oil in the wake of the first Mideast oil embargo. The 2025 target was set as part of a compromise reached between the Obama Administration and the auto industry. But in recent years, as oil prices have plunged, and Americans have shifted from small, fuel-efficient sedans to big SUVs and pickups, that has complicated the effort of meeting the 54.5 mpg target.

The mandate called for a mid-term review to see if the goal remained feasible. Despite strong industry demands for relief, the EPA sided with environmentalists, issuing what Trump decried as an “11th hour” ruling ordering the mileage mandate to stand just days before Obama left office.

The new president positioned his decision along the lines outlined by Ford CEO Fields, arguing that, “This is going to be a new era for American jobs and job creation,” during a media roundtable. The visit to Michigan was held at the site of the old B24 bomber plant from World War II in the Detroit suburb of Ypsilanti. It is now being converted to a test track for the development of autonomous vehicles.

“My administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations,” Trump said, his new EPA chief Pruitt adding his assertion that “these standards are costly for automakers and the American people.”

Not surprisingly, automakers praised the Wednesday announcement, though the president’s action also was roundly condemned by those who said it would condemn Americans to deal with dirtier air, a warming global climate and be a boondoggle for energy companies.

Pollution Concerns

California Governor Jerry Brown called the move “an unconscionable gift for polluters,” adding that his state will launch a lawsuit, along with New York, challenging the re-opening of the review.

“If they succeed, we’ll pay more at the pump, depend more on oil from bad countries, drive up the trade deficit and pollute our kids,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign.

Ordering the mid-term review reopened, a final decision might not be made until as late as April of 2018. That raises the question of how the auto industry will respond. Key planning moves, particular when it comes to investments on advanced powertrains and other key, energy saving technologies, must be made years in advance, and several industry officials said they’ve already begun laying out strategies, and making preliminary investments, reaching out to 2025.

They may be reluctant to now hold back on the assumption of a CAFE rollback by the Trump Administration, especially if that were to face a credible legal challenge.

At the worst for environmentalists, automakers might decide to cut some of their zero-emission and alternative energy programs. At a more benign level, observers suggested, the industry might simply use a cut in the 54.5 mpg target to increase their mix of less efficient light trucks.

Renewed Efforts on Electric

In recent months, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has said the automaker “remains committed” to adding more plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Volt and the Chevy Bolt EV.

Foreign-based makers seem even more determined to stay the course with high-efficiency gasoline and alternative-power vehicles.

“No matter what happens in the U.S., we will not change any of our plans for electrified vehicles and more efficient vehicles,” Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn declared during a news conference at the Geneva Motor Show last week.

That stand was echoed by Steve Center, the vice president of the Environmental Business Office at American Honda. “It doesn’t change anything. We, as an organization, have beliefs, and we are going to tear up our plans.”

Honda is just launching its new Clarity FCV, a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle, and its global CEO recently reaffirmed plans to have fully half of the company’s products powered either by batteries or hydrogen by 2025.

Center said Honda isn’t entirely pleased with strict mandates, like CAFE, in part because “No government can regulate what people buy.” And so, as the current surge of demand for pickups and SUVs demonstrates, it can become more difficult to meet mandates while also giving consumers the products they want.

While automakers like Nissan, Honda and Toyota are expected to continue introducing more green vehicles, industry analysts say they may still wind up lowering their own corporate mileage targets by increasing production of their own light truck models — such as the Nissan Murano SUV, the new midsize Honda Ridgeline pickup and the full-size Toyota Tundra pickup.

Global Standards

One reason why all makers, Detroit, European or Asian, may find it difficult to make major shifts in their strategies is the fact that they all operate on a global scale. With a few exceptions, notably their big pickups, automakers design their vehicles to be sold around the world.

And so, said Nissan’s Ghosn, even if the U.S. rolls back CAFE, the likelihood is for even tougher emissions standards in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China. “We’re going to have to keep an eye” on those rules, and develop vehicles accordingly, he said, no matter what happens in the U.S."

Executive Summary Perhaps the most contested question from the 2016 presidential election is what factors motivated white working-class voters to support Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of roughly two to one. New analysis by PRRI and The Atlantic, based on surveys conducted before and after the 2016 election, developed a model to test a variety of potential factors influencing support for Trump among white working-class voters. The model identifies five significant independent predictors of support for Trump among white working-class voters. No other factors were significant at conventional levels. Overall, the model demonstrates that besides partisanship, fears about immigrants and cultural displacement were more powerful factors than economic concerns in predicting support for Trump among white working-class voters. Moreover, the effects of economic concerns were complex—with economic fatalism predicting support for Trump, but economic hardship predicting support for Clinton. Identification with the Republican Party. Identifying as Republican, not surprisingly, was strongly predictive of Trump support. White working-class voters who identified as Republican were 11 times more likely to support Trump than those who did not identify as Republican. No other demographic attribute was significant. Fears about cultural displacement. White working-class voters who say they often feel like a stranger in their own land and who believe the U.S. needs protecting against foreign influence were 3.5 times more likely to favor Trump than those who did not share these concerns. Support for deporting immigrants living in the country illegally. White working-class voters who favored deporting immigrants living in the country illegally were 3.3 times more likely to express a preference for Trump than those who did not. Economic fatalism. White working-class voters who said that college education is a gamble were almost twice as likely to express a preference for Trump as those who said it was an important investment in the future. Economic hardship. Notably, while only marginally significant at conventional levels (P<0.1), being in fair or poor financial shape actually predicted support for Hillary Clinton among white working-class Americans, rather than support for Donald Trump. Those who reported being in fair or poor financial shape were 1.7 times more likely to support Clinton, compared to those who were in better financial shape. It is notable that many attitudes and attributes identified as possible explanations for Trump’s support among white working-class voters were not significant independent predictors. Gender, age, region, and religious affiliation were not significant demographic factors in the model. Views about gender roles and attitudes about race were also not significant. It is also notable that neither measure of civic engagement—attendance at civic events or religious services—proved to be a significant independent predictor of support for Trump. The report also provides an in-depth profile of white working-class Americans, along with analysis of this group’s world view, outlook, and attitudes about cultural change and policy: Nearly two-thirds (65%) of white working-class Americans believe American culture and way of life has deteriorated since the 1950s.

Nearly half (48%) of white working-class Americans say, “things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.”

Nearly seven in ten (68%) white working-class Americans believe the American way of life needs to be protected from foreign influence. In contrast, fewer than half (44%) of white college-educated Americans express this view.

Nearly seven in ten (68%) white working-class Americans—along with a majority (55%) of the public overall—believe the U.S. is in danger of losing its culture and identity.

More than six in ten (62%) white working-class Americans believe the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens American culture, while three in ten (30%) say these newcomers strengthen society.

Nearly six in ten (59%) white working-class Americans believe immigrants living in the country illegally should be allowed to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements, while 10% say they should be allowed to become permanent legal residents. More than one in four (27%) say we should identify and deport illegal immigrants. Notably, support for a path to citizenship is only slightly lower than support among the general public (63%).

More than half (52%) of white working-class Americans believe discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities, while 70% of white college-educated Americans disagree.

Fewer than four in ten white working-class Americans report they are in excellent (5%) or good shape (33%) financially, compared to six in ten who say they are in fair (35%) or poor shape (25%). White working-class Americans about as likely to say their financial situation has diminished (27%) as they are to say it has improved (29%). White college-educated Americans, in contrast, are about three times as likely to say their financial circumstances have gotten better than gotten worse (41% vs. 14%, respectively).

A majority (54%) of the white working class view getting a college education as a risky gamble, while only 44% say it is a smart investment.

Six in ten (60%) white working-class Americans, compared to only 32% of white college-educated Americans say because things have gotten so far off track, we need a strong leader who is willing to break the rules.

II. A Profile of the White Working Class Size and Regional Distribution Overall, white working-class Americans make up one-third (33%) of the adult public, a substantially larger share than white Americans with at least a four-year college education (22%).1 In no region do white working-class Americans comprise a larger proportion of the population than in the Midwest, where they account for more than four in ten (43%) Americans. Roughly three in ten Americans living in the Northeast (30%) and South (31%) are white working class, while only roughly one-quarter (26%) of those living in the West are white working class. White working-class Americans also make up a disproportionate number of those living in rural areas. Just over half (51%) of Americans living in rural areas are white working class, compared to about one in five (22%) of those living in America’s urban areas. Union Membership Despite the white working class’ historical connection to labor unions, relatively few members of the white working class today have a union member in their household. Only 14% of white working-class Americans report living in a household with someone who is a member of a labor union. The rate of union membership in white working-class households has not changed significantly since 2012 (16%). Union membership varies starkly among the white working class by geographic region and political affiliation. The Northeast stands out as the region where white working-class Americans are most likely to be unionized. Nearly one-quarter (24%) of white working-class Northeasterners report living in a household where at least one person is a union member. Fewer than one in five white working-class Americans living in the Midwest (18%) and West (15%) have a family member in their household who is a member of a union. Only eight percent of white working-class Southerners say the same. Union membership also varies among the white working class by political affiliation. White working-class Democrats are almost twice as likely as white working-class Republicans to live in a union household (21% vs. 12%, respectively). White working-class independents mirror the white working class overall. Religious Affiliation More than seven in ten (71%) white working-class Americans identify as Christian, and white working-class Americans are significantly more likely than the general population to identify as evangelical. Roughly one-third (31%) identify as evangelical Protestant, another one in five (20%) identify as mainline Protestant, and roughly one in five (17%) identify as Catholic. One-quarter (25%) of white working-class Americans are religiously unaffiliated, a rate comparable to the general population. Only three percent of the white working class belong to a non-Christian religious tradition. The generational differences in religious affiliation among white working-class Americans are more pronounced than among the general public. More than eight in ten white working-class seniors (age 65 and older) identify as Christian: 39% are evangelical Protestant, 22% are mainline Protestant, and 23% are Catholic. Among white working-class young adults (ages 18-29), only about four in ten identify as Christian: 16% are evangelical, 16% are mainline Protestant, and 10% are Catholic. Young adults (age 18-29) who are white working class are more likely to identify as religiously unaffiliated than young adults overall. Nearly half (47%) of white working-class young adults are religiously unaffiliated, compared to 36% of young adults overall. Only one in ten (10%) white working-class seniors are religiously unaffiliated. Political Profile Political Affiliation and Ideology A slim majority (51%) of white working-class Americans identify with or lean toward the Republican Party.2 About one-third (34%) are affiliated with or lean toward the Democratic Party. Americans overall lean the opposite direction, with significantly more identifying with or leaning toward the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party (47% vs. 41%, respectively). White working-class Southerners stand out for their exceptionally strong attachment to the Republican Party. Nearly six in ten (58%) white working-class Southerners identify as Republican or lean Republican, compared to fewer than half who live in the Northeast (46%), Midwest (48%), and West (47%). In the general population, younger Americans are significantly more likely than older Americans to identify with or lean towards the Democratic Party. But younger white working-class Americans are actually less Democratic than those who are older. A majority (57%) of white working-class young adults identify as Republican or lean towards the GOP, compared to only 29% who identify as or lean Democratic—a gap of 28 percentage points. Among white working-class seniors, the party identification gap is only 15 percentage points, with 51% at least leaning toward the Republican Party and 36% leaning toward the Democratic Party. The patterns of ideological identification among the white working class largely follow the patterns of partisan identification. White working-class Americans are twice as likely to identify as conservative (43%) than liberal (21%). Fewer than one in three (29%) identify as politically moderate. Notably, however, even though younger white working-class Americans are more likely than white working-class seniors to identify as Republican, they are less likely to identify as conservative. White working-class young adults are less than half as likely as white working-class seniors to identify as conservative (23% vs. 50%, respectively). Four in ten (40%) young white working-class Americans are moderate, and more than one-quarter (26%) identify as liberal. Trump vs. Clinton: Who Understands the Needs of the White Working Class? White working-class Americans generally believe that President Donald Trump, rather than Hillary Clinton, better understands the problems facing their community. However, neither candidate garners a majority saying he or she understands white working-class problems well. Only about four in ten white working-class Americans believe Trump understands the problems facing their community either very (16%) or somewhat well (26%), compared to a slim majority (51%) who say he does not understand their problems well. Fewer than one-third of white working-class Americans say Clinton understands their community’s problems either very (10%) or somewhat (22%) well. More than six in ten (62%) say that she does not really understand the problems facing their community. Despite the conventional wisdom that Trump attracted financially depressed voters, white working-class Americans who report being in good or excellent financial shape are significantly more likely to say that Trump understands their problems than those who report their financial condition as being fair or poor (48% vs. 39%, respectively). A majority (55%) of white working-class Americans in fair or poor shape say Trump does not understand the problems facing their communities well. White working-class men are also more likely than women to believe Trump appreciates the challenges facing their community. Close to half (47%) of white working-class men say Trump understands the problems in their community, while only 38% of white working-class women say the same. “I think it’s much less that Trump gets it and much more a desire to gamble on big change. It’s almost like we’re setting the reset button, we’re saying: ‘Okay, we’ve had all these politicians in here for so long, we’ve got another politician whose husband was in there for eight years, she has the potential of being in there eight years.’ There’s so many career politicians, and it seems like Trump’s entire campaign was, ‘I’m not a career politician. I may not know what I’m doing but I’m not that. So put me in there, let’s give something else, anything else, a try and see how it goes.’ And like I told everyone during the election, he’s got four years, he blows it up, we start over again.” – Man Middle-aged white working-class Americans are more likely than either younger or older white working-class Americans to believe Trump understands the problems in their community. Only about one-third (34%) of white working-class Americans under the age of 30 say Trump understands challenges confronting their community well. Close to half of white working-class Americans age 30 to 49 (47%) and age 50 to 64 (46%) say Trump appreciates the issues they face. Among white working-class seniors (age 65 and older), fewer than four in ten (38%) believe Trump really understands the problems they face.

III. An Economic Portrait of the White Working Class Household Income There are profound differences in household income levels between white working-class Americans and whites with a college degree. A majority (57%) of white working-class Americans live in households earning less than $50,000 per year, including nearly four in ten (39%) making less than $30,000 per year. Fewer than one in five (19%) white college-educated Americans report household incomes of less than $50,000 a year. White college-educated Americans are nearly five times more likely to live in households with annual incomes of at least $100,000 (39% vs. 8%, respectively). Perceptions of Personal Financial Conditions White working-class Americans are especially pessimistic about their current finances. Fewer than four in ten report they are in excellent (5%) or good (33%) shape financially, compared to six in ten who say they are in fair (35%) or poor shape (25%). White college-educated Americans, in contrast, are much more positive: nearly two-thirds report being in excellent (18%) or good (46%) financial shape, while only about one-third say they their financial shape is fair (27%) or poor (7%). White working-class men have slightly more negative views of their current financial situation than white working-class women. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of white working-class men say they are in fair or poor shape, compared to 58% of white working-class women. Half (50%) of white working-class seniors report being in good or excellent financial shape—a rate significantly higher than other age groups. In contrast, fewer than four in ten white working-class Americans age 50 to 64 (31%), age 30 to 49 (39%), or age 18 to 29 (34%) say their economic circumstances are either good or excellent. Perceptions of Socioeconomic Mobility Nearly six in ten white working-class Americans say their family was “working class” (40%) or “lower class” (19%) when they were growing up. Notably, about four in ten white working-class Americans report that they grew up in “middle-class” (29%) or “upper-class” (11%) households. In contrast, only about four in ten white college-educated Americans report that their family’s financial standing when they were growing up was “working class” (35%) or “lower class” (6%). Additionally, white college-educated Americans are more likely than the white working class to be raised in middle-class (42%) or upper-class households (16%). Compared to white college-educated Americans, white working-class Americans who came out of “working-class” or “lower-class” homes are more likely to report being in a similar position today. Nearly seven in ten (69%) white working-class Americans raised in “working-class” or “lower-class” households describe their current social class that way today. In contrast, only 30% of white college-educated Americans who say their family’s financial situation was “working class” or “lower class,” still identify this way today. “It’s that kind of mentality with the businesses that we work for these days that they know they can get away with paying us nothing half the time because they know we have nowhere to go.” —Man White working-class Americans are far less likely than white college-educated Americans to say their economic standing has improved over their lifetime. About as many white working-class Americans say their social and economic standing has improved from their childhood as say it went down (29% vs. 27%, respectively). In contrast, white college-educated Americans are about three times as likely to say their financial circumstances have gotten better than gotten worse (41% vs. 14%, respectively). Equal numbers of white working-class Americans and white college-educated Americans report that their social standing has remained about the same from when they were growing up (44% vs. 44%, respectively). Generational differences in perceptions of economic and social mobility are telling. White working-class seniors are much more likely than those who are younger to report increased economic standing over their lifetime. More than four in ten (41%) white working-class seniors say their financial position improved from childhood compared to no more than three in ten of those age 50 to 64 (24%), age 30 to 49 (30%), and age 18 to 29 (18%). Conversely, white working-class Americans age 50 to 64 are twice as likely as seniors (32% vs. 16%, respectively) to say their economic and social position has diminished. More than half (52%) of young white working-class Americans say their economic circumstances have not changed since childhood. Food Insecurity White working-class Americans are more than twice as likely as white college-educated Americans to report that their household has had to cut back on food or meals in the last 12 months to save money (32% vs. 15%, respectively). White working-class seniors—most likely due to the stabilizing effects of Medicare and Social Security—are about half as likely as every other age group to report that their household has had to cut back on food to save money. Fewer than one in five (19%) white working-class seniors report they had to make cutbacks in food spending, compared to 36% of white working-class Americans under the age of 65. “I buy the dented cans at the grocery store because they’re cheaper. I find those places, I find the places to get the best deals on things. And I don’t think anybody in Washington today would be able to do what we do as far as living a life.” —Woman Ability to Handle Emergency Expenses Reflecting their current financial status, white working-class Americans are more than twice as likely as white college-educated Americans to report that they would struggle to pay a $400 emergency expense. Nearly six in ten white working-class Americans say making an emergency payment of $400 would be somewhat difficult (25%), very difficult (17%), or nearly impossible (15%). Roughly four in ten (43%) white working-class Americans say making such a payment would not be very difficult. In sharp contrast, fewer than one-quarter (22%) of white college-educated Americans report they would have at least some difficulty making a $400 expense. The experiences of white working-class Americans more closely resemble those of black and Hispanic Americans than those of white college-educated Americans. Only about four in ten (41%) blacks and one-third (34%) of Hispanic Americans report that it would not be that difficult to pay a $400 emergency expense given their current financial situation. There is a sizable gender divide among white working-class Americans in their capacity to pay an emergency expense. Nearly half (48%) of white working-class men, but only 38% of white working-class women, say it would not be that difficult to pay for a $400 emergency expense.

IV. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Health Insurance Coverage One possible explanation for the differing levels of economic insecurity reported by older and younger white working class Americans may have to do with health insurance coverage. Nearly all (98%) white working-class seniors say they currently have health insurance coverage with the bulk of the coverage (69%) coming from Medicare or Medicaid. In contrast, nearly one in five (19%) white working-class Americans under the age of 65 say they do not currently have health insurance, including one-quarter (25%) of white working-class Americans under 30. “I was born club-footed, and it’s hard for me to stand for certain periods of time. And I [have] such bad depression and anxiety, and they keep turning me down for social security. It’s like you don’t have enough doctor’s appointments. How can I go to [the] doctor’s if I don’t have health insurance? I don’t go to the doctor’s because I have no way to get to the doctor’s, I have no way to pay for it.” – Woman Household Struggles with Alcoholism, Drug Addiction, and Depression Notably, white working-class Americans are twice as likely as white college-educated Americans to say someone in their family has struggled with substance abuse. Similar numbers of white working-class Americans report a family member has struggled with either alcoholism (12%) or drug addiction (8%). Among white college-educated Americans, fewer say someone in their household has struggled with either alcoholism (9%) or drug addiction (3%). Nearly four in ten (38%) white working-class Americans, compared to 26% of white college-educated Americans, say they or someone in their household has experienced depression in the last 12 months. Experience with all three issues, particularly depression, varies considerably within the white working class by financial status. Nearly half (48%) of white working-class Americans who face economic distress­—rating their current financial situation as fair or poor—say a member of their household has battled depression, compared to 21% of white working-class Americans who say they are in excellent or good financial shape. Rates of alcoholism and drug addiction do not differ significantly by financial status within the white working class. White working-class women (43%) are considerably more likely than white working-class men (33%) to say a member of their household has struggled with depression in the last 12 months. However, rates of alcoholism and drug addiction do not differ markedly by gender. Nearly half of white working-class Americans under the age of 30 (45%) and age 50 to 64 (46%) say someone in their household has struggled with depression, compared to just 22% of white working-class Americans age 65 and older. White working-class young adults are also more likely than seniors to report struggling with either alcoholism and excessive drinking (16% vs. 4%, respectively) or drug abuse (13% vs. 3%, respectively). There are notable differences in experiencing these mental health challenges by religious affiliation, with religiously unaffiliated white working-class Americans reporting significantly higher rates of depression. Nearly half (47%) of white working-class Americans who are religiously unaffiliated report that depression is an issue in their household, compared to 38% of white working-class mainline Protestants, 35% of white working-class evangelical Protestants, and 28% of white working-class Catholics. Roughly one in five (19%) white working-class Americans with no religious affiliation report that someone in their household is suffering from alcoholism, compared to roughly one in ten white working-class mainline Protestants (12%), evangelical Protestants (9%), and Catholics (9%). Similarly, religiously unaffiliated white working-class Americans (14%) are more likely than white working-class mainline Protestants (9%), evangelical Protestants (6%), and Catholics (5%) to say a member of their household has struggles with drug addiction. Community Problems: Drugs, Alcohol, Hunger, and Poverty A majority (54%) of white working-class Americans say drug abuse and addiction are major problems in their community.3 Roughly one-third (32%) of white working-class Americans say they are a minor problem, while 13% say they are not a problem at all. Fewer than half (42%) of white college-educated Americans report that drugs are a major problem in their community. Roughly one-third (34%) of white working-class Americans say alcoholism and alcohol abuse are major problems in their community, while 22% of white college-educated Americans say the same. Nearly half (48%) of white working-class Americans say alcoholism is a minor problem and 16% say it is not a problem in their community. A similar number (33%) of white working-class Americans report hunger and poverty are major concerns in their community. About four in ten (41%) white working-class Americans say these are minor problems, and roughly one in four (26%) say these are not problems for their community. Among white college-educated Americans, only 24% say hunger and poverty are major concerns in their community. White working-class women express much greater concern than men about all three types of community problems. More than six in ten (62%) white working-class women—but fewer than half (46%) of white working-class men—say drug abuse and addiction are major problems in their community. Roughly four in ten white working-class women say alcoholism and alcohol abuse (40%) and hunger and poverty (43%) are major problems their communities are facing. Only about one-quarter of white working-class men say the same (27% and 23%, respectively).

V. Civic and Religious Disengagement Engagement in Civic and Social Life About two-thirds of white working-class Americans still live in their hometown (41%) or within a two-hour drive from where they grew up (27%). Fewer than one-third (31%) white working-class Americans now live farther away from their hometown. White college-educated Americans are about half as likely to report living in their hometown with only 21% reporting having stayed. Nearly half (48%) of white college-educated Americans live farther away from their birthplace than a two-hour drive. Most white working-class Americans report spending time with neighbors at least somewhat regularly. A majority (52%) of white working-class Americans socialize with their neighbors at least once a month, the same rate as white college-educated Americans (54%). More than one-quarter (27%) of white working-class Americans say they socialize with people in their neighborhood less often (a few times a year or seldom), while more than one in five (21%) report never spending time with their neighbors socially. “It ain’t like it used to be back in the old days. Everybody said ‘hi’ to everybody. Basically you can’t say ‘hi’ to people anymore—they think you’re out to get them if you’re saying ‘hi,’ waving to them. They look at you like you’re crazy.” —Woman Although most white working-class Americans report socializing with neighbors at least somewhat regularly, substantially fewer say they participate in a local community groups and activities. Three in ten (30%) white working-class Americans say they participate in a sports team, book club, PTA, or neighborhood association at least once a month. Roughly one-third (34%) say they engage in these activities less frequently—a few times a year or seldom—while more than one-third (36%) say they never participate. White college-educated Americans, by contrast, exhibit far greater rates of involvement in community groups. Nearly half (49%) of white college-educated Americans say they participate in a sports team, book club, PTA, or neighborhood association at least monthly; 34% participate a few times a year or less often; and only 16% say they never engage in these activities. “And when I talk about values, I don’t mean necessarily my spiritual or religious values but family, community. Could you really go across the street and ask that neighbor, ‘Can I borrow a cup of milk?’ Which, in my neighborhood, we can, but it’s pretty rare. I don’t know most of my neighbors. Have lived there for quite a long time. When I walk down the street with my dog or over to the pound with my dog, there’s no eye contact.” —Man Religious Attendance Even though roughly three-quarters (74%) of white working-class Americans identify with a religious tradition, they are less connected to religious institutions than Americans overall. Twenty-eight percent of white working-class Americans say they attend services at least once a week, 30% say they attend occasionally (once or twice a month or a few times a year), while more than four in ten (42%) say they seldom or never attend religious services. The pattern is somewhat similar among white college-educated Americans. One-third (33%) of white college-educated Americans say they attend services weekly or more often, while identical numbers report attending once or twice a month or a few times a year (33%), or seldom or never (33%). As with the American public overall, there are distinct differences in the frequency of religious participation among the white working class by age. White working-class seniors are nearly twice as likely as white working-class young adults to attend services at least weekly: 40% vs. 21%, respectively. Nearly half (49%) of white working-class young adults report that they seldom or never attend religious services, while only three in ten (30%) white working-class seniors say the same. White working-class women and men are about equally likely to identify with a religious tradition, but women report being more active in their congregation. Nearly one-third (32%) of white working-class women report attending religious services at least once a week compared to fewer than one-quarter (24%) of men. The extent to which white working-class Americans engage in civic activities is closely associated with their connection to religious communities. White working-class Americans who attend religious services at least weekly are nearly twice as likely to engage in community group activities monthly as those who seldom or never attend services (40% vs. 23%, respectively). More than two-thirds of white working-class Americans who seldom or never attend church say they seldom (21%) or never (47%) participate in non-religious activity groups such as a PTA or sports team.

VI. Pessimism and Fatalism Belief in the American Dream Fewer than half (46%) of white working-class Americans believe the American Dream—if you work hard, you can get ahead—still holds true, while roughly as many (48%) say it was once but is no longer true. Four percent say the American Dream was never a reality. These views stand in sharp contrast to white college-educated Americans, among whom about six in ten (62%) say the American Dream still holds true. Among the general public, half (50%) say the American Dream still holds true, while roughly four in ten (41%) say this dream once held true but does not anymore, and 6% say it never held true. “The middle class can’t survive in today’s economy because there really isn’t a middle class anymore. You’ve got poverty level, and you’ve got your one, two percent. You don’t have a middle class anymore like you had in the ’70s and ’80s. My dad started at Cinco making a buck ten an hour. When he retired he was making $45 an hour. It took him 40 years, but he did it. You can’t find that today; there’s no job that exists like that today.” —Man Interestingly, white working-class men have a more positive outlook about the efficacy of hard work than women. A majority (52%) of white working-class men, compared to 40% of white working-class women, say the American Dream still holds true today. Among white working-class Americans, those approaching retirement age are most pessimistic about the promise of the American Dream. Only about four in ten (41%) white working-class Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 believe the American Dream still holds true, compared to 49% of young adults (ages 18-29), 47% of those between the ages of 30 and 49, and 47% of seniors. Are America’s Best Days Behind Us? Americans are almost evenly split about whether America’s best days are in the past or future: half (50%) say America’s best days are behind us, while nearly as many (48%) say the country’s best days are ahead of us.4 The white working class is decidedly more pessimistic. More than six in ten (61%) white working-class Americans say America’s best days are in the past, while fewer than four in ten (37%) say they are yet to come. Among the white college-educated, the reverse is true: nearly six in ten (57%) believe America’s best days lie ahead, while roughly four in ten (43%) say the nation’s best days are behind us. Notably, in contrast with attitudes about the American Dream, there is virtually no gender divide among the white working class on this question. Roughly six in ten white working-class men (60%) and women (62%) say the nation’s best days are in the past. Is a College Education a Worthwhile Investment? Americans overall are significantly more likely to say that a college education is a smart investment (55%) than to say it is more of a gamble that might not ultimately pay off (43%). White working-class Americans, however, are far more skeptical. A majority (54%) of the white working class view getting a college education as a risky gamble, while 44% say it is a smart investment. This puts them at odds with both white college-educated Americans and with black and Hispanic Americans, who have much more faith in the education system. Majorities of white college-educated Americans (63%), Hispanics (68%), and blacks (56%) believe a college education is a wise investment in the future. White working-class men are more dubious about the value of college educations than white working-class women. More than six in ten (61%) white working-class men say a college education is a gamble that may not pay off in the end, compared to 49% of women. Half (50%) of white working-class women view college as a smart investment. “I feel enslaved by the student debt that I have, and I don’t have a degree, and I feel that any job that I may get I will never pay it off in my lifetime.” —Man There are stark political differences among the white working class in their perspectives on higher education. More than six in ten (61%) white working-class Democrats believe college is ultimately a smart investment—a view held by fewer than half (47%) of white working-class Republicans and only 36% of those who are politically independent. A majority (52%) of white working-class Republicans and more than six in ten (63%) white working-class independents believe a college education is risky venture that may not pay off. The Continuing Decline of White Working Class Communities Few white working-class Americans who still live in their hometown report positive feelings about the direction of their community. Only 17% of white working-class Americans who still live in their hometown believe the quality of life in their hometown has gotten better since their childhood days. Close to half (45%) say the quality of life has gotten worse. Thirty-seven percent say things are about the same as they were when they were young. Even though most white working-class Americans preferred Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, few feel buoyed about the future prospects for their community. Nearly half (47%) of white working-class Americans say even after the election they expect the quality of life in their community will stay about the same, and roughly one in five (19%) say it will likely get worse. Only about one-third (32%) of white working-class Americans say life will improve under the Trump administration. Among white college-educated Americans, most (55%) say the quality of life in their community will remain the same, while roughly one-quarter (26%) say it will get better, and 19% say it will get worse.5 White working-class men are somewhat more hopeful about the future of their communities than women. While similar numbers of white working-class men (48%) and women (47%) say life in their local communities is unlikely to change much at all in the wake of the election, men are more likely than women to say the quality of life in their communities will get better (36% vs. 28%, respectively) and less likely to believe things will get worse (14% vs. 24%, respectively). Notably, white working-class Americans who voted for Donald Trump are significantly more likely than those who voted for Hillary Clinton or another candidate to have a positive outlook about the future of their local community. A majority (52%) of white working-class Trump voters say they expect life in their local community to improve, compared to just 15% of those white working-class voters who supported Clinton or another candidate. Additionally, white working-class voters who supported Clinton or a third-party candidate are more than six times more likely than Trump supporters to say the quality of life in their local community will get worse (33% vs. 5%, respectively). Who Influences U.S. Elections? Nearly two-thirds (64%) of white working-class Americans believe that because elections are largely controlled by the wealthy and big corporations, it does not matter if they vote.6 This view is shared by a majority (57%) of Americans, including roughly six in ten black Americans (59%) and Hispanics (61%). In contrast, only about four in ten (42%) white college-educated Americans believe their vote does not count due to the influence of wealthy people and corporations in politics.

VII. The Authoritarian Impulse The White Working Class and Authoritarianism PRRI’s 2012 study of white working-class Americans, Beyond God and Guns, found that white working-class Americans were much more likely than Americans with a college degree to express a preference for authoritarian traits.7 Using an authoritarian scale based on four questions about preferred childhood traits, a 2016 PRRI study found a similar gap: nearly two-thirds (64%) of white working-class Americans have an authoritarian orientation, including 37% who are classified as “high authoritarian.”8 In contrast, fewer than four in ten (39%) white college-educated Americans have an authoritarian outlook. However, there is considerable diversity among the white working class by age, gender and religious affiliation, and by perceptions of cultural change. Younger white working-class Americans are much less likely than those who are older to express a preference for authoritarian traits. Fewer than half (43%) of white working-class young adults (age 18 to 29) have an authoritarian orientation, compared to about three-quarters (74%) of white working-class seniors (age 65 and older).9 White working-class men are somewhat less likely than women to express an authoritarian orientation. Fifty-eight percent of white working-class men, compared to more than seven in ten (71%) white working-class women, have authoritarian sympathies. Notably, there is no variation in authoritarian orientations between white working-class Americans by income level or self-reported financial security. There are profound differences in the degree to which white working-class Americans prefer authoritarian traits by religious identity. White working-class evangelical Protestants are more than twice as likely to have an authoritarian orientation than those who have no religious affiliation (82% vs. 39%, respectively). A majority (56%) of white working-class evangelical Protestants qualify as “high authoritarian.” Majorities of white working-class Catholics (70%) and mainline Protestants (61%) also hold authoritarian orientations. White working-class Americans who express concerns about the changing cultural landscape, such as the influence of immigrants, are much more likely to value authoritarian traits. More than seven in ten (71%) white working-class Americans who believe immigrants are a burden on American society have an authoritarian orientation. In contrast, fewer than half (49%) of those who believe immigrants strengthen American society have an authoritarian disposition. Yearning for a Leader Willing to Break the Rules Americans are closely divided over whether the country needs a strong leader who is willing to break the rules in order to bring about needed reforms. Nearly half (49%) say things have gotten so far off track that we need a strong leader who is willing to break the rules if that is what it takes to set things right, while 50% disagree.10 Authoritarian-style leadership is much more attractive to white working-class Americans than to white college-educated Americans. Six in ten (60%) white working-class Americans, compared to only 32% of white college-educated Americans say we need such a strong leader; two-thirds (67%) of white college-educated Americans disagree. There is significant disagreement by age. Roughly two-thirds (66%) of white working-class seniors, compared to roughly half (52%) of white working-class young adults, say the country needs a leader who is willing to break the rules. White working-class Christians across denominations are about equally as likely to express a preference for a leader willing to defy the standards of conduct, including approximately six in ten evangelical Protestants (63%), mainline Protestants (62%), and Catholics (67%). White working-class Americans who are religiously unaffiliated are far less likely to say such a leader is desirable (42%). “One of two things are gonna happen: Either he’s gonna bring in drastically good policies, and they are going to work beyond what people expected them to, or they’re gonna crash and burn and everybody’s gonna say, ‘Okay, we know not to do that again next time.’” —Man White working-class Americans who express concern about immigrants are more likely to agree the U.S. needs a leader willing to disregard the rules. Two-thirds (67%) of white working-class Americans who believe immigrants are a burden on society say the country needs such a leader. In contrast, fewer than half (48%) of white working-class Americans who believe immigrants strengthen the country agree. Notably, the economic circumstances of white working-class Americans appear to have little influence on their preference for a rule-breaking leader. White working-class Americans who say they are in good or excellent financial shape express as much support for a leader who is willing to break the rules as those in only fair or poor shape (58% vs. 60%, respectively). White working-class Americans who have more authoritarian leanings—are classified as either high authoritarian or authoritarian—are significantly more likely to embrace a leader who wants to upend the rules. Two-thirds (67%) of white working-class Americans with an authoritarian orientation say the country needs a candidate who is willing to defy convention and break the rules, while only 39% of white working-class Americans with an autonomous orientation agree.

VIII. Race, Gender, and Cultural Change Fears about the Changing Culture Landscape Americans are roughly evenly divided over whether American culture and way of life has changed for the better (48%) or for the worse (51%) since the 1950s.11 The belief that American culture has been degraded is felt strongly among the white working class. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of white working-class Americans believe the American way of life has deteriorated since the 1950s. Only about one-third (34%) of white working-class Americans believe American culture has improved. This view is sharply at odds with white college-educated Americans, a majority (56%) of whom say that American culture and way of life has improved. “Family values in general have gone to complete shit since the 1950s, the best way to put it.” —Woman There is a notable generational divide among white working-class Americans about the direction of the country since the mid-century mark. Young white working-class Americans are considerably less likely than seniors to say American culture has changed for the worse (54% vs. 65%, respectively). More than four in ten (44%) young white working-class Americans say the American way of life has improved since the mid-century. One concern that white working-class Americans express about how American culture has shifted is fear the country is losing its identity. More than two-thirds (68%) of white working-class Americans—along with a majority (55%) of the public overall—believe the U.S. is in danger of losing its culture and identity. Notably, fewer than half (41%) of white college-educated Americans agree the country is at risk of losing its identity. On this question, there is broad agreement among white working-class Americans that cuts across regional and generational lines. Among white working-class Americans of different religious backgrounds there are notable differences in the degree of concern about America’s cultural identity. Nearly eight in ten (79%) white working-class evangelical Protestants express fear that the country is losing its culture and identity, compared to 56% of those who are religiously unaffiliated. “It just seems like it’s gotten to the point where if you don’t agree with me or I don’t agree with you, we look at each other as wrong. And how did that become that way? How did your opinion become wrong? Everybody has an opinion about life and living, and all of a sudden it’s wrong.” —Woman For many white working-class Americans, the pace of cultural change has left them wondering about whether and where they fit in American society. Nearly half (48%) of white working-class Americans say, “things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.” Slightly more than half (51%) of white working-class Americans disagree. In contrast, only about one-quarter (26%) of white college-educated Americans report they often feel like a stranger, while nearly three-quarters (74%) reject the notion. There is a substantial generational division among white working-class Americans in how they feel in relation to their country. Only about four in ten (42%) white working-class Americans under age 50 say they often feel like a stranger in their own country, while a slim majority (52%) of age 50 or older express this sentiment. Protecting American Culture Overwhelmingly, white working-class Americans believe the American way of life needs to be protected from foreign influence. Nearly seven in ten (68%) white working-class Americans express this view, while only 29% disagree. In contrast, fewer than half (44%) of white college-educated Americans—and a majority (55%) of the general public—also embrace this idea. Consistent with previous patterns of opinion, the white working class has strong generational divisions in the perception of American society’s need to be protected from cultural encroachment. White working-class Americans under age 50 are much less likely to see a need to protect American way of life than those who are at least 50 years of age (52% vs. 79%, respectively). One response to the prevailing concern about a shifting landscape in the U.S. was to view the 2016 election as the last opportunity to push back against the tide of cultural and demographic change. For nearly half (49%) of white working-class Americans, the 2016 election represented the “last chance to stop America’s decline.” Roughly as many (50%) white working-class Americans disagree with this statement. Relatively few (27%) white college-educated Americans saw the 2016 election as the last chance to arrest America’s decline.12 Race, Discrimination, and Diversity More than half (52%) of white working-class Americans believe discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities. Forty-six percent disagree. White college-educated Americans are sharply at odds with the white working class on this question: seven in ten (70%) say they do not believe discrimination against whites is comparable to that faced by non-whites. There are no differences of opinion among white working-class Americans by gender or region, but sizable generational disagreement exists. Younger white working-class Americans largely disagree discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities. While only four in ten (40%) white working-class Americans under age 40 say “reverse discrimination” is an equally significant problem as discrimination against minority groups, nearly six in ten (59%) white working-class seniors (age 65 and older) believe it is. A majority (57%) of white working-class Americans under age 40 reject this idea. “We’re supposed to make the effort to include everybody else. They don’t have to make the effort to include us. I was hysterical laughing over the thing at Eastern Kentucky University. The black student body had a welcome black event. Well, somebody on campus thought they should have a white welcome event. Well, the black one was okay, but the white one, the whole campus went bananas, and it was racist. Now what is the difference?” —Woman When it comes to efforts aimed at increasing diversity, most white working-class Americans do not believe it is a zero-sum proposition. A majority (56%) of white working-class Americans reject the idea that “efforts to increase diversity almost always come at the expense of whites.” However, a sizable minority—four in ten (40%)—of white working-class Americans agree with this statement. In contrast, fewer than one-quarter (24%) of white college-educated Americans believe efforts at increasing diversity inherently mean whites will lose out. White working-class men are particularly likely to believe whites lose out when efforts are undertaken to increase diversity. Nearly half (47%) of white working-class men, compared to only one-third (33%) of white working-class women, agree that diversity generally comes at the expense of whites. Who Faces Discrimination in the U.S.? Despite concerns about demographic change and a shifting cultural landscape, white working-class Americans are roughly as likely as Americans overall to believe many minority groups face substantial discrimination in society. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of white working-class Americans believe Muslims face a lot of discrimination in the U.S. A majority believe transgender people (61%), immigrants (59%), gay and lesbian people (56%), and blacks (54%) experience a lot of discrimination. Conversely, fewer than half of white working-class Americans say Christians (40%) and whites (38%) are facing a considerable degree of discrimination in society. However, perceptions of discrimination among white working-class Americans vary considerably by age. Young white working-class Americans are far more likely than seniors to say that immigrants (82% vs. 43%, respectively), Muslims (79% vs. 51%, respectively), gay and lesbian people (68% vs. 45%, respectively), transgender people (70% vs. 48%, respectively), and blacks (67% vs. 46%, respectively) are experiencing a lot of discrimination in American society. There is greater agreement among young white working-class Americans and seniors about whether whites (35% vs. 32%, respectively) and Christians (36% vs. 42%, respectively) are facing a lot of discrimination. Immigrants and Immigration Americans overall are split over immigrants’ cultural influence. Close to half (46%) believe the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens traditional American customs and values, while approximately as many (44%) believe the growing number of newcomers strengthens American society.13 White working-class Americans are much less divided in their opinion of immigrants. More than six in ten (62%) white working-class Americans believe the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens American culture, while fewer than one-third (30%) disagree. The views of white college-educated Americans are nearly reversed, with a majority (54%) expressing the view that immigrants strengthen the country. “My fiancé’s worked for the same company for 21 years, and it’s a union [job], and they are hiring Mexicans. And I don’t want to be racial, but that’s all that they’re hiring. He makes like $31 an hour, and they’re coming in at making like $8 an hour.” —Woman Views diverge sharply by region. More than six in ten white working-class Americans living in the Northeast (66%), Midwest (62%), and South (68%) believe immigrants constitute a threat to American culture. In contrast, fewer than half (49%) of white working-class Americans in the western U.S. believe newcomers are threatening American customs. Despite expressing largely negative views of immigrants, most white working-class Americans remain committed to a policy that would grant immigrants living in the U.S. illegally an option to become citizens. Nearly six in ten (59%) white working-class Americans believe immigrants living in the country illegally should be allowed to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements—only slightly lower than support among the general public (63%). One in ten (10%) say they should be granted permanent residency status, but denied full citizenship. More than one in four (27%) white working-class Americans support identifying and deporting immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally. There are modest gender divisions among the white working class, with more women than men expressing greater support for immigration reform that allows immigrants living in the U.S. illegally an opportunity to become U.S. citizens (65% vs. 53%, respectively). Nearly one-third (32%) of white working-class men say their preferred immigration policy would be to deport all immigrants living in the country unlawfully, a view shared by fewer than one-quarter (23%) of white working-class women. Gender Roles When it comes to women’s role in politics, white working-class Americans are divided. While most of the public (58%) and seven in ten (70%) white college-educated Americans believe the country would be better off if more women held political office, roughly half (48%) of white working-class Americans agree the country would be better off and just as many (49%) disagree. Notably, the gender difference is more modest among white working-class Americans than among whites with a college education.14 Fewer than half (43%) of white working-class men, compared to a majority (53%) of white working-class women, believe the country would benefit from female leadership in politics. The divide among white college-educated Americans is even more pronounced, although majorities of both white college-educated men (56%) and women (82%) agree with this statement. More white working-class Americans reject the idea that society punishes men for “acting like men” than embrace it (51% vs. 38%, respectively), but there are substantial differences of opinion between men and women. White working-class men are more likely than women to believe society punishes men just for acting like men. Close to half of white working-class men (45%), compared to only about one-third of white working-class women (32%), agree society punishes men for behaving in traditionally masculine ways. Americans overall largely reject the idea that American society has become too soft and feminine. A majority (53%) of the public disagrees that society has become overly feminine, compared to about four in ten (42%) who agree. White working-class Americans overall are more divided, with nearly half (47%) in agreement that American society has become too soft. A roughly similar number (48%) disagree that contemporary society is too soft and feminine. White working-class men stand out for the degree to which they agree that society has become too soft and feminine. More than six in ten (61%) white working-class men embrace the notion that society has become too feminine, while only about one-third (35%) of white working-class women agree. Overall, white working-class Americans are far more likely than white college-educated Americans to believe society has become too soften and feminine (47% vs. 29%, respectively). Notably, white college-educated men are also more likely than women to agree society has become too feminine (40% vs. 20%, respectively).

IX. Economic Policy and Trade White working-class Americans generally believe the economic system is stacked against them, are broadly supportive of populist economic policies such as raising the minimum wage and taxing the wealthy—including a larger role for government—and are skeptical of free trade. However, they tend to mirror Americans overall rather than standing out as particularly populist. Fairness of the Economic System Most white working-class Americans believe the economic system unfairly favors the wealthy, a view shared by many Americans. Seven in ten (70%) white working-class Americans agree with this sentiment, compared to roughly two-thirds of Americans overall (68%) and white college-educated (68%) Americans. More than three-quarters (76%) of black Americans and six in ten (63%) Hispanic Americans also express this view. Raising the Minimum Wage and Taxing the Wealthy A majority (53%) of the white working class favors raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour, while more than four in ten (44%) are opposed. Six in ten (60%) white working-class women want to see an increase in the minimum wage, comparable to attitudes among the public (60%). However, fewer than half (45%) of white working-class men agree. Half (50%) say they oppose a $15 minimum wage. White college-educated Americans are fairly divided over the issue, with about as many expressing support (52%) as opposition (45%). White working class support for increasing the minimum wage is particularly tepid when compared to black and Hispanic Americans, who overwhelmingly favor this policy. Roughly eight in ten black (82%) and Hispanic (77%) Americans favor raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Notably, fewer than half (48%) of young white working-class Americans favor a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour. More than half (51%) oppose it. The level of support among young white working-class Americans mirrors that among white working-class seniors—half (50%) favor an increase, while 44% oppose it. “I’m tired of the minimum wage being offered so low it makes it impossible to provide for your family no matter how hard you break your back.” —Woman Party differences among the white working class are particularly pronounced. Only one-third (33%) of white working-class Republicans say they would be in favor of raising the minimum wage, while more than six in ten (63%) are opposed. White working-class Democrats, in contrast, overwhelmingly support this policy, with more than three-quarters (78%) saying they are in favor. White working-class independents mirror the white working class overall on this issue. There is more robust support among white working-class Americans for raising the tax rate on Americans making over $250,000 a year. Nearly six in ten (58%) members of the white working-class favor increasing the tax rate for wealthy households, similar to the level of support found among the general public (57%) and white college-educated Americans (58%). Interestingly, differences exist between black and Hispanic Americans’ views on increasing taxes on the wealthy. Like white working-class Americans, blacks express robust support for a tax hike on those making $250,000 a year or more, while Hispanic Americans are less inclined to support such a policy (63% vs. 51%, respectively). Similar divisions among white working-class Americans emerge by gender. White working-class women express greater support for increasing taxes on those earning more than $250,000 per year than men (62% vs. 54%, respectively). Welfare (and Race) Although white working-class Americans tend to favor an increase in the minimum wage and raising the tax rate on wealthy families, most take a dim view of people who receive welfare payments. A majority (54%) of white working-class Americans say people who receive welfare payments are taking advantage of the system, while approximately one-third (36%) say they are genuinely in need of help. The white working class stands in sharp contrast to Americans overall, their white college-educated counterparts, and both black and Hispanic Americans. The general public is divided on this issue, with 46% saying most welfare recipients are in need of help and 44% saying most are playing the system. The views of Hispanic Americans are similar, with roughly as many believing welfare recipients need help (46%) as believing they are taking advantage (45%). Roughly six in ten white college-educated Americans (59%) and black Americans (61%) say most people on welfare have genuine need, while approximately three in ten take the opposing view (32% and 30%, respectively). There are few differences among the white working class by religion, gender, or region. However, political divisions are notable: nearly two-thirds (65%) of white working-class Republicans say most people on welfare are abusing the system, while a slim majority (51%) of white working-class Democrats say most people on welfare need the help. White working-class independents largely mirror the white working class overall. There is sharp generational disagreement among the white working class about the social welfare system. Nearly half (49%) of young white working-class Americans believe people who receive welfare payments are genuinely in need of assistance, while roughly as many (46%) say they are abusing the system. In contrast, only about one-third (34%) of white working-class seniors believe people receiving welfare need help, while a majority (53%) say they are taking advantage of the system. There is some evidence attitudes about welfare, particularly among white working-class Americans, are closely tied to race.15 White working-class Americans who say they live in neighborhoods where the majority of lower-income people are non-white are more likely to believe there is widespread fraud or abuse in the welfare system than those living in areas where poor people are mostly white. More than six in ten (63%) white working-class Americans who report living in areas where poor people are predominantly black believe people on welfare are abusing the system. In contrast, roughly half (52%) of white working-class Americans who report that most poor people in their communities are white believe people who receive welfare are abusing the system, while 35% say they need help. White college-educated Americans in both types of communities reported similar views of people on welfare. Infrastructure and Free Trade Most (53%) white working-class Americans believe the best way to promote economic growth is to increase spending on education and the nation’s infrastructure, while raising taxes on wealthy individuals and businesses to pay for it.16 About four in ten (41%) prefer lowering taxes on individuals and businesses and paying for those tax cuts by cutting spending on some government services and programs. White working-class attitudes on this issue are roughly in line with white college-educated Americans, but they are less likely than black and Hispanic Americans to endorse increased spending on education and infrastructure. Nationally, 56% of Americans favor more infrastructure spending, as do 53% of white college-educated people. Roughly three-quarters (74%) of black Americans and nearly two-thirds (65%) of Hispanic Americans believe economic growth is spurred through increased spending on infrastructure. The gender divide persists in views about funding infrastructure projects and education. White working-class women are slightly more likely than men to believe investments in education and infrastructure are a better way to promote growth (57% vs. 49%, respectively). One issue where white working-class Americans stand out from other Americans is free trade. Six in ten (60%) white working-class people say free trade agreements with other countries are mostly harmful because they send jobs overseas and drive down wages, while one-third (33%) say they are mostly helpful because they open markets for U.S. companies and allow Americans to buy goods more cheaply. Americans overall are more divided on the benefits of trade. Half (50%) of Americans say free trade deals are mostly harmful rather than mostly helpful (43%).17 White college-educated Americans similarly are divided, but somewhat more likely to say free trade is helpful (49%) rather than harmful (42%). Among white working-class Americans there is a considerable generational divide in views about free trade. Young white working-class Americans are divided over whether free trade is mostly harmful because it sends American jobs overseas and lowers wages (46%) or whether it is mostly helpful because it allows Americans to buy goods more cheaply (42%). Six in ten (60%) white working-class seniors believe free trade is harmful because it sends American jobs overseas.

X. Criminal Justice and Drug Policy Treatment vs. Jail Time for Drug Users White working-class Americans—and the public overall—are strongly supportive of requiring drug treatment rather than jail time for drug users after a first or second offense. Approximately seven in ten (71%) white working-class Americans and three-quarters (74%) of the public believe drug treatment is preferable to prison for those using illegal drugs. More than eight in ten (82%) white college-educated Americans also support a treatment option over incarceration. Drug treatment is the preferred option among an overwhelming number of black (78%) and Hispanic (67%) Americans. “You don’t see anyone smoking marijuana and going out and shooting people, number one. Generally it’s not a drunk driving. They’re sitting at home with a bag of Fritos, and they’re too tired to do anything. And it’s doing amazing things medically, so why are we still fighting it? And the war on drugs hasn’t done squat for us, so we need to figure out another plan.” —Woman Felon Voting Rights There is equally strong support among white working-class Americans for the restoration of voting rights for felons. More than seven in ten (71%) white working-class Americans and about three-quarters (74%) of the public overall agree a person who has been convicted of a felony should be allowed to vote after they have served their sentence; about one-quarter (26%) of Americans disagree.18 There is no gender divide among the white working class, but there is a vast generational gap. Nearly eight in ten (78%) white working-class young adults (age 18-29) say a person convicted of a felony should have their voting rights restored after serving their sentence, compared to roughly six in ten (59%) white working-class seniors (age 65 and older). White working-class support for restoring voting rights to felons also varies somewhat by region. Two-thirds (67%) of white working-class Southerners believe felons should be allowed to vote after serving their sentences, while 70% of those in the Midwest, 73% of those in the Northeast, and 76% of those in the West agree.

XI. Understanding the White Working Class Vote in 2016 A post-election survey conducted by PRRI just days after the election found nearly two-thirds (64%) of white working-class voters reported supporting President Trump in the 2016 presidential election, while fewer than one-third (32%) said they cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton.19 A number of explanations were offered to help explain Trump’s rise and unlikely victory in 2016, with many of them focused particularly on his strong performance among white working-class voters. “My dad specifically told me when he voted for Obama, the only reason he voted for Obama was because of his promise for change. This time he voted for Hillary and we’ve been fighting ever since. I said, ‘Where do you think you’re gonna get change with her? Just tell me one thing that you think she’s gonna change.’” —Man Some of the most prominent factors identified by journalists and scholars include: lack of social mobility, economic distress, poor health outcomes, civic disengagement, racial resentment, anxiety about cultural change, anti-immigrant sentiment, and anxiety about shifting gender roles. However, survey results demonstrate no evidence for several leading theories. White working-class voters who experienced a loss of social and economic standing were not any more likely favor Trump than those whose status remained the same or improved.

White working-class voters who reported that someone in their household was dealing with a health issue—such as drug addiction, alcohol abuse, or depression—were actually less likely to express support for Trump’s candidacy.

There is no correlation between the level of civic engagement and preference for Trump among white working-class voters. Still, many factors remain correlated with support for Trump’s candidacy among white working-class voters. White working-class voters who said discrimination against whites is a serious problem were much more likely to favor Trump than those who did not (74% vs. 40%, respectively).

Similarly, white working-class voters who expressed anxieties about cultural change—a composite variable that combined a belief that the U.S. needs to be protected from foreign influence and feelings of being “a stranger in my own country”—expressed a much stronger preference for Trump than those who did not (79% vs. 43%, respectively).

White working-class voters who advocated deporting immigrants living in the country illegally overwhelmingly favored Trump, while those who favored alternative policies expressed far less support (87% vs. 49%, respectively).

Roughly three-quarters (74%) of white working-class voters who say society punishes men “just for acting like men” supported Trump, compared to 48% of those who reject this statement. Independent Predictors of Support for Donald Trump Among White Working-Class Americans In order to sort out which attributes, attitudes, and experiences mattered most in predicting support for Trump among working-class voters, we constructed a multivariate logistic regression model.20 The model included a variety of demographic traits such as gender, age, region, hometown residence, Republican identity, and evangelical Protestant identity. The model also tested two measures of civic engagement: frequency of worship attendance (seldom or never) and frequency of civic engagement (seldom or never). Additionally, the model tested a variety of measures of cultural anxiety: beliefs about whether changing gender roles disadvantage men, perceptions of reverse discrimination, anxieties about cultural change, support for deporting immigrants, and negative views of Muslims. Finally, the model also included measures of economic anxiety, including adverse health outcomes, a belief that education is a gamble, the perception of being in poor financial shape, and perceived downward socioeconomic mobility. Overall, the model demonstrates that besides partisanship, fears about immigrants and cultural displacement were more powerful factors than economic concerns in predicting support for Trump among white working-class voters. Moreover, the effects of economic concerns were complex—with economic fatalism predicting support for Trump, but economic hardship predicting support for Clinton. Identification with the Republican Party. Identifying as Republican, not surprisingly, was strongly predictive of Trump support. White working-class voters who identified as Republican were 11 times more likely to support Trump than those who did not identify as Republican. No other demographic attribute was significant. Fears about cultural displacement. White working-class voters who say they often feel like a stranger in their own land and who believe the U.S. needs protecting against foreign influence were 3.5 times more likely to favor Trump than those who did not share these concerns. Support for deporting immigrants living in the country illegally. White working-class voters who favored deporting immigrants living in the country illegally were 3.3 times more likely to express a preference for Trump than those who did not. Economic fatalism. White working-class voters who said that college education is a gamble were almost twice as likely to express a preference for Trump as those who said it was an important investment in the future.21 Economic hardship. Notably, while only marginally significant at conventional levels (P<0.1), being in fair or poor financial shape actually predicted support for Hillary Clinton among white working-class Americans, rather than support for Donald Trump. Those who reported being in fair or poor financial shape were 1.7 times more likely to support Clinton, compared to those who were in better financial shape.22

It is notable that many attitudes and attributes identified as possible explanations for Trump’s support among white working-class voters were not significant independent predictors. Gender, age, region, and religious affiliation were not significant demographic factors in the model. Views about gender roles and attitudes about race were also not significant. It is also notable that neither measure of civic engagement—attendance at civic events or religious services—proved to be a significant independent predictor of support for Trump."

In particular, he used the NAS report to support his claim that the American economy is hurt by immigrants.

Here is his reference to the report, in context (emphasis added):

The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others — have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.”

As the chair of the panel of scientists convened to write that report and one of the consultants who analyzed the effect of immigration on government budgets, we can state unequivocally that this was not our conclusion. Our report looked at the evidence from all sides and found that the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration are generally positive, or at least not likely to be negative. How, then, can the report be used to argue the opposite?

It’s possible precisely because we did examine the evidence from all sides. President Trump took advantage of a rhetorical vulnerability inherent in scientific evaluation: Because we presented evidence from an array of sources, someone who seeks to support a particular position can dig out findings or statistics to support the conclusion he or she prefers. President Trump, or his speechwriters, cherry-picked some of our results related to government budgets and ignored the overall positive impact that immigrants have on our economy (a positive impact that in turn supports the health of public finances). To redress the imbalance, we provide a more comprehensive summary here.

The panel was convened to address a very complex question: What are the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration? This is a difficult question because immigration affects virtually every aspect of the economy and, moreover, because outcomes may vary across time and place. Such temporal and regional differences may reflect the size of immigrant inflows, the characteristics of natives and incoming immigrants, and prevailing economic conditions. Further, some processes (such as the expense of educating the school-age children of immigrants) are set in motion immediately upon immigrant arrival, while others (such as the labor market and fiscal returns on that investment when the child becomes a working adult) unfold over many years. Our panel gathered the evidence, looked at the data, and sought to do justice to the full range and complexity of the issues. Here are some of our major findings.

Immigrants are more skilled and educated than you probably think

First of all, many of us have an outdated idea of the level and kind of immigration occurring today. Since the 1990s, more immigrants have been arriving every year — but the size of these flows relative to the total population has stabilized. Moreover, the new arrivals, though still less educated on average compared with native-born persons, are more educated and come from a more diverse set of countries of origin than the immigrants arriving at the end of the 20th century (see the chart below for the educational distribution of recent immigrants over time). Indeed, today’s immigrants are more likely to have education beyond college than the native-born.

That observation includes both legally authorized and unauthorized immigrants. Conventional data sources do not permit us to break this down further, but some data is available on the unauthorized immigrants; and here, too, many of us have inaccurate views, particularly relating to how large these flows are. The population of unauthorized immigrants has indeed increased, almost doubling since 1995, to a total of about 11 million today. However, the annual net inflow of new unauthorized immigrants has essentially stopped since 2009: It’s been at or below zero since that year, according to the Pew Research Center.

What about impacts on wages and employment? Over all, when measured over a period of 10 years or more, there is little evidence of a negative effect of immigration on the wages or employment of natives overall. When there was evidence of negative impacts, they were mostly visited upon prior immigrants and those natives with the lowest levels of skills and education — those lacking a high school degree. This is likely the section of the report referred to in the president’s speech, but even here the research produced a range of evidence and was far from unanimous in finding negative effects.

The panel looked across the relevant studies at estimates of what would happen to the wages of the least educated native-born Americans if immigration raised the total supply of labor in the US by 1 percent. Those studies came to a range of conclusions —from a decrease in the wages of these workers of 1.7 percent to no effect to a modestly positive increase of 0.1 percent. What’s more, while not an issue examined directly by our panel, most research suggests that the primary source of worsening wage outcomes for the lowest skilled among US workers is technological change, not immigration.

No evidence of a penalty for native-born workers with a high school degree

Moreover, we found virtually no indication that immigration adversely affected the wages or employment of native-born, high school–educated workers, the people whose economic problems are sometimes pointed to as a reason for curbing immigration — and whose economic angst played a part in fueling Trump’s successful presidential bid. Again, the major reason for negative trends for this group appears to be technological change. A more surefire strategy to raise wages of less skilled workers than restricting immigration is to raise their skill levels by investing more in education and training.

Our report also found that immigration produced many concrete economic benefits. A strongly supported finding of the report is that immigration is integral to the nation’s economic growth. The inflow of labor supplied by immigrants has helped the United States avoid the problems of other economies, such as Japan’s, that have stagnated as a result of unfavorable demographics — particularly the effects of an aging workforce and reduced consumption of housing and other durable goods by older residents.

In addition, the infusion of human capital by high-skilled immigrants has boosted the nation’s capacity for innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological change. Research suggests, for example, that immigrants to the US have substantially raised the number of patents granted per capita, which ultimately contributes to productivity growth. The prospects for long-run growth in the United States would be considerably dimmed without the contributions of high-skilled immigrants.

Moreover, in shutting the doors to lower-skilled immigrants, the nation would lose their many economic contributions, such as their role in making goods and services like child care, house cleaning and repair, food preparation, and construction more available and affordable.

The question of whether immigration costs native-born taxpayers extra is trickier

How do these impacts on economic growth relate to the question of how immigration affects taxpayers? In general, the stronger economic growth is, the healthier government budgets are: Tax revenues go up as incomes and profits rise, and expenditures on need-based public programs go down. We would be sacrificing these benefits if we did not have immigration. But what of the narrower issue of whether immigrants receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes right now? Setting aside their contributions to overall growth, are immigrants a fiscal boon or burden?

It is important to consider this question in context. We are a debtor nation — that’s what the existence of the widely discussed budget deficit means. This in turn means that the “average American” is a fiscal burden, receiving more in benefits than he or she pays in taxes. Thus, our report includes estimates suggesting that a fiscal shortfall exists for both natives and immigrants. From that narrow perspective, President Trump’s reference was not technically in error — but it was misleading because he neglected to mention there is also a shortfall for the native-born as well as immigrants.

Whether immigrants are an even worse deal than natives for government budgets depends on how we account for government spending on things that do not necessarily cost the government more to provide when the population increases — notably, defense spending and interest payments on the debt.

If these costs are attributed equally to immigrants and natives on a per capita basis, immigrants appear costlier to government budgets than do the native-born. Our analysis of the data under this assumption found that immigrants accounted for 17.6 percent of the population and 22.4 percent of the deficit; in contrast, natives accounted for 82.4 percent of the population and 77.6 percent of the deficit.

However, if the costs of items like national defense and interest payments on the debt are excluded for immigrants, on the rationale that an additional immigrant does not cause these costs to increase, the results are different. Under that assumption, immigrants instead help native taxpayers by sharing the burden of paying for these collective costs while not increasing their level.

Here’s one way to think about this kind of government spending, which plays a central part in our analysis: Deporting immigrants or reducing annual quotas would probably not reduce defense spending or interest payments, so such a policy would not lift the burden that foes of immigration say non-immigrants are bearing. Indeed, natives would be negatively affected to the extent that they would have fewer people to share those costs with.

States may bear some costs that the federal government later recoups — an argument for fairer cost sharing, not immigration restrictions

When thinking about fiscal impacts, it is also important to realize that a snapshot of today gives a limited picture. That is why the report also looked at tax and benefit flows over time, observing an immigrant from arrival and projecting his taxes and benefits and that of his or her descendants over the next 75 years. From this perspective, does the arrival of an additional immigrant help or hurt?

Again, the answer depends on what we consider the costs of an immigrant, but it also depends on future government budgets and the characteristics of future immigrants. In most of the scenarios in the report, immigrants and their descendants are a net fiscal benefit. Indeed, second-generation children are fiscal powerhouses, out-earning and out-contributing their native-born peers. The nation’s investment in public education and other services for them is more than paid back over time.

The tax partnership between the federal and local levels of government deserves some attention here, because of the asymmetry of costs and benefits. More of the long-run fiscal benefits of immigrants accrue to the federal Treasury through the tax payments of adult immigrants and their grown children. In contrast, more of the short-run costs of immigrants are borne at the state and local level, principally in the form of education expenses for their children that train more productive workers and taxpayers for the future. This creates a disconnect in time between the local costs (sooner) and the federal benefits (later).

Policymakers should recognize that in high-immigration states, the costs of educating the children of immigrants could have negative impacts on state and local government budgets. Because the federal Treasury will later benefit from this, a larger federal role in shouldering these costs might make sense.

Finally, the historical data showing that immigrant flows are becoming better educated — as educational attainment rises in immigrant-sending regions — is relevant to fiscal impacts. If this trend continues, the fiscal impacts of foreign-born persons relative to natives will likely continue to improve.

In short, the panel’s comprehensive examination of the data on this contentious subject revealed many important benefits of immigration — including on economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship. And it found little to no negative effects on the overall wages or employment of native-born workers in the long term. Where negative wage impacts have been detected, native-born high school dropouts and prior immigrants are most likely to be affected. But even there, the evidence is far from unanimous in finding negative effects for natives.

The fiscal picture is more complex, and depends in part on how one allocates costs associated with government expenditure on defense and the national debt. Under a reasonable scenario in which those costs are not attributed to immigrants, immigrants are a fiscal boon overall, but there are negative effects evident at the state level when the costs of educating the children of immigrants are included.

On the other hand — importantly — these children of immigrants go on to become some of the most positive fiscal contributors in the population.

In the months leading up to Election Day, a heated debate broke out among political commentators over the source of Donald Trump’s support. Was it driven primarily by economic anxiety, as the early conventional wisdom often argued, or more by racism and other cultural factors?

The debate has continued in the weeks since Trump’s win, and lately the anxiety skeptics seem to be gaining the upper hand. Numerous writers, including some on this website, have noted that obvious measures of economic struggle such as poverty and unemployment were poor predictors of Trump support; indeed, exit polls show that Hillary Clinton won handily among poorer Americans. And whereas in 2012 Mitt Romney won among voters who considered the economy their top issue, Trump lost such voters. Measures of racism and sexism, and markers of social status such as a college degree, did a much better job predicting whom voters would support.

Correctly assessing the forces that led to Trump’s victory is more than an academic exercise. It’s central to figuring out what happens next — what Trump’s supporters expect him to do, what Democratic counter-measures would be effective, what metrics we should use to gauge his success. But the recent debate has missed an important distinction: Economic anxiety is not the same thing as economic hardship. And the evidence suggests that anxiety did play a key role in Trump’s victory, though it was by no means the only factor.

What’s the difference between hardship and anxiety? Hardship, as I’m using it here, refers to a person’s present-day economic struggles: poverty, joblessness, falling wages, foreclosure, bankruptcy. Anxiety is all about what lies ahead — concerns about saving for retirement or college, worry of a potential layoff, fears that your children’s prospects aren’t as bright as your own were.

Economic hardship doesn’t explain Trump’s support. In fact, quite the opposite: Clinton easily won most low-income areas. But anxiety is a different story. Trump, as FiveThirtyEight contributor Jed Kolko noted immediately after the election, won most counties — and improved on Romney’s performance — where a large share of jobs are vulnerable to outsourcing or automation. And while there is no standard measure of economic anxiety, a wide range of other plausible proxies shows the same pattern. According to my own analysis of voting data, for example, the slower a county’s job growth has been since 2007, the more it shifted toward Trump. (The same is true looking back to 2000.) And of course Trump performed especially strongly among voters without a college degree — an important indicator of social status but also of economic prospects, given the shrinking share of jobs (and especially well-paying jobs) available to workers without a bachelor’s degree.

The role of economic anxiety becomes even clearer in the data once you control for race. Black and Hispanic Americans tend both to be poorer and to face worse economic prospects than non-Hispanic whites, but they also had strong non-economic reasons to vote against Trump, who had a history of making racist comments. Factoring in the strong opposition to Trump among most racial and ethnic minorities, Trump significantly outperformed Romney in counties where residents had lower credit scores and in counties where more men have stopped working.

The list goes on: More subprime loans? More Trump support. More residents receiving disability payments? More Trump support. Lower earnings among full-time workers? More Trump support. “Trump Country,” as my colleague Andrew Flowers described it shortly after the election, isn’t the part of America where people are in the worst financial shape; it’s the part of America where their economic prospects are on the steepest decline.

Teasing out cause and effect, of course, can be tricky, especially given that issues of race, economic status, education and social standing are so tightly linked in American society. But the economic anxiety explanation is consistent with what Trump supporters have been saying all along. More than a year ago, I visited Scott County, Iowa, where the unemployment rate was then 4.3 percent (it was an even lower 4.1 percent on Election Day). Nearly all the people I spoke to there were satisfied with their immediate economic situation. But when the conversation turned to the future, they were far more pessimistic.

“This is a county that 40 years ago, you could go to college and you’d be set for life, or you could come out of high school and get a job at Deere or Case or wherever and also be set for life with a solid, middle-class lifestyle,” Jason Gordon, a local alderman, told me at the time. “That doesn’t exist here anymore, and I don’t think it exists anywhere anymore.”

Scott County ended up voting for Clinton, but barely — she won by less than 2 percentage points. Obama won it by nearly 14 points four years earlier.

None of this is to say that economic issues are the only, or even the primary, explanation for Trump’s success. A recent paper from researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found that racism and sexism predicted support for Trump better than economic dissatisfaction. But even that paper found that economic dissatisfaction was an important factor. In other words, the “economics or culture” argument is a false dichotomy. There’s no reason that both forces couldn’t matter; in fact, both did.

This debate isn’t merely an academic curiosity. The role of economics in the election matters politically: for Trump, because voters may turn on him if he doesn’t deliver on his economic promises, and for Democrats, because they will struggle to win back the White House if they don’t find ways to speak convincingly on these issues. And it matters in terms of policy: Trump’s economic plans may not make much sense, but the problems identified by his supporters are real. Manufacturing jobs really have disappeared, and we haven’t yet found a source of similarly stable, well-paying jobs to take their place. Wages really have stagnated for much of the past 15 years, and economic mobility, at least by some definitions, really has fallen. College costs really have risen, and our retirement system really is broken. Until politicians and policymakers find ways to address those issues, economic anxiety — and its political consequences — isn’t likely to go away.

Still waiting for a CEA chair

Trump has announced nominations for nearly all the top posts in his administration. One of the last vacancies: chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, traditionally (though not always) one of the president’s most influential consultants on economic issues.

A few weeks back, it looked like Trump was poised to name CNBC talking-head Larry Kudlow to the post. The rumor drew lots of attention because of Kudlow’s unusual background for the position (he doesn’t have a degree in economics, for one). But Kudlow would also have been notable because of his strong advocacy for “supply-side economics,” which argues that lower taxes and reduced regulation are the best ways to promote economic growth. That’s hardly unusual for a Republican; supply-side theory, in one form or another, has dominated conservative economic policy since the Reagan administration. But Trump’s campaign featured an unusual (some might say awkward) blend of supply-side economics and populism — Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric is a distinct departure from supply-side orthodoxy. Observers have been watching Trump’s Cabinet picks closely to see which set of policies would have the upper hand in his administration.

With less than two weeks to go before he is sworn in, Trump has yet to name a clear supply-sider to a senior economic policy position in his administration. Wilbur Ross Jr., his pick for Commerce secretary, and Peter Navarro, who Trump has named to a newly created post overseeing trade policy, are both avowed skeptics of free trade, at least as it has been practiced in recent decades. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has said little about his views on economic policy.

Kudlow would represent by far the administration’s strongest advocate for supply-side policies. But the delay in filling the CEA role suggests that Kudlow doesn’t yet have the job sewn up. What Trump ultimately decides could be a key hint of where the balance of power will lie in his administration.

The week ahead

Speaking of Trump’s administration, this week brings the first wave of confirmation hearings for Cabinet nominees. Of particular note will be Thursday’s hearing for Ross, who is widely believed to be one of Trump’s closest advisers on the economy. Ross, a billionaire investor, will probably face some tough questions about potential conflicts of interest, and Democrats are sure to press him on some of his past business dealings. But so far, there is little sign of organized opposition to Ross’s nomination. Those looking for drama might have to wait until next week, when Andy Puzder, Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary, faces senators. Puzder, an outspoken critic of recent minimum wage-increases, is drawing protests from labor groups. That isn’t likely to stop his confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate, but it could lead to some heated moments in the hearing room.

Last week at FiveThirtyEight

The new year brought pay raises to millions of low-wage workers. It also begins a large-scale experiment on the impact of minimum wages above $10 an hour.

The final jobs report of Obama’s presidency showed the U.S. adding 156,000 jobs in December. That’s a stark difference from Obama’s first jobs report, which showed the loss of nearly 600,000 jobs.

As Obamacare faces possible repeal, Anna Maria Barry-Jester looked at the law’s legacy and found that its degree of success depends heavily on which metric you choose to evaluate it.

What will a Trump presidency mean for economic data and other government statistics? We discussed the issue on FiveThirtyEight’s politics podcast.

Trump. Nevertheless, I'm going to stick my neck out: Within four years, President Trump will tank the economy.

First off, a few things that I don't think will matter, since a lot of other commentators obsess over them: Trump's erratic behavior isn't going to panic the stock market, and his changes to global trade arrangements will be modest, perhaps even positive.

Worries to the contrary all make a similar mistake: They assume the wealthy and their willingness to invest is the central driver of economic action. Instead what matters is the activity of ordinary people: their trades, their purchases, their daily work, their small risks, their ongoing efforts to make life for their families a bit better. Without all that, there are no financial assets for investors to park their money in.

This brings us to Trump and the Congressional GOP.

It's unlikely their policies will create a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. They could if they dismantled Dodd-Frank's financial regulations, but the Republicans' majority in the Senate isn't anywhere near big enough to break a filibuster. To paraphrase Tolstoy, all happy economies are the same; all unhappy ones are unhappy in their own way.

Instead, Trump and the Republicans will gut the U.S. budget, and thus the economy, via reconciliation, a Senate procedural move that allows lawmakers to pass bills with simple majorities if they're solely concerned with budgetary questions. They'll use this tool to suck hundreds of billions of dollars out of ordinary economic activity every year, depriving Americans of spending money, shrinking business revenue, lowering investment, and cutting tens of thousands of government jobs. This will lead to even less macro-economic spending, thus sending the economy into a tailspin.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has his budget ready to go, which would take an axe to Medicaid, food stamps, housing assistance, and the rest of the safety net. Then there's another budget-slashing proposal from the arch-conservative Heritage Foundation, which is apparently serving as a basis for Trump's plans as well. As The Hill just reported, these cuts would extend far beyond the safety net, and decimate most of the government's investments in civil society.

A quick sampling: Programs at the Department of Justice that deal with civil rights and violence against women will be reduced or eliminated; energy programs to promote nuclear physics, green energy, efficiency, and more will be cut; the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be privatized; the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities would be wiped out entirely. Tens of billions will be cut from energy subsidies, transit, water conservation, and more.

Every safety net program is extra money in people's pockets to spend in their communities, sustaining business and the jobs they create. Every government project invested in, every staff position created, is one more person with a paycheck, who can then go out and spend, producing ripples through the private sector, and leading to more investment and more hiring. Trumps' cuts will bleed hundreds of billions of dollars out of those virtuous cycles every year.

To get a sense of the sheer scale of the change, the total reductions in the Heritage blueprint come to $10.5 trillion over the next decade. That's roughly one quarter of all federal spending. That's truly gargantuan.

Now, some of the cuts in Heritage's budget are to Medicare and Social Security, which Trump is staying away from so far. Ultimately, the GOP may even balk at repealing ObamaCare's subsidies. All of which would bring that $10.5 trillion down to $7.5 trillion or $6.5 trillion. Which is still a gargantuan sum.

On top of that, Trump's appointments to the Federal Reserve will probably slow the economy further. During his campaign, the president was all over the place on monetary policy. But he eventually settled on the standard GOP line: Tight money and higher interest rates. This would be like tying weights to the economy's back after Trump's budgets have already bled it by a thousand cuts.

One could argue that Trump's tax cuts will offset all this. They could add up to $6 trillion themselves to the debt over 10 years, though right now no one really knows what Trump is planning. But the vast bulk of those cuts would not put money back in the pockets of ordinary workers and consumers. They would put money back in the pockets of wealthy investors. Even Trump's much-ballyhooed infrastructure plan is reportedly going to be graft for big business via corporate tax cuts. All in all, spending reductions will probably far outweigh tax cuts, at least in terms of the economic activity that drives most economic growth.

It's possible this outlook is too bleak. Trump could defy his party and resist more than just the cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Or he could switch back to his old love for low interest rates. Or the Republicans themselves could just wimp out in the face of popular backlash. All of that seems unlikely, though.

My analysis might even be too optimistic. Trump is a consummate salesman but an empty vessel when it comes to policy. So he could just wind up caving to the congressional GOP's demands, and give the country the ""full Heritage.""

So, best-case scenario: The already-lackluster economic recovery slows even further to a bare crawl. Worst-case scenario: The policies of President Trump and the Republicans pitch us into recession sometime in the next four years.

You heard it here first."

Withdrawing from the Paris agreement will be damaging both to the United States and the world. Sadly, Trump’s withdrawal announcement makes clear that the president has little understanding of the nature of the agreement, the process for withdrawal, or the implications of withdrawal for the United States, let alone for the world.

What Does President Trump’s announcement actually mean?

The president’s comments were confused and confusing. He said that the country “will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States. We are getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great.”

The notion of renegotiating the Paris agreement is a nonstarter. Within hours of the president’s announcement, the idea of renegotiation was rebuked by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, among many other world leaders.

But what could Trump even mean by his assertions of the deal’s “unfairness” to the United States, and what should we make of his statement that such unfairness could be addressed through renegotiation?

But what could Trump even mean by his assertions of the deal’s “unfairness” to the United States, and what should we make of his statement that such unfairness could be addressed through renegotiation? According the Paris agreement’s own provisions, there is a required three-year delay from November 2016 (when the agreement came into force) before any party (country) can even begin the process of withdrawing, and then there is another year of delay before that process is completed. So what the president actually announced — in effect — was the U.S. government’s intention to begin the process of withdrawing some two and a half years from now.

Thus, the announcement was equivalent to stating that the U.S. will remain a party to the agreement for the time being (which it will). The administration could — in theory — submit a revised nationally determined contribution that is consistent with what the country can accomplish in emissions reductions (possibly a 15 to 19 percent reduction by 2025 compared with 2005, according to a recent Rhodium Group analysis, instead of the Obama nationally determined contribution of a 26 to 28 percent decline), due to the broad rollback of Obama-era climate regulations that Trump has initiated. The country-specific, nationally determined contribution is the key element that can be thought of as affecting “fairness” of the U.S. role under the Paris agreement, because it is only through the self-determined, voluntary, country-specific contributions that any national targets or actions are specified.

READ MORE: What will the world look like if the U.S. bails on the Paris climate deal?

Given that the administration had already begun the process of unraveling Obama-era climate regulations (that were to be used achieve the Obama nationally determined contribution), the announced withdrawal from the Paris agreement has no additional effects on U.S. emissions mitigation actions. Hence, it is fundamentally dishonest to claim as a justification for the withdrawal that this will reduce costs for the U.S. and save jobs.

Beyond the national targets and actions specified by the U.S. nationally determined contribution, there is one other aspect of pledged action under the Paris agreement that could be considered to affect fairness, and that is the set of pledges of financial contributions to the Green Climate Fund, to which industrialized countries have voluntarily pledged $10 billion since 2013 to help low-income countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. If the U.S. were to fulfill its original $3 billion commitment to the fund, this would amount to $9.41 per capita, ranking 11th among country pledges, starting with Sweden’s at $59.31 per person. However, the president had previously announced that no funds will be going to the Green Climate Fund (beyond the $1 billion already delivered during the Obama administration). That makes the per capita U.S. contribution a bit more than $3, ranking close to the bottom of the list, only above South Korea’s pledge of about $2 per capita. So with this financial element, as well as with regard to domestic emissions mitigation actions, withdrawal from the Paris agreement can have no real effects on the “fairness” of the U.S. role.

The Paris agreement was the answer to U.S. prayers

The very structure of the Paris agreement itself was and is the answer to U.S. prayers, going back to the Byrd-Hagel Resolution of 1997, in which the U.S. Senate – in a 95-0 vote – said that it would not ratify an international climate agreement that did not include the large emerging economies (China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico and Korea). After more than 20 years of negotiations, an important breakthrough came with the signing of the Paris agreement, which increased the scope of participation from countries accounting for just 14 percent of global emissions (under the current, second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol) to countries accounting for 97 percent under the Paris agreement.

Furthermore, in addition to including almost all countries, the Paris agreement answered another U.S. demand by granting countries the right to determine their own targets and their own paths of action (through their respective nationally determined contributions).

READ MORE: What leaving the Paris accord could mean for U.S. and the world

And the third of three U.S. wishes was also granted by the Paris agreement, by providing for transparency around how countries report their emissions and demonstrate progress toward their respective targets.

Thus, the Paris agreement was truly the answer to bipartisan U.S. prayers going back at least 20 years and was eminently “fair” to the United States. What, then, can renegotiation possibly accomplish that would make this president happy? Perhaps one option would be to simply rename precisely the same agreement the “Mar-a-Lago Accord” (or simply the “Trump Agreement”)! That might change this president’s mind.

A rebuke to countries around the world… and to U.S. businesses

Mr. Trump’s decision is a remarkable rebuke to countries and heads-of-state around the world, as well as corporate leaders in the United States, and some key senior officials of the administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. However, the announcement does attempt to fulfill the president’s campaign pledge to “cancel” the agreement that he claimed would “destroy American jobs.”

This broad support [for the Paris agreement] was due to a simple reality – leaders of successful businesses make decisions not on the basis of ideology, but based on available evidence.

But dropping out of Paris will have no meaningful employment impacts. Again, Trump had already begun the process of undoing domestic climate regulations from the Obama administration. More to the point, the much-talked-about coal jobs are not coming back. The losses that have taken place over decades are due to increased productivity (technological change) in the coal sector and, more recently, market competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation.

Support for Trump to keep the United States in the Paris agreement was broad-based within U.S. private industry — from electricity generators, such as PG&E and National Grid, to oil companies, such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon-Mobil, BP and Shell (the last two having large operations within the U.S.), and a very long list of manufacturers, including giant firms such as General Motors and General Electric. Even some of the largest coal producers, such as Arch Coal, Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy, told the president about their support for the U.S. remaining in the agreement. This broad support was due to a simple reality – leaders of successful businesses make decisions not on the basis of ideology, but based on available evidence.

Damages to U.S. international relations

The potential damages to U.S. international relations are immense, but should we be surprised? After all, this is the same president who withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership days after inauguration, thereby handing over economic leadership in Asia to China; and the same president who just last month dismissed and diminished NATO and insulted our key European allies, thereby granting Russian President Vladimir Putin one of his greatest wishes. Former Mexican President Vincente Fox may have summed it up best with the shocking yet realistic assessment that “the United States has stopped being the leader of the free world.”

At a time when the U.S. wants and needs cooperation from a large and diverse set of countries around the world on matters of national security, trade and a host of other issues, it is counter-productive in the extreme to willingly become an international pariah on global climate change, but that is what Trump has accomplished.

Defining U.S. climate policy geographically, rather than by federal government action

Of course, this is not the end of all climate change policy action in the United States. Climate policies in California, Oregon, Washington and the Northeast will remain in place and quite possibly be strengthened. And more than half of all states have renewable energy policies; just since Election Day, the Republican governors of Illinois and Michigan have signed legislation aimed at increasing solar and wind generation. At the federal level, important tax credits for wind and solar power continue to receive bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress. But it is highly unlikely – in the absence of a significant economic recession — that those policies (plus others from cities across the country) will be sufficient to achieve the climate targets that made up the Obama administration’s anticipated contribution under the Paris agreement.

Trump’s core and a sad bottom line

For Trump’s core supporters, the move was probably perceived in very positive terms. As Cary Coglianese, a professor of law and political science at the University of Pennsylvania, has said, “For Trump supporters it looks like he’s delivering on a campaign promise — it looks like he’s standing up for Americans against the rest of the world.” The opposition to Paris among Trump’s electoral core (and a considerable share of congressional Republicans) is linked with their admiration for his “America First” battle cry, which seems to build on nostalgia for an earlier (and whiter) America with its long-gone manufacturing-based economy, plus doses of xenophobia, hostility to immigration, fear of globalism and opposition to multilateral agreements of any kind.

The announcement by President Trump that he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement was based neither on real science nor sound economics.

The president’s announcement of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement will indeed appeal to his core constituency, and thereby may help galvanize his base, and that may be the central White House objective at this time when the administration is facing grave questions and challenges from congressional hearings and Justice Department investigations. As Ban Ki-moon, former secretary-general of the United Nations, and I wrote in April in The Boston Globe, “reducing emissions will not be cheap or easy, but the greatest obstacles are political.”

The announcement by President Trump that he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement was based neither on real science nor sound economics. Rather, it was confused, misguided, and — in some ways — dishonest. Sadly, that makes it consistent with much of this president’s behavior — in a variety of policy realms — during the campaign and since he assumed office."

Story Highlights 51% approve of Trump's handling of the economy, up from 45% in June

Trump's economy rating higher than most recent presidents' at eight-month mark

Public divided on Trump's handling of the North Korea situation

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A slim majority of Americans, 51%, now say they approve of the way Donald Trump is handling the economy. That is up from 45% in June and is his best rating among four issues tested in the latest Gallup poll.

President Donald Trump's Job Approval Rating on Economy Highest of Four Issues Tested Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling -- [ITEMS READ IN RANDOM ORDER]? Feb 2017 Jun 2017 Sep 2017 % % % The economy 48 45 51 The situation with North Korea n/a n/a 45 Foreign affairs 38 35 41 Immigration 42 40 39 Gallup

Trump's economic approval rating in the Sept. 6-10 survey marks the first time he has earned majority approval on any issue Gallup has asked about, including four issues measured in February and 10 in June.

The September poll also finds that 45% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of North Korea, 41% rate his handling of foreign affairs positively and 39% give him favorable reviews on immigration. His rating on immigration has changed little in recent months, while his foreign affairs rating is up slightly.

Trump's overall job approval rating has yet to hit the majority approval level, topping out at 46% just after he took office in January. In Gallup Daily tracking, his job approval rating has been below 40% since early July. It has improved slightly over the past two weeks after falling to personal lows the last full week of August. His most recent weekly average approval rating is 37%, based on Sept. 4-11 Gallup tracking.

Since Gallup last asked about Trump's handling of issues in June, the stock market has reached new record highs and economic growth has picked up, while unemployment remains low. Trump appears to be receiving credit for these positive economic developments, evidenced by his 91% approval rating on the economy among Republicans, 48% among independents and 15% among Democrats. Each of those partisan approval ratings for his economic performance is significantly higher than his overall job approval rating among the same groups.

Trump's Economic Approval Better Than Most Recent Presidents'

Trump's economic approval rating eight months into office compares favorably with those of other recent presidents. It is better than the ratings Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had at similar points in their presidencies, but lower than George W. Bush's. (Gallup did not measure George H.W. Bush's handling of the economy in the late summer or early fall of 1989.)

The younger Bush's high economic rating largely reflects the post-9/11 rally in support for him. Gallup's last rating of Bush's handling of the economy before 9/11-- in July 2001 -- was 54%.

Unlike Trump and the younger Bush, Reagan, Clinton and Obama came into office during challenging economic times. Nevertheless, each enjoyed relatively high economic approval ratings prior to the eight-month mark, during the honeymoon phases of their presidencies. This included 60% approval for Reagan's handling of the economy in April 1981, 49% for Clinton in March 1993 and 59% for Obama in February 2009. However, these approval ratings quickly waned, falling 10 or more percentage points by the late summer or early fall of their first year in office.

Gallup has asked Americans to assess presidents' handling of the economy periodically since 1971, including more frequent updates beginning with Reagan's presidency. Clinton has the record-high economic approval rating of 81% in 1999. The elder Bush has the record low of 17% in 1992. The average rating is 43%.

Trump's Foreign Affairs Rating Worse Than Other Presidents'

While Trump's rating for his handling of the economy compares favorably with those of other recent presidents, his 41% approval rating for handling foreign affairs is the lowest among this group. George W. Bush's 81% rating for handling foreign affairs shortly after 9/11 is the best for any recent president roughly eight months into his presidency. Reagan and Obama had approval ratings above the majority level, while Clinton's was slightly below it.

In contrast to the current situation for Trump, presidents generally tend to receive higher ratings for handling foreign affairs than for handling the economy. The average foreign affairs approval rating for presidents since 1974 is 50%, including a high of 84% for the elder Bush in 1991 after the U.S. won the Persian Gulf War. The record-low rating of 29%, held by the younger Bush, was recorded in August 2007 -- four years into the Iraq War and before Americans saw the ""surge"" in the number of U.S. troops in Iraq as working.

Implications

Trump's job approval ratings generally have been poor, but evaluations of his handling of the economy are a relative bright spot for him. Buoyed by many positive economic reports, and perhaps Americans' belief that the former businessman would handle the economy well as president, a majority of U.S. adults now approve of Trump's economic stewardship. Trump's overall ratings, then, may be held down by his lower ratings on other issues, including foreign affairs and immigration, as well as fundamental concerns about his character. Indeed, perceptions of Trump's character have gotten worse since he took office.

Thus, as Trump serves out the remainder of his first term, his ability to win re-election may depend most on Americans being willing to overlook their continued concerns about his personal qualities. Doing so may be easier if in 2020 Americans regard the state of the economy, and the nation more generally, as very strong.

Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s nominee for treasury secretary, has said that the administration’s objective is to raise the rate of GDP growth to three to four percent, doubling the rate achieved over the last decade. This will be accomplished by establishing a globally competitive corporate tax rate, adopting a territorial corporate tax system, reducing excessive regulation, boosting domestic energy production, and introducing better trade policies.

The United States has the highest corporate tax rate of any country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At 35 percent, the U.S. rate far exceeds the rates of the United Kingdom (20 percent), Germany (16 percent), Canada (15 percent), Ireland (13 percent), and many other countries. This high rate discourages investment, and reducing it will encourage it. The Trump administration plans to lower the corporate rate to 15 percent, eliminating the disadvantage for U.S. companies, making the United States a more attractive destination for investment, and creating jobs for American workers.

In addition to a high domestic corporate tax rate, the United States also imposes a 35 percent tax on repatriated foreign earnings (with a credit for any foreign taxes paid). This has led U.S. companies to locate their manufacturing operations abroad and to keep their foreign earnings abroad, as well, rather than bring them back to the United States. Few other countries have such a policy, and it is one reason why U.S. companies have parked an estimated $2.5 trillion overseas.

This unfavorable tax structure, moreover, has caused many U.S. companies to behave oddly. Apple, for instance, borrows money in the United States, even though it has over $200 billion in cash reserves abroad (kept there in order to avoid paying the taxes that repatriation would generate). The chip maker Qualcomm recently announced a $39 billion acquisition of the Dutch company NXP Semiconductors—a move that will help it avoid paying billions in U.S. taxes, according to Americans for Tax Fairness. And scores of U.S. companies have actually “inverted,” turning themselves into nominally foreign companies so as to take advantage of such firms’ ability to bring cash earned abroad into the United States tax free.

To reverse this trend and encourage U.S. companies to bring their foreign cash home for investment, Trump has proposed reducing the tax on repatriated earnings from 35 percent to ten percent. The move has broad support among Republicans in Congress, and some combination of a lower corporate tax rate and a lower tax on repatriated funds will likely be passed into law.

Another factor holding the U.S. economy back has been excessive regulation. Unnecessary regulation makes it harder for companies to succeed and results in increased costs, lower investment, and restricted growth. This has been especially true of the financial sector in recent years, as reactions to the financial crisis overshot the mark. Not all regulation is pernicious, of course. Higher capital requirements and the elimination of off-balance-sheet financing, for example, have helped strengthen the domestic and global financial systems. But many of the financial regulations in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act have placed heavy burdens of compliance on companies and impeded lending.

The cost of complying with cumbersome new regulations has been staggering. For example, from 2011 to 2015 alone, the ten largest U.S. banks collectively paid $52.5 billion in consulting and advisory fees on compliance-related issues. In 2014, Citibank had 30,000 employees working on compliance and regulatory issues, up by 33 percent from three years earlier. In the same year, J.P. Morgan increased its risk-control staff by 33 percent, in addition to using thousands of outside consultants.

The cost of complying with cumbersome new regulations has been staggering.

The obstacles to growth caused by excessive and poorly conceived regulation are part of the reason the current economic recovery has been so slow compared with its predecessors. Limitations on credit have put a damper on new home construction, consumer spending, and business investment.

The mortgage sector offers an example of the complexity, redundancies, and wastefulness of ill-considered government intervention. Regulators have been fighting one another about who has authority over the area, with each regulator imposing its own layer of often conflicting regulations. The result has been an almost total halt in private mortgage securitizations, which have fallen by 99 percent from their 2005 peak of over $1 trillion in annual issuance. This near freeze has deprived a huge segment of Americans of mortgage financing. Overregulation and the collapse of the private mortgage securitization market have restrained the recovery in new home construction—which helps explain why, although new home construction has risen from its recent lows, it is still far below its previous peak and below the average level of housing required.

To lead the effort to break up the regulatory clog, Trump has appointed two highly capable executives. Mnuchin is the former CEO of OneWest Bank, and Gary Cohn, Trump’s choice to head the National Economic Council, is the former president of Goldman Sachs. Both have extensive knowledge of the negative effects that excessive regulation has on the availability of credit and on growth. And beyond finance, other sectors ripe for regulatory reform include health care, labor, and energy.

A competitive corporate tax structure and reduced regulation will lead to higher economic growth. There are scores of real-life examples that show the impact of tax and regulatory policies on growth, and some patterns are clear. Generally, countries with high tax rates and high regulation (such as France and Italy) achieve lower growth, while those with low tax rates and low regulation (such as Ireland) achieve higher growth.

A competitive corporate tax structure and reduced regulation will lead to higher economic growth.

With the second-lowest corporate tax rate in Europe and light regulation, Ireland has the highest growth rate in the region and offers a model to follow. When asked why businesses invest there, executives point to the business-friendly environment. And even my own firm, after reviewing many other locations in Europe, chose to locate its offshore services operations in Dublin for the same reason.

BEYOND TAXES AND REGULATION

The United States has abundant energy resources and the technology to exploit them in previously unimaginable ways. A barrage of regulations, however, have made it difficult to reap the full benefits of this situation. The Trump administration plans to lift restrictions and streamline the permitting process in order to facilitate growth in energy production and infrastructure.

A good example of such barriers to growth can be found in the slow rate of approval for export terminals for liquefied natural gas. American firms have developed technology that allows them to extract gas from previously unattainable sources at extremely low prices. Unless the gas is liquefied, however, it cannot be exported and remains trapped in the United States. The construction of liquefied natural gas export terminals would allow it to be sold abroad. This would encourage still more development at home, creating more jobs, reducing the trade deficit, and spurring growth. Unfortunately, such construction has been delayed and restricted because of the vast number of approvals required from agencies that include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, and many others.

A final component of the Trump administration’s economic plan will be the renegotiation of trade deals so as to protect and expand U.S. exports. Trump has said that he is not opposed to trade in general—in fact, he strongly favors it—but he does oppose unfair trade. And dealings with China are a good example of where improvements can be made.

The United States has abundant energy resources and the technology to exploit them in previously unimaginable ways.

In 2015, the United States imported $482 billion worth of goods from China while exporting only $116 billion, leading to a trade deficit of $366 billion. Chinese firms have almost unrestricted access to U.S. markets, yet U.S. firms face severe restrictions and roadblocks when trying to do business in China. Putting the commercial relationship on more equal terms, as well as tightening up the enforcement of intellectual property laws, would help raise U.S. exports and significantly reduce the bilateral trade deficit.

Making the United States an attractive place for investment, supporting export industries, and improving terms of trade with foreign counterparts will go a long way toward improving the U.S. trade balance, boosting U.S. growth in the process.

Disregarding the media’s gloom and doom, U.S. investors and businesses have responded more favorably to the incoming administration’s economic plans than most expected, with the S&P 500 rising by more than seven percent between the election and the end of the year and financial services rallying 19 percent. In December, Ray Dalio, chair of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said that Trump’s pro-business outlook could help boost growth. And in January, Mark Fields, the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, announced that Ford would cancel a $1.6 billion project in Mexico and instead expand its operations in Michigan, citing “the more positive U.S. business environment” that he expected under Trump.

Competitive corporate taxes, easier repatriation of foreign earnings, a less burdensome regulatory environment, expanded domestic energy production, and trade deals that give U.S. companies a fair chance to compete—together these will create jobs, accelerate growth, and lead to a new era of American prosperity."

What is the researchers’ general opinion on open access to data?

Despite the fact that open access to research data is widely considered a way of fostering scientific progress and although it is promoted by science policy makers, few researchers make their data publicly available. To see how researchers view open access to data, one question battery targeted the researchers’ general opinion. Table 2 summarizes the results to this set of questions.

Table 2 General perception towards open access to data Full size table

The results show a general consensus in the research community that open access to data benefits academic research and that researchers should make their data publicly available. Eighty-three per cent of the respondents agree that openly available research data is a major contribution to scientific progress. Seventy-six per cent of the respondents say that other researchers should make their data publicly available. The majority of the researchers in our survey sees no disadvantage in making data publicly available. Seventy-four per cent disagree that they are deterred from publishing articles if a journal requires the publication of data. Seventeen per cent of the researchers agree with the statement that sharing data brings more disadvantages than advantages. While the results may be influenced by social desirability, the clarity of the responses shows that open access to research data is considered beneficial for research in general and is not considered detrimental to the individual researcher who shares data.

How and with whom have reseaerchers shared data in the past?

Open access to research data can be understood as one form of data sharing. Therefore, this research question explores with whom researchers share their data, and hence, which particular forms of data sharing are common in small science. For this purpose, we asked the researchers if they themselves have already shared data with others and if so, with whom. Table 3 summarizes the responses to that question.

Table 3 “Have you ever shared your research data with others?” Full size table

The results show that most researchers have shared data in the past, although most have done so selectively. Across disciplines, 13% of all respondents stated that they have shared research data publicly at least once in the past. In contrast, 16% of our respondents stated that they have never shared data with other researchers. This result is surprising, since previous research reported numbers below 10% for never having shared research data(Campbell et al., 2002; Tenopir et al., 2011). The numbers regarding the scope of sharing vary considerably. For example, 58% of the respondents state that they have shared data with colleagues whom they know personally, but only 6% of all respondents stated that they have shared data with commercial researchers. Data sharing is already common practice among researchers. However, it mainly occurs among colleagues that know each other, for example, in joint research projects. In contrast, open access to data is a practice that is far less common.

There are also interesting results regarding the discipline and gender. For example: 28% of the social scientists and economists say that they have never shared data, whereas only 9% of natural scientists never shared data. 25% of the female researchers have never shared data, compared with 13% of the male researchers (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.1).

What factors influence open access to research data?

This question explores whether there are any parameters that have an influence on the researchers’ behaviour in regards to open access to data. Out of an exploratory interest, we tested factors that influence the sharing behaviour of a researcher. The sharing behaviour is defined here as the willingness to make data publicly available and the actual experience of making data publicly available.

The results of the regression analysis show that there is no significant influence of a researchers age on his/hers willingness to make data publicly available and on whether the respondent has done so in the past. The same holds true for the status a researcher has reached and his/her experience in academic research. This result is surprising, since previous research suggested that senior researchers are more willing to share data than their younger colleagues (Tenopir et al., 2011).

Knowledge regarding data management has a positive effect on the data sharing behaviour. Researchers who know how to make data publicly available are significantly more willing to do so (P<0.008) and they are more likely to have done so in the past (P<0.001). Researchers who have used secondary data before are significantly more willing to make it available publicly (P<0.052). The results show that knowledge on data management and previous experience are good indicators for data sharing.

Publishing preferences have an effect on the data sharing behaviour. Researchers that value open access highly are significantly more likely to make their data publicly available (P<0.001; see Supplementary Appendix Table A.2). The fact that a journal has a high reputation and a fast publishing process have no significant influence (P=0.627, respectively, P=0.110).

There are also interesting descriptive results. Overall “only” 56% of the respondents say that they know where to find secondary data and 50% know where and how to publish research data. Natural scientists know more about where and how they can publish data than respondents from other disciplines. Researchers from engineering and agriculture know far less about where they can find secondary data for their research than respondents from other disciplines (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.3). Seventy-nine per cent of the respondents in our survey agree that reputation/impact is important when publishing research results. It is by far the most important criteria when publishing, followed by a fast publishing process with 52% agreement, and lastly open access, with an agreement level of 39% (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.4).

What are barriers and enablers for open access to data?

With this question we want to unravel the specific aspects that either stop researchers from providing open access to their data or that promote this form of data sharing.

By a wide margin, the most prominent concern researchers have is that “other researchers could publish before me” (80%; see Table 4); the test variable “to publish before sharing” (85%) is the second most important enabler for making data publicly available (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.5). Hence, most researchers would keep a dataset to themselves until they are sure they have published every aspect of it. Furthermore, 46% say the concern that their data could be misinterpreted prevents them from making it publicly available. Only a few researchers (12%) are concerned about being “criticized or falsified.” The latter is interesting since potential falsifications have been widely hypothesized as a reason not to make make data available (Longo and Drazen, 2016a).

Table 4 Barriers: “I would not share my data …” Full size table

The majority of the respondents (73%) disagree that criticism or falsification would prevent them from making data publicly available (Table 4). The effort that went into the data collection is considered a barrier to making data available for 59% of the researchers. They agreed with the statement “I would not share my data if the data collection required considerable effort.” However, researchers are more likely to withhold their data if the sharing itself is a major effort (Table 4). Overall the effort to make data available is the second biggest impediment we could find (only behind “other researchers could publish before me”).

Interestingly, despite the demand for more formal recognition, only a minority regards “Co- authorship” as a motivator. Across disciplines, 79% of the respondents say that data citation would motivate them to make data available to others; only 10% say it would not. Financial support for sharing data is considered a motivator by only 17% of the respondents and rejected by 65% of the researchers (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.5). The results indicate that researchers seek more formal recognition.

Despite the fact that the overall pattern in how the respondents evaluate statements are similar in all disciplines, there are some interesting differences. For example: 58% of the medical researchers see a co-authorship as an enabler for sharing but only 23% of the social scientists and economists and 21% of the humanities scholars. This result indicates that co-authorship for sharing data is accepted among medical researchers in contrast to all other disciplines (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.6).

For what purpose do researchers use secondary data?

Our last question explores use cases for secondary data. Here, we want to understand what researchers would use openly available data for. If there was no demand for secondary data, the argument for open research data in small science would be invalid. We, therefore, asked researchers if they have used secondary data before and for which purpose they used it. Across all disciplines, 69% of researchers have worked with secondary data before.

Social science has the highest rate of secondary data users, with 78% of social scientists using this kind of data followed by natural science at 69%. The lowest rate of secondary data users can be found in agricultural science with 58% (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.7). The majority of the researchers across disciplines prefer to use secondary data to address novel research questions than to verify results. This assessment is especially true for the social sciences, where 69% of the respondents would use secondary data for novel research questions and only 17% to replicate results. In comparison, in medicine, 48% of the respondents would use secondary data for novel research questions and 38% for replicating results (see Supplementary Appendix Table A.8)."

Trump tweeted: “Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!”, encouraging the world to put aside the unfolding Russia scandal, impotence over North Korean missile launches and the sacking of newly arrived press secretary Anthony “the Mooch” Scaramucci, and look instead at the economic boom apparently unfolding under the president’s administration.

Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2017

A little while later he followed up his summary of economic news by tweeting a quote from Fox News morning anchor Stuart Varney that said: “Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now”.

""Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now."" Thank you Stuart Varney @foxandfriends Jobs are starting to roar,watch! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2017

As a final riposte to critics, he added: “Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!”

Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2017

His message is clear. Whatever is going on in the White House, the folks on Main Street and Wall Street are back in business and making money, which raises the question: is the US economy really booming and how much credit can Trump take for it?

‘Highest stock market EVER…’

The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered through 22000 last week to hit another record high. The broader measure of US companies, the S&P 500, continued its ascent back to a high point established in June.

Wall Street analysts expect the US stock market, which has soared by more than a fifth since Trump took office, to maintain its supercharged rise for some time yet.

But not much of the boost can be credited to the president. There was an initial spike following his election as infrastructure companies boomed on hopes of big government spending contracts, and wealthy investors and corporations gambled that he would hand out eye-watering tax cuts.

But more important has been the action of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. This year, despite two small rate rises, the signs are that a return to anything like normal interest rates is a long way off. Falling inflation means that the pressure is off for the Fed to act and a slower pace of increases is now likely.

Stocks are not the only assets affected. Foreign exchange traders watch the same signals and since January have decided that rate rises, which act to suck foreign money into the US, are not going to happen. They sold the dollar, which has fallen by around 10% against a basket of currencies since January.

One major spin-off of that decline has been a boost to exports, especially to China, despite Trump’s anti-Beijing rhetoric. That’s good news for companies from Apple to General Electric.

Another trend is the spectacular revenues of most large companies. Firms have continued to spend their improving profit levels on share buybacks. This policy means companies spend their own cash to reduce the number of shares in circulation, pushing up their value on the stock market.

Verdict Yes, the stock market is up – but mostly in response to signals of a slower withdrawal of cheap credit by the Federal Reserve.

‘Best economic numbers…’

Trump is excited about the economy and his tweets are mostly in response to the improvement in GDP growth seen during the second quarter, to an annualised rate of 2.6%.

Surveys of the manufacturing and services sector for July and the latest monthly labour market data illustrate the buoyant state of the economy, with all three expanding.

But most indicators show consumer spending is losing its power and that eight years of vigorous expansion is drawing to its conclusion.

Figures from the Federal Housing Finance Agency show that annual house price rises have almost halved from 6% last year to 3.2% in the first half of 2017.

Retail sales have followed the same path. Strong growth in 2016 has petered out this year, with May and June recording significant declines amid falling demand for trucks, cars and discretionary items.

Robert J Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton, says: “This expansion is getting old. The growth rate is half what we saw in the 1990s and there are strong indications that the economy will weaken next year.”

Shapiro, who runs his own economic consultancy, Sonecon, in Washington, believes few people will permit Trump to take credit for the current benign economic situation – but will hold him responsible should it deteriorate by the midterm elections in November 2018.

“We always give credit for the economy in the first year to the previous president,” he says. “Trump hasn’t passed any significant legislation, and while he has put forward some de-regulation measures, they haven’t had any effect yet.”

Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, argues that his budget proposals for the autumn will extend the current run of strong growth and push it to beyond 3% year after year through to the middle of the next decade, at which point bumper tax receipts will bring the government spending deficit back into balance.

The budget is a mix of tax cuts for the richest and middle-income groups coupled with deep cuts in further education and welfare spending.

Albert Edwards, the famously gloomy global strategist at Société Générale, is convinced that the loose monetary policies preferred by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, and endorsed by Trump, are encouraging a debt bubble that will burst with similar consequences to the 2008 financial crash.

Edwards said in a recent note to investors: “I’m genuinely getting tired of bashing the major central banks, but every day more evidence mounts that almost exactly the same debt excesses that caused the global financial crisis in 2008 are present today.

“The Bank of England and Federal Reserve deserve particular vilification for failing to remove the monetary punchbowl quickly enough – just like the 2003-2007 period, allowing grotesque debt excesses to build.”

Mnuchin’s budget is expected to be watered down as it makes its way through Congress and emerge as not much more than a mild tax cut for the wealthy. That would leave the Fed unmoved and sticking to its course of only incremental interest rate rises over a period of years.

Verdict The best years of the current recovery are in the past, though unfunded tax cuts in the autumn could provide a sugar rush that pushes up growth and inflation next year.

‘Unemployment lowest…’

Economists have worried that the US economy is struggling to create significant employment despite Trump’s promise of “JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!”

July marked the 82nd consecutive month of jobs growth in the US, but, just as in the UK, the recovery from the depths of the 2008 recession has been marked by slow wage growth and a worryingly large number of people in part-time work. Huge numbers of women and older workers have quit the jobs market completely. America now has one of the lowest labour market participation rates in the developed world.

Jobs data has emphasised the trend, with the largest growth in low-paying service industry jobs, and not in the higher-paying traditional blue-collar industries Trump pledged to support.

Coal exports have boomed this year, but jobs in food services are growing at more than three times the rate of mining jobs, and manufacturing employment growth is static.

Shapiro says he advised Hillary Clinton before last November’s presidential election that she would need to put in place policies that raised the skill levels of blue-collar workers to prepare them for workplaces increasingly dominated by technology.

“You have already hit full employment so you can’t expect strong job expansion to support growth,” he says. “And without strong jobs growth you need to increase productivity, but that has been slow for three years and shows no sign of increasing.

“This is a White House that has largely been absorbed by the Russia scandal and the legal implications for senior members of the administration. It is not a White House with many eyes on the economy. For one thing there haven’t been any economists appointed yet. In the Treasury it’s just Secretary Mnuchin and that’s it.”

Verdict Well-paid blue-collar jobs remain hard to find, despite rising employment.

‘Wages rising…’

For much of the last decade, economists have expected a return to wage rises of 4% that dramatically lift consumer spending and feed into rising prices. It’s the trigger the Fed is looking for to raise interest rates more than the one percentage point it has managed in the last 20 months.

Wages once again grew only marginally in June, rising 2.5% from a year ago and little changed from prior months. Adjusted for inflation, “real” wage growth is close to 1%.

Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the labour market is looking mildly confusing at the moment after years of rising employment and low wages growth.

“The workforce is only growing at 0.5% and productivity’s at 1%. Even if productivity is raised to 1.5% you still don’t get near Mnuchin’s 3-4% wages growth targets,” says Posen, who has worked in central banks on both sides of the Atlantic – at the New York Fed and on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee.

He and Shapiro agree that there is little in Trump’s programme that will increase productivity.

Greg Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, says employers have coped with an ageing population by employing migrants, leaving much of Trump’s agenda as “anti-growth”.

He says: “The economy is doing OK, but not great. And the high hopes business had for Trump’s initiatives have turned negative because, if anything, the president’s time in office is characterised by protectionism, anti-immigration and lingering policy uncertainty.”

Daco has pencilled in growth averaging just 1.5% over the next 10 years.

Verdict Wage rises are showing no signs of picking up. The only silver lining is that paralysis on Capitol Hill will mean that inflation stays low and real wages stay positive.

‘NEVER made as much money…’

Kathleen Brooks, research director at spread-betting firm City Index, says that with 350 out of the 500 companies on the S&P 500 having reported earnings for the second quarter, it is clear that “virtually every sector exceeded expectations for earnings and sales”.

Domestic sales on average have remained solid as consumers shrug off the uncertainty created by legislative chaos in Washington.

The biggest boost has comes from exports, which rose modestly last month to $192bn – the highest since April 2015 – on rising shipments of cars and consumer goods, including mobile phones. Imports fell slightly.

Importantly, the deficit in the trade of goods with China fell by 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted $30.1bn.

Trump is credited with a boom in coal exports and a commitment from companies like Apple to bring back factories to the US when they invest in their next generation of phones. Apple’s profits, along with those of most tech firms, were among the highlights of the recent reporting season.

But the main reason for these numbers are improving global trade links, after a recovery from lows seen in 2015. While Trump may appear to be a huge political risk to smooth trade flows, the situation at the moment is calm and supporting improved global growth.

Trump could have his moment to boast as a result of his upcoming budget, which promises a huge cut in corporation tax from 35% – one of the highest headline rates in the G20. Scepticism that a cut can be agreed in Congress is rife, not least because Barack Obama was unable to push through similar reductions.

Nevertheless, just the prospect of budget handouts has lifted the spirits of average Americans. Unlike in the UK, where consumer confidence has fallen back to levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, Americans last week started feeling much more confident about the economy, pushing the Bloomberg consumer comfort index to a seven-week high.

The rising stock market, rather than anything Trump said or did, was credited with the confidence boost, especially among those earning more than $75,000.

Daco says he is concerned that after several years when consumers spent within their means, the income and spending trends started diverging last year. He blames a greater reliance on credit, especially to buy cars, and a “savings dip” that has seen consumers run down deposits to fund spending.

The latest data shows the personal savings rate at 3.8% – much lower than the pre-revision level of around 5% and down about 2 percentage points since the start of 2016.

Trump was having none of it on Friday, retweeting his fans. One said: “Republican Senators who are opposing the President, look at the great economic news: Americans Are Noticing!”

Verdict One of the few certainties is that corporations and wealthy company bosses will prosper under a Trump presidency."

“To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home, and abroad — a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places. Low pay and low wages.”

In describing the economy, context is important. And without taking anything away from the challenges Trump faces overseas, a few things should be noted in light of his comments:

The economy added 227,000 jobs last month, according to the first jobs report from the Trump administration, far surpassing the predicted 180,000 by economists. Manufacturing, which Trump often uses as a prime example of jobs leaving the country, actually experienced a slight uptick in numbers, along with service industries.

Employment rates are experiencing a pretty significant recovery. Around the new year, reports said that job growth is around 175,000 a month, and unemployment dropped down to 4.6 percent.

Wages are rising at their fastest pace in years. They’re up 2.9 percent from last year, adding about 75 cents to the average hourly pay. The increase has been especially salient in major cities.

Inflation is at a solid 2.5 percent.

Context matters."

Is it about economic angst among the white working class, or is it primarily a cultural backlash?

Writers like the Atlantic’s Michelle Cottle worried that “Trumpism has, in part, made the rest of the nation all the more eager to ignore the millions of white voters living on the edges of the economy.”

But as my Vox colleague Dylan Matthews noted, “there is absolutely no evidence that Trump’s supporters, either in the primary or the general election, are disproportionately poor or working class.” The median household income for Trump voters, as reported by FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver, was $72,000, roughly $10,000 higher than the median household income of non-Hispanic whites.

Pippa Norris is a comparative political scientist at Harvard University, and one of the leading authorities on populism. She’s also the co-author of a recent study on the rising support for populist parties in Western societies. Her paper examined the dueling theories about the causes of the populist surge and found that the cultural backlash explanation was the stronger of the two.

In this interview, I chat with Norris about her findings. Our conversation, edited for clarity and length, covers a lot of ground — from the distinctions between left and right-wing populism to the post-war cultural shifts that paved the way for populist candidates to the unique vulnerabilities of liberal democracies. We also discuss whether the cultural backlash in Europe and the United States represents a failure of multiculturalism as such.

Sean Illing

The term “populism” has become a vague catchall. What does it actually mean?

Pippa Norris

Populism for me has three dimensions. One of which is an appeal to popular sovereignty over and above liberal democracy. So the argument is that moral virtue and power should be with the ordinary people and not the elites.

The second dimension is anti-establishment, and this is opposed not just to political and economic elites but also to other perceived power-holders, like intellectuals or journalists or other groups at the top of society.

And then thirdly, even though it's about popular sovereignty in practice, there aren't that many mechanisms. Mechanisms like public opinion polls or other forms of democratic referendum are typically weak. So in practice, what happens is the power is seen to reside in the individual leader, the charismatic leader who represents the voice of the ordinary people.

So those three elements come together but they don't tell you a lot about what populists stand for. And here what you get is a variety of populists — from authoritarian populists to progressive populists, and they differ in their actual values.

So you can think of populism as a way to critique liberal democracy, which opens the door for a variety of leaders who have different ideologies, whether we're talking Hugo Chavez in Venezuela or Donald Trump in America.

Sean Illing

Does “authoritarian populism” and “progressive populism” mean right-wing populism and left-wing populism?

Pippa Norris

No, that’s not quite right. I use the terms left-wing and right-wing much more economically, and it has to do with where people are in state versus welfare, where people are in markets versus redistribution.

Authoritarianism is actually a different dimension. Authoritarian values are those which uphold belief in a strong leader, in a strong state, and in robust law and order. These are traditional values like the family, home, religion, and then a variety of other values like nativism, the importance of national unity, the national community versus outsiders, whether defined by nationality or ethnicity or race.

I think we tend to use the terms “left” and “right” in a sloppy fashion, because it's the familiar way that we classify parties in the post-war era in Europe where you see the difference, for example, between social democrats and communists versus conservatives and liberals.

What we've got now is a new cultural cleavage which overlays that, and populists therefore can be left-wing or right-wing or in the middle. Basically they're very vague on economics, but it's the cultural values which are the critical aspects which differ for them.

Sean Illing

How do you distinguish Donald Trump from Bernie Sanders, both of whom seem to fall under the populist umbrella?

Pippa Norris

Well, this is why we have varieties of populism. Populism authoritarians — like Trump — open the door because they reduce the checks and balances in liberal democracy, but then they try to push through a range of traditional authoritarian values. Populist progressives, like Sanders, employ similar rhetoric but they work out of a progressive agenda, not just in taxation like in Chavez in Venezuela, but also on other economic issues as well.

So you've got these basic cleavages, and you can classify European parties along the same line. In Spain, for example, you have Podemos, which is populist progressive. They're on the left in terms of economic issues. They're progressive in terms of social issues, but they want a critique of the establishment power and the elites.

Similarly, the Five Star Movement in Rome is definitely progressive although approaching more authoritarian. Then you have others in Greece, Finland, Sweden and elsewhere which also tilt authoritarian.

So populists have a particular approach to politics, but what they support depends on where they are on the cultural cleavage.

Sean Illing

This is part of the reason why it’s so difficult to talk about populism in an analytically precise way. It really transcends our traditional ideological categories.

Pippa Norris

It transcends the 1950s classification that we're so used to. The post-war era is one in which people are very much divided between those who believed in economic redistribution, a strong welfare state, and a role for Keynesian economic management versus those who believed in markets and hands off, low taxation and more classical liberalism in the economy.

This dimension has closed over the years. It's closed particularly in Europe, as many parties move toward the center, becoming catchall parties. What has emerged is a new dimension, and it started again in the ’60s and ’70s with the Green parties, which became more progressive and affirmed a different set of values toward cosmopolitanism and the environmentalism.

Then we saw, as a reaction against this new progressivism, the growth of those who believe in nationalism and authoritarianism. These parties, especially across Europe, have grown in strength in more recent periods even though in most countries they remain a minority.

Sean Illing

So, in many ways, we’ve got a new left and a new right struggling to absorb a different constellation of political values.

Pippa Norris

That’s right. The old distinctions don’t quite fit any longer. Conservatives have sought to adopt some of these new values, particularly the aggressive nationalism, but they pay a price for that. It’s very difficult for the old left to know how to adopt these values because they're on the progressive side and they don't know how to respond and hold on to their core beliefs about tolerance and cosmopolitanism.

Sean Illing

Populism isn’t tied to any particular ideological project, but do you consider a populist a demagogue by definition?

Pippa Norris

You can have authoritarian demagogues who aren’t populists and you can have populists who aren’t demagogues. But clearly it's often closely related. So some people argue that populism is a style and a language which appeals very much to ordinary people; it's short discourse and very straight language. It's often transgressive discourse, which uses language that is seen as unacceptable by traditional politicians, and that's an appeal again that the leader is part of the everyman.

Populists, and this is key, make a very deliberate effort to show that they’re of the common people. They’re not pointy-headed elites or cultural sophisticates. There are many demagogues who are populists and populists who are demagogues, but the two things are obviously separate. You can get demagogues who have other basic ways of expressing themselves.

Sean Illing

The transgressive part seems to me important. Populism, whatever else it is, is about disruption, about shattering the status quo.

Pippa Norris

That's right. In a liberal democracy, it's about shattering the established parties, the established cooperations and the established intellectual forms of power and hegemony. In some other countries, of course, you can see this is more democratic but it depends very much on the regime which is in power.

So if you think of revolutionary radical Muslims seeking to out some of the traditional leaders in authoritarian regimes, they're often populists but with a very different set of values behind them.

So populism is rather an empty shell when it comes to what its positives are, but it is always clear what it is against: established power.

Sean Illing

I want to return to what you said earlier about the cultural roots of modern populism. In one of your recent papers, you tell a familiar but troubling story: Since at least the 1970s, Western societies have emphasized what you call “post-materialist” and “self-expression” values among the young educated strata of society. This has produced movements toward greater gender and racial equality, equal rights for LGBTQ people, more acceptance of diverse lifestyles and cultures, etc. It’s also resulted in less focus on redistributionist economics.

You argue that we’ve reached something of a tipping point culturally as less educated and older citizens, particularly white men, are now increasingly resentful of a society that no longer privileges them or their values.

Pippa Norris

The idea that values are being changed has long roots going back to the 1970s, but it has new traction, if you like. The argument is that you adopt the values at the time that you grew up and it’s part of your societal conditioning. Look, for example, at the actual groups who were growing up in Europe when there was a welfare state from cradle to grave. The arguments were about meeting basic material needs — full employment, free education, free health care, etc.

In many of these countries, values changed from a focus on material needs — jobs, economic growth, and the things people who lived through the Great Recession and the period of war cared about — to a different set of values, which was environmental, gender equality, participation, democracy and a whole range of other post-material values. This is a long-term change which my co-author, Ron Inglehart, has predicted for many decades.

What we think happened is that there's been a tipping point in terms of where majority values have become the new minority. So it's really about population change more than anything else. If a generation grows up with certain values, those values gradually take over that culture. We can see the manifestation in many policies.

Think, for example, of gay marriage and the way in which marriage rights were something that was not even discussed 20 years ago or even 10 years ago. They weren't mainstream in the political agenda. And now many, many countries have equalized gay marriage, although affluent countries are still going through that process. Similarly, tolerance of homosexuality, ideas that women should have equal values, secular values as well, the idea that religion is no longer central to people's lives. So those are values which are shifting.

Those people that are benefiting from these shifts take them for granted as they grow in their status and their power, but there's been a tipping point when those groups and the values around them are no longer being reflected and, what's more, they can't even talk about them.

Sean Illing

Hence the political correctness battles are really just another front in the broader culture war.

Pippa Norris

Right. Political correctness is really about the belief that people’s values are being suppressed and that they're no longer respected. They no longer have status. So there’s a group, rightly or wrongly, justly or unjustly, that feels left out.

They tend to be concentrated amongst the older generation, not inevitably but broadly. They tend to be concentrated around the less educated who haven't benefited from college and the changes that brings. And they also tend to be men more than women, whites more than minorities.

Those groups have gone into a kind of minority cultural status, and I think this is the best way to make sense of their reactionary posture.

Sean Illing

Broadly speaking, I think you’re right, though a lot of this, in my view, is just rank hysteria ginned up by xenophobic opportunists. But what you’re describing seems to capture what happened in our most recent election.

Pippa Norris

Trump supporters suddenly got liberated and they felt free to express all of these latent resentments. With Trump, they could express these feelings loudly, and of course Trump himself said these things in a transgressive way. At the same time, those groups that have been benefitting but haven't been voting, like younger people, suddenly felt like their values were under threat and these values are also things which express themselves and then get turned into politics through the ballot box.

Sean Illing

And here we have a recipe for our current dilemma: Older people represent a cultural minority but they vote more than any other group, which is how we end up with a president who is disliked by a majority of Americans but still managed to win the election.

Pippa Norris

Old people vote, young people protest, and those trends mean that older people's values have become disproportionally represented through the political system, and parties and younger people are now out there on the street every day in their pink hats because they feel that their values are under threat.

Basically they think that the America they were complacent about, that was changing, is no longer necessarily representing their views.

Sean Illing

As you know, there are dueling theses about what's really behind the Trump phenomenon: It’s either about economic insecurity or it’s a cultural backlash among older, whiter Americans. You seem firmly in the latter camp.

Pippa Norris

That's right, and the solutions are very different depending on how you interpret what happened. If it's economics, you can go along with the Bernie Sanders solution. You can think of job apprenticeships, such as we've had in Germany, to make sure that blue-collar workers have the skills they need, building up community colleges, improving the minimum wage. You can think about economic redistribution. Parties like Labour under Jeremy Corbyn have certainly adopted those policies in a way to try to get back to the electorate and build up their support, but it basically hasn't worked.

On the other hand, if it's cultural factors, then there's a much deeper problem. It's a problem for liberals in particular. Many of the leaders and members of parties who are active on the left are actually part of the progressive left. They’re well-educated and won't go back on issues like gender equality or issues of race and racism or Islamophobia. So they’re limited in terms of how they can respond to this cultural backlash.

On some of the basic values which Trump's supporters and authoritarians believe, they're not going to reverse. They're not going to simply abandon all evidence-based policy, the emphasis on education and expanding college education or emphasis on gender equality, women's rights or social tolerance in the broadest sense for social diversity because that's built into their DNA.

So progressive forces leading social democratic parties can try to build their support back and they can do some things, but it's much easier for parties on the right to adopt some of the similar language.

Sean Illing

A few months ago, I spoke to another political scientist, Justin Gest of George Mason University, and he was making what seems to me a crucial point, one you’re making here, and that is that Trump voters aren’t opposed to the welfare state or entitlement programs. What they're opposed to is the idea that minorities or other “out” groups are receiving those benefits.

They’re wrong, of course, in believing that minorities are “taking” all of the benefits, but the perception is real nevertheless.

Pippa Norris

That's exactly right. This is welfare chauvinism. It’s about who should get the benefits. Think about Trump: He slashed all sorts of things like the arts, for all the people who go to the opera, or for people like myself, who like NPR. But he doesn't touch in any shape or form Social Security, because Social Security is for the older voters who are voting for him.

On other economic issues, other welfare issues, the budget slashing will have mixed effects on the poorest sections of society. But the perception among a lot of Trump supporters is that these outside groups have come in and “taken” benefits that they don’t deserve, and that therefore they should be penalized.

Sean Illing

Are we witnessing what amounts to a failure of multiculturalism, first in Europe and now in the United States?

Pippa Norris

No, we're actually witnessing the success of multiculturalism: It's taking over in the broader sense in the population and in society. I can give you lots and lots of trends on that. You can look at various polls and surveys measuring things like tolerance of minorities, cosmopolitanism, the attitudes toward the United Nations, toward NATO, toward the European Union, and you find that young people are incredibly cosmopolitan, incredibly multicultural. They see their lives as being one where you work in one country, you live in another, you end up in a third.

But, predictably, there is a reaction against multiculturalism, which is a sign that it has succeeded. Social changes have accelerated multiculturalism, and that is perceived as threatening to those opposed to it. There are immense pressures to adapt and adopt.

We have to think about how best to adapt to multiculturalism, but in terms of broad social attitudes, there's no evidence that, for example, attitudes toward homosexuality or gender or religion are in any way going in a more traditional direction.

Sean Illing

That makes plenty of sense, but this period of disruption could be far worse than anyone anticipated. If, as you seem to suggest, we will get more populism, does that mean we will get more constitutional crises in Western countries?

Pippa Norris

This is a difficult issue. You have to consider three factors when you talk about the impact of populism. You have the institutional rules of the game, things like the Electoral College. If we didn't have the Electoral College, then we'd have Hillary Clinton in the White House. There’s also how parties respond to each other, and that's what you might term the supply side of the equation. Then you also have the public demand, which is the value shifts and the cultural changes.

A lot depends on the type of system a country has. Different systems will respond in different ways to populist pressures. In most European systems, the party system is flexible. In the United Kingdom, for example, you have 13 parties sitting in Parliament. In Netherlands, Germany, and other countries, you've got a multi-party system. In a few countries like the United States, you've only got two parties. Now those parties themselves are umbrellas, so they're ideologically indistinct in certain regards, but it's also very difficult for other parties to break through.

Are there going to be populist parties in the future? Absolutely. They're not going to go away. How successful they are depends on the institutional rules and depends on how other parties respond to them in terms of either taking over their issues, ignoring them, or trying to isolate them in certain regards. But the American system is resistant to major shocks because of the strength of the two-party structure.

Sean Illing

I take your point that America’s two-party system creates high hurdles for outlier parties or movements, but I think this election made clear that institutional barriers won’t save us. It turns out that norms and customs are every bit as important, and those only exist to the extent that people in power respect them.

Pippa Norris

There was a paper written recently by two political scientists, Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk. The New York Times actually reported on it. They argued that Western democracy was in danger because young people around the world don’t support democratic values. In a paper that will be coming out soon in The Journal of Democracy, I challenge this argument.

To say that Western democracies are under threat, there are three kind of factors you need to look out for, and this goes back to our theories of democratic consolidation from the early ’90s. Democracy is stable if, culturally, the overwhelming majority of people believe that democracy is the best form of government, meaning they adhere to the values. Secondly, constitutionally all the basic agencies and organizations of a state have to reflect those democratic norms. Thirdly, no significant groups actively seek to overthrow the regime.

I go through all the evidence and argue that there is some reduced support for democracy amongst young people, but it's mostly under Anglo-American democracies; it’s not universal. I also look for evidence that democracy is slipping at the institutional level across Western democracies. It turns out there is not much evidence for this, and indeed most of the trends go in a positive direction. Most of the slippage that has occurred has been in hybrid regimes in countries like Poland, Hungary, Venezuela, and Mexico, all of which have been under threat for some time.

The biggest threat comes from populism and terrorism. The two things go hand in hand and they feed on each other. They're mutually parasitic in some ways. So those two things together pose the greatest threat to Western democracy. But so far we can't say that they are destroying democracy because there has been pushback.

The ways in which the resistance has organized, the ways in which the courts have been asserted, the ways in which the media has been so critical of the Trump administration. All of our mainstream and legacy media — the New York Times, Vox, the Guardian, the BBC, and many more — are behaving the way they are supposed to behave in resistance to an authoritarian presidency.

Sean Illing

So it’s not time to panic yet?

Pippa Norris

That’s right. It’s not yet Chicken Little time. The courts have done what the courts should do. The media has done what it’s supposed to do. Civil society is still vibrant. The protests are amazing. Young people are energized. Opposition groups like the ACLU are seeing a tremendous spike in contributions.

But we haven’t yet been properly tested. The tests are not in the good times or safe times. The tests are when the major crises occur. There will be another crisis in the next four or eight years, another terror attack or some other emergency.

This will be the real test."

NBC News,"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vjb25vbXkvd2lsbC0yMDE4LXNlZS10cnVtcC1kZWxpdmVyLXByb21pc2VzLWhlLW1hZGUtMjAxNy1uODMzNjAx0gEraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbXAvbmNuYTgzMzYwMQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"President Donald Trump came to the White House in 2017 with a promise of economic growth. On election night, he proclaimed that he was ready to “double down growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world.” Now, as 2018 approaches, the president is still trying to deliver on that plan. He is betting that tax cuts that he just signed into law will help boost U.S. growth prospects.

America's economy is already humming. Growth topped 3 percent in back-to-back quarters in 2017, though annual growth is likely to come in below that, consistent with a general trend going back to the 1990s.

Still, under this president, 1.7 million jobs have been added, while unemployment has fallen to just 4.1 percent, the lowest rate in 17 years. Economists consider a jobless rate below 5 percent to be akin to “full employment.” At that level, demand for workers should drive up the amount companies are willing to pay to keep them on their payrolls.

Even though job hiring is expected to continue in 2018, wages still have room to grow. Average hourly earnings have only risen by 2.5 percent in the past year, which is not much of an improvement.

More dramatic is the climb in the stock market since Trump came to the White House - the S&P 500 stock index has gained 20 percent in 2017.

However, the fact is that President Trump inherited an already booming economy. Markets, jobs, and wages are simply continuing their upward trajectories - and they are likely to continue to do so in 2018.

Yet the stock market is a poor barometer for how most Americans are doing in this economy, because they aren't benefiting from its gains. Only half of Americans even invest in stocks, mostly through their 401(k) and other retirement accounts. And, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, 80 percent of market gains only benefit the top 10 percent of earners.

Now, critics are warning that businesses and the wealthy will mostly profit from the president's tax reform package.

“What the middle class really does need are jobs and wage growth,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served the Obama White House as chief economist and senior adviser.

“The whole trickle-down sales job has been belied by every historical example of these kinds of cuts,” he said.

The Trump administration disputes his claim, citing its own research that slashing corporate rates will increase worker incomes by $4,000 a year or more.

But critics question the White House's numbers. The author behind the research, Kevin Hassett, who leads Trump’s Council on Economic Advisers, said he studied other countries that have made similar tax cuts.

“The fact is that countries around the world have cut their corporate rates and had broad-based reforms on the individual side and seen economic growth, as a result,” he told reporters in October.

Whatever the case, it's clear that President Trump is banking on big business and the country's rich to grow the economy even more for all Americans. It remains to be seen if he can succeed."

I was shooting with him just last week in and around his home in Palo Alto for a story on his new book, “The Driver in the Driverless Car,” and his forecast of an imminent job crisis caused by high technology and what we as a society should do about it. (He does embrace technological change, however, in the form, for example, of the canned prosecco he served from his refrigerator.)

And more to the point, high tech in the form his Tesla, which can already do a lot of the driverless driving, including parking itself in Vivek’s garage by remote control — somewhat haltingly — as this brief 1:33 video clip demonstrates:

An immigrant from India, Vivek has been a staunch — some would say “strident” — supporter of diversity, especially in high tech, where he has found it lamentably lacking with regard to both gender and race. So it was with some surprise that I read in my inbox an email from Vivek linking to a new post of his, which ran on the Washington Post’s webpage.

Vivek prefaced it with the following note:

“I received a request from MSNBC for an interview on air by Ali Velshi immediately after a White House press conference on Trump’s new immigration bill. I expected that the proposed legislation would be as outrageous as Trump’s Muslim ban and that this interview would take me a step closer to a Trump tweet calling me a duffer. But the bill made sense to me. It needs to be revised substantially but is a step in the right direction. U.S. immigration policy is badly in need of an overhaul, and the focus on bringing in people who add to economic growth and competitiveness is good for the country.

“Frankly, I don’t see why the U.S. needs diversity lotteries when it is already diverse, and why immigrants shouldn’t be required to speak English. Centuries ago, it may not have been possible for a person in one country to learn the language of another, but now anyone anywhere can download an app and watch YouTube videos.”

“This article is surely going to create a backlash,” Vivek concluded — “because it goes against the common narrative in the media. But I felt obliged to speak my mind.”

Perhaps that backlash starts here.

— Paul Solman, economics correspondent

The following column originally ran on the Washington Post.

My first reaction to the headlines about President Trump’s proposal to cut immigration in half was that it would be as disastrous as his Muslim ban. But after reading details of the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment Act (RAISE Act), I can’t find a reason to be outraged. The legislation surely needs to be improved, and the numbers of immigrants admitted increased. But it could be good for the country, because it gives preference to the job creators and professionals who have for too long taken a backseat in the debates about comprehensive immigration reform.

The restrictions on families are by no means a good thing, but the focus on bringing in people who contribute to U.S. economic growth surely is.

The president has proposed dramatic changes to U.S. immigration policy, shifting its focus from admitting family members to admitting people based on their skills, English-speaking ability, education, employability, age, achievement and entrepreneurial initiative. At a news conference announcing the bill, Trump adviser Stephen Miller stressed that the families of present immigrants would be grandfathered in under the new rules, but indicated that future immigrants would not be able to sponsor adult children or siblings unless they met the new requirements.

The restrictions on families are by no means a good thing, but the focus on bringing in people who contribute to U.S. economic growth surely is. And as far as learning English goes, almost anyone anywhere can now download language-learning apps and watch videos on their smartphones; immigrants should come prepared.

The United States has been experiencing an exodus of highly skilled workers who were frustrated by an immigration system that put them at a disadvantage. This helped other countries gain a competitive advantage. Chinese internet companies, such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, are among the most innovative and valuable companies in the world. Chinese scientists are building advanced artificial intelligence and gene-editing technologies. Indian engineers are launching sophisticated rockets and creating new platforms for digital currencies. And if you look at the “unicorns,” technology startup firms valued at $1 billion or more, you see that China and India are home to one-third of them, although as recently as 2000, nearly all of them were in the United States, leaving other countries only dreaming of creating a Google, Amazon or Facebook.

We have been bleeding talent and boosting our global competition while arguing only about the plight of undocumented workers.

Most of these foreign research labs and companies have returnees from the United States in key leadership positions. My research team at Duke and Harvard documented that before the immigrant exodus began, 52 percent of Silicon Valley’s startups had been founded by immigrants — and that U.S. immigration policies led this to fall to 44 percent. This was because we were admitting large numbers of workers and students on temporary visas such as the H-1B, but not providing enough green cards. By my estimate, as many as 1.5 million skilled workers and their families are waiting for green cards in the United States today, but we admit only 120,000 workers every year in the top three employment-based categories of permanent-resident visas. So highly skilled workers are leaving.

We have been bleeding talent and boosting our global competition while arguing only about the plight of undocumented workers. It makes sense to solve the relatively easy problems first and then address the ultra-contentious issues of illegal immigration.

The proposal that Trump presented is supposedly based on the merit-based immigration systems of Canada and Australia and similar to what President George W. Bush had proposed in 2007 in a comprehensive immigration reform bill that didn’t make it through the Senate. The same debates are likely break out again, with political leaders on both sides objecting to the exclusion of legal, low-skilled immigrants, who are crucial to the economies of such states as South Carolina.

We need both skilled and unskilled workers as well as musicians and artists, and one way to resolve the issue may be to expand temporary visa programs for low-skilled workers and to value soft skills more highly in the new system. Of critical importance also is to provide permanent residency to the more than 1 million undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. Of these, 750,000 received work permits and deportation relief through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy that President Barack Obama created. Their security in being able to remain is a human rights issue and, as I have previously written, concerns America’s very soul.

Today the most important challenge is for the United States to maintain its global competitiveness — and create new jobs for Americans. This is what immigration can do.

I expect that the debates in the House and the Senate will lead to significant improvements in the RAISE Act, though its passage is far from guaranteed. But with the new focus on skilled immigration, the president has made an important change to the subject of the debate. U.S. immigration is badly in need of modernization. Visas such as the diversity visa, which Trump is also seeking to eliminate, made sense a few decades ago when the United States truly did lack diversity, but today the most important challenge is for the United States to maintain its global competitiveness — and create new jobs for Americans. This is what immigration can do."

Today’s target is a big one: the fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks.

In 2011, the Obama administration began crafting sweeping new rules that would steadily increase the efficiency of US passenger vehicles through 2025. By the final year, the Environmental Protection Agency expects new cars and light trucks sold in the US to average roughly 36 miles per gallon on the road, up from 25 mpg today.

These rules are hardly an ideal climate policy, since they only apply to new cars (not the millions of cars already on the road), and since they’ve been undercut by cheap oil and the growing popularity of SUVs. But it’s one of the few federal programs aimed at greening the US transportation sector, which accounts for one-third of carbon dioxide emissions. And the car rules were a centerpiece of President Obama’s climate agenda, along with the Clean Power Plan (which Trump is planning to dismantle):

So that brings us to today’s news. Obama’s vehicle standards are largely locked in through 2021, but they can still be altered for 2022 to 2025. As one of its final acts, Obama’s EPA raced to finish a scheduled “midterm evaluation” that concluded the standards should be kept in place without changes through 2025. But the Department of Transportation hasn’t yet signed on, giving Trump an opening to revisit the rules.

At an event with automakers in Michigan, Trump is announcing that he’ll tell the EPA to redo that midterm evaluation. Once that's done, the EPA could work with the Department of Transportation to develop new — and possibly less stringent — vehicle standards for 2022 to 2025. US automakers have asked Trump to rethink Obama’s proposed rules, which they call overly aggressive and costly to meet. Depending on what tweaks are ultimately made, this could increase US carbon emissions.

""I think every [automaker] that produces SUVs and pickups will benefit from a rollback,"" Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, told reporters at the Geneva Motor Show.

Except there’s a major twist here. Technically, if the federal government goes too far in weakening Obama’s fuel economy standards, California has a waiver under the Clean Air Act allowing the state to maintain its own, stricter car rules that other states can adopt — a messy possibility that automakers hate. On top of that, California has a waiver for a program pushing automakers to sell more “zero-emissions vehicles” (mainly electric cars). New York and eight other states have also adopted this ZEV mandate, and it’s a major impetus for US electric car sales.

In the months ahead, Trump could conceivably ask EPA head Scott Pruitt to look into rescinding California’s waivers if the state won’t play along. This isn’t part of today’s announcement, and it’s wildly unclear if the courts would even allow this, but Trump’s reportedly mulling such a step. If he does go after the waivers, that could potentially put a major damper on electric car sales in the years ahead. It’s a big deal, so let’s take a closer look at how this all works.

How Obama’s vehicle rules work (and why they’re so absurdly complex)

If you want to understand Obama’s fuel economy standards, it’s important to realize that these are basically three different rules rolled into one — which makes any changes ... complicated. Here are the key players involved:

The Department of Transportation is required to set Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for new cars and trucks under a 2007 energy bill signed by George W. Bush. That bill directs CAFE levels to rise on a fixed schedule through 2020 and then tells the agency to set fuel economy standards at a “maximum feasible level” each year after that, based on what’s technologically and economically practical. The Environmental Protection Agency is, separately, required to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles under the Clean Air Act, thanks to a 2007 Supreme Court decision and a follow-up 2009 agency determination that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. (It’s unlikely Pruitt can repeal this requirement.) California, meanwhile, is allowed to develop its own vehicle emissions rules that are stricter than the federal government’s — so long as it receives a waiver from the EPA. (This waiver program exists because when the Clean Air Act was written in the 1970s, California’s smog problem was especially bad.) In 2004, California passed a big climate change law and asked for an EPA waiver to develop its own greenhouse gas standards for cars — standards that other states could adopt as well. That waiver was initially denied under Bush, but later granted under Obama.

As you might suspect, it’d be a nightmare for automakers if all three entities issued vastly different rules. So in 2011, the Obama administration brought everyone together to hammer out a single, relatively coherent set of fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks that would rise continuously between 2012 and 2025. As part of that deal, all entities agreed to conduct a midterm review by 2018, to see if the rules needed adjusting at all.

The resulting vehicle standards are incredibly complex — in part to make compliance easier. They apply to entire fleets, so automakers can build some cars that get poor mileage and some that get great mileage, as long as it all averages out. The rules are also “footprint-based,” which means larger vehicles face looser standards (though standards for all vehicles rise over time). If American consumers unexpectedly start buying bigger SUVs, then fleetwide fuel economy naturally goes down. Automakers can also get credit for things like improving the efficiency of the air conditioners or by selling more electric vehicles.

But despite the loopholes, these rules have encouraged automakers to build more efficient cars, by using lighter materials, by harnessing advanced engine technologies such as gasoline direct injection, and by selling more hybrids. Today, the average fuel economy of new vehicles is around 25.1 miles per gallon on the road, up from 20.8 mpg in 2007.

(Notice that fuel economy has stagnated since 2014; that’s when oil prices crashed and Americans began buying larger cars and more SUVs. That shift in vehicle mix has temporarily counteracted the efficiency improvements.)

In late 2016, both Obama’s EPA and California’s Air Resources Board raced to finish their scheduled midterm evaluations of the rules before Trump took office. Both agencies concluded, after rifling through various technical studies, that automakers were more than capable of meeting Obama’s proposed standards through 2025 — even with low oil prices — and that no changes were necessary. If anything, the EPA argued, the standards could even stand to be even stricter.

By 2025, the EPA noted, new cars and light trucks on the road would average about 36 miles per gallon on the road under Obama’s proposed rules (you sometimes see this reported as 54.5 mpg, but that’s a different metric). The standards would add about $875 to the average sticker price of new models, but consumers would save roughly three times that much in lower fuel costs over the lifetime of their vehicles.

Why Trump wants to revisit the rules (and why they’re hard to change)

Many automakers, however, would prefer looser rules from 2022 to 2025, since it already costs billions of dollars to comply and the standards only get tougher over time. And once Trump got elected president, they saw an opening.

In a February letter to the Trump administration, the Auto Alliance trade group argued that Obama’s proposed 2022-2025 vehicle standards would be far too difficult to meet, requiring automakers to produce large numbers of hybrids and electric vehicles that consumers are less keen on buying in this era of low oil prices. This situation, they argued, risked “driving up vehicle prices and depressing auto sales.”

What’s more, the Auto Alliance argued that Obama’s EPA moved too hastily to finish its midterm evaluation before Trump came to office — way ahead of the 2018 deadline — and hence didn’t have time to consider forthcoming technical evidence from the auto industry showing Obama’s standards were unduly burdensome.

As such, the trade group asked the EPA to withdraw Obama’s midterm evaluation and write a new one in conjunction with the Department of Transportation, which has not yet signed on to final standards. Presumably, automakers aim to lobby for rules between 2022 and 2025 that are easier to meet.

So that’s what Trump is doing today — he’s telling the EPA to revisit that midterm review. That part is simple enough. Experts say there’s no serious legal hurdle for the EPA to redo its review and take into account new information.

The hard part comes if the EPA and Department of Transportation later decide to rewrite the fuel economy standards for 2022-’25 to be less strict. They can’t just abolish the standards altogether, because of the underlying laws involved. Instead, they might try to relax the schedule for efficiency improvements, or make compliance easier by giving automakers more credit for non-engine improvements. Yet any changes would require the EPA to write a new regulation, which has to go through the formal rulemaking process and could be challenged in court.

Bob Sussman, a lawyer who was senior policy counsel at the EPA under Obama, explains that Trump officials would have to make a detailed case that the Obama-era standards are too costly to meet — say, because they depend on selling large numbers of electric vehicles that consumers are unwilling to buy. “It’s not an easy case to make,” Sussman says. “It’s very fact-intensive and highly technical.”

Assuming the EPA and the Department of Transportation can pull that off, however, there’s still another potential hurdle. Remember, California received a waiver from the EPA to pursue its own stricter standards if the federal government pulls back — and states like New York would likely adopt California’s rules. Automakers loathe this possibility, because it would mean a messy patchwork of standards across different states.

So that brings us to the waiver issue...

Trump may be setting the stage for a big showdown with California

If California becomes too troublesome here, Trump could in theory ask Pruitt to rescind the state’s waivers under the Clean Air Act in the months ahead. Trump hasn’t said he’d do this yet, but he’s reportedly considering it. Rescinding a waiver has basically never been done before — and there are two options here:

Pruitt could try to rescind the waiver California got to establish its own fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. If he did this, all states would simply have to follow the federal rules — even if the Trump administration weakened them.

Much more drastically, Pruitt could try to rescind a second waiver California received in 2013 to create its zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) program, which requires a certain percentage of automaker sales in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles — such as electric cars or hydrogen vehicles. Currently, nine other states have adopted this ZEV mandate, and it’s a key driver of electric vehicle sales.

If Pruitt attempted to do this — which, again, is not something that’s been proposed for now — he’d immediately be challenged in court by California, setting the stage for a major showdown. The Trump administration might argue, as the Bush administration did, that the waiver program was meant to help California solve local pollution problems unique to the state — such as severe smog in cities like Los Angeles. It was never intended to address a global problem like climate change.

For now, environmental groups feel confident California would prevail. “EPA would need to contradict the extensive evidence in the record supporting California’s current waiver, a difficult feat, and one likely to be rejected in court,” write Irene Gutierrez and David Pettit of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Courts look with skepticism on agency policy reversals contradicting earlier factual findings.”

So it’s possible that Trump won’t even try to go after California — and instead, the EPA and Transportation Department will just try to work with the state to develop rules that everyone’s happy with. But it’s also possible we’ll see a showdown.

If California’s ZEV program gets killed, that would be a huge blow to electric cars

There are a few ways to think through what would happen if Trump were to weaken the fuel economy standards and/or rescind California’s waivers.

If the standards for cars and light trucks get relaxed, then oil consumption and greenhouse gases will very likely go up. In its midterm review, the EPA estimated that Obama’s proposed 2022-’25 standards would reduce US oil consumption by roughly 1.2 billion barrels over the lifetime of the vehicles and reduce US carbon dioxide emissions by 540 million metric tons. A weaker rule would achieve fewer savings. (For context, the US consumes about 7 billion barrels of oil each year.)

The flip side, says Sam Ori, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, is that the bulk of the savings from Obama’s fuel economy rule have come from the standards that are already locked into place. That’s at least 3 billion barrels of oil over the lifetime of the vehicles, by some estimates. “That’s not going away no matter what the Trump administration does,” Ori says.

But on the off-chance that Pruitt goes even further and manages to rescind the waiver for California’s ZEV program, that could potentially be a much bigger deal, particularly for the electric car market. “The ZEV mandate is what’s driving most of the growth we’re seeing in electric vehicles,” says David Cooke of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

If the ZEV rules get repealed, that would be a big blow to the electric vehicle market, says John Graham, the former administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under George W. Bush who worked extensively on fuel-economy issues. “Tesla’s business model would be hurt without the California ZEV regulation because Tesla generates significant revenue from the sale of ZEV credits to other vehicle manufacturers,” Graham tells me. “Several manufacturers have stated publicly that they would not be offering plug-in electric vehicles were it not for the California requirements.”

Any ZEV rollback would also be a major setback for California’s climate ambitions. The state currently has about 230,000 zero-emission vehicles and plug-in hybrids registered — about half the national total. But the state’s ambitious plan for cutting emissions calls for putting 1.5 million of those cars on the road by 2025, and 4.2 million on the road by 2030. That’s extraordinarily difficult to do if the mandate gets repealed.

To be sure, rescinding the order wouldn’t mean the death of all electric cars. “Some manufacturers (e.g., Nissan, Tesla, and GM) would probably continue to offer electric vehicles, even without the ZEV requirements,” says Graham. And, of course, other countries like China and Norway continue to aggressively push pro-electric-car policies, which will influence the types of cars automakers produce.

And over time, if the technology continues to improve, electric cars should catch on even without mandates. “In the long run,” says Graham, “if battery prices continue to decline rapidly, the electric vehicle will not be dependent on the ZEV waiver, as it will be able to compete in the marketplace on its own virtues.”

Still, the long run can take an awfully long time to arrive. So, for now, this will be worth watching closely.

NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman spoke with the economist and historian Adam Tooze about Trump’s approach to trade and globalization for a Making $ense segment airing Thursday. Their conversation is published here, edited for length and clarity.

PAUL SOLMAN: Of all the countries in the world, what country, besides the United States, could essentially operate on its own?

ADAM TOOZE: One of the deeper logics behind the Trump program is [the idea] that for the United States, of all the economies in the world, this makes the most sense. That’s not saying that most economists would agree that this is, indeed, an optimal economic policy. But it’s one which in the American case, the costs and benefits are relatively favorable. It’s not an option, for instance, for Singapore or Hong Kong. It’s not an option, even, for a society like Germany, which is fundamentally reliant on trade. In the United States, a relatively small fraction of jobs are dependent, fundamentally dependent, on export.

PAUL SOLMAN: So then, what is the economic historian’s argument against doing it?

ADAM TOOZE: I think the main argument against doing it is one orientated towards the future. The question really is the role of trade in long-run economic development. It’s a question of the role of trade, and foreign investment, both imports and exports, the entire metabolism, if you like, of America’s relationship with the world economy in any future vision of the United States in the 21st century. The idea that the United States economy could subsist within the bubble — the very ample bubble of American resources — deep into the 21st century, I think strikes most people as frankly surprising that that’s even [considered as] an attractive vision. The United States has done well, on average, in general, with globalization. There have been losers, but there have been more winners than there have been losers, and most people I think continue to regard a strategy of globalization as a winning strategy for the United States.

PAUL SOLMAN: Is there not evidence from history that globalization can be a losing strategy?

ADAM TOOZE: There are societies arguably for which it has been very difficult, but they tend to be middle-income societies, societies which get caught, if you like, between the powerhouse tech centers of Silicon Valley, and the powerhouse, low-cost manufacturing sectors of China. It’s not a comfortable place to be in that middle zone. But the United States, as a whole, has what it takes in terms of technology and resources to comfortably position itself at the top of the value chain. The questions for the United States are really about internal distribution, how the United States, as a society, as a political system, copes with the difference between the winners and the losers internally.

The United States, as a whole, has what it takes to comfortably position itself at the top of the value chain.

One way I think to describe the program being offered by the new administration is to say we want to opt out of that difficult problem, we want to opt out of that challenge of arbitrating and balancing within the United States between the winners and losers of globalization. That’s going to be our first move, is we’re actually going to force a renegotiation of the terms of globalization, and if necessary, step back from it altogether. That’s going to be the ultimate threat, that we will opt out. As opposed to engaging in the creative politics of trying to balance between the two sides.

If you think back to the first phase in which America really systematically promoted globalization, from the 1930s onwards, it was never without challenges, but the response of the American government was to engage in the difficult business of balancing between winners and losers in that process. Whether it was through unemployment insurance, or whether it was through various types of structural support, for agriculture for instance, or whether it was through heavy investment in R and D or heavy investment in education. And I think historically speaking, what’s interesting about this moment, is that this administration seems to want to pull back from that entire process.

PAUL SOLMAN: And so what do we lose as a consequence?

ADAM TOOZE: There are very large parts of the U.S. economy which have benefitted enormously from globalization. The sorts of sectors which feature so largely in the Trump program. [But they] account now for perhaps only about 15 percent of the American workforce. Manufacturing, industry, mining, construction, heavy, manual, blue collar work — the kind of image that defines a certain image of middle America. But it’s 15 percent of the workforce.

The vast majority of Americans are employed in service sector industries, they’re overwhelmingly female rather than male workers, and many of those sectors are highly internationalized. The most high value-added sectors, notably the tech sector, is massively globalized. Likewise, various types of financial services, and those are export industries, sectors in which America dominates global trade, and global commerce, and for them it will be a disaster if America’s trade policy was to go down, spiraling down towards protectionism.

PAUL SOLMAN: Well, but won’t the rest of the world still want those products, those cutting edge products?

ADAM TOOZE: There’s no doubt that America has leverage in all of those sectors, but the world is globalizing incredibly rapidly over the last 20 to 30 years. Looking back historically, we’ve seen an extraordinary transformation in the global division of labor. There are very few sectors now in which the United States, or any other western economy, has an absolute lock on the technology that can’t be replicated anywhere else in the world. And so this is not a setting in which you necessarily want to get into a tit for tat, beggar-thy-neighbor, trade war style situation.

This is a world which is highly competitive, in which we need to be thinking about complex balances in which rich countries import manufactured and agricultural product from lower and middle-income countries, in exchange for a flow of high tech, high value-added manufactured and service exports. Those complex negotiations also [play out] across supply chains — so we no longer manufacture the entire car in one place, but we manufacture some of the parts in Mexico, and some of the other parts in Europe, and then they’re all assembled, perhaps, in a factory in Kentucky. Those kinds of complex supply chains are all jeopardized if you engage in a tit for tat, aggressive protectionist trade policy."

But he will struggle to get things all his own way.

President Donald Trump last week issued a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, reversing the decision of his predecessor and fulfilling his own campaign promise. If built, Keystone would enable oil to be shipped from the Canadian tar sands to refineries along the US Gulf of Mexico. Nature has argued previously that the Keystone decision is more symbolic than significant: broader economic and political forces will ultimately determine how much and what kind of oil the world will burn in the coming decades. From this perspective, the US government’s position on Keystone is most significant as a sure and unsettling sign of how the political winds are blowing.

Former president Barack Obama rejected the pipeline on moral grounds, saying that it would undermine US leadership on global warming, and there is some truth to this. The executive office has broad authority to determine whether Keystone — a major investment in fossil-fuel infrastructure when the world is trying to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions — is in the “national interest”. Obama said no. Trump, focused instead on short-term jobs and the fossil-fuel industry at large, said yes.

It could be hard for the Trump administration to push its agenda onto other countries.

Trump may have breathed life into the project, but its future remains uncertain. The drop in global oil prices has reduced the short-term profitability of the tar sands, and the long term is even murkier, given the global trend towards low-carbon energy. Some energy giants are losing interest in tar sands, and the Keystone pipeline’s developer, TransCanada, will face innumerable challenges from environmentalists as it seeks to push the project forward in the coming years. In the same way that Obama ultimately could not guarantee that the pipeline would not be built, Trump cannot guarantee that it will be.

Keystone is just one small piece of the energy agenda, and the reality is that Trump’s singular focus on fossil fuels is at odds with economic and political realities. Renewable energies such as solar and wind are on the rise in the United States and abroad, and are now attracting more investment than fossil fuels. Coal’s US decline is likely to continue regardless of Trump’s promises, because the fuel is losing out to cheap natural gas, falling prices for renewables, and air-quality regulations that would be exceedingly hard to dismantle.

And then there’s the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which Trump has pledged both to cancel and to consider with an open mind. His secretary of state, former ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson, believes that the United States should remain engaged. This might be an indication that walking away from the Paris process would be difficult, given the international diplomatic backlash that would surely ensue, but the Trump administration could still wreak plenty of havoc.

The US stance is hard to predict, but one glimpse came last week from Republican representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who advised Trump on energy issues during the campaign. Cramer has been seeking co-signatories for a letter to Trump that lays out conditions if the United States is to remain party to the accord. Most importantly, the letter says that the country should withdraw its current commitment — to cut emissions to at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025 — and issue a new pledge that protects fossil-fuel interests and US industry.

Cramer’s letter highlights the role of innovation, which is important. Unfortunately, the sole focus is on technologies that could make fossil fuels cleaner, such as carbon capture and sequestration. The United States is, of course, welcome to advance climate-friendly technologies for fossil fuels, and the world would certainly benefit if it succeeded. However, this would mean investing in climate-related research and development as well as crafting economic policies that reward the fruits of such labours. A few brave Republicans are beginning to talk about climate solutions, but Cramer’s party as a whole won’t even acknowledge that there is a problem to solve."

The answer lies in the failure of the political system to address, or even acknowledge, small-town economic struggles.

Some nine months into the Trump presidency, the central questions of the 2016 election continue to weigh heavy. Why did the white rural electorate vote so heavily for Donald Trump? According to exit polls, he defeated Hillary Clinton by an almost two-to-one margin in rural and small-town America. Trump achieved his largest margins among white rural men (72 percent to 24 percent). But he still bested Hillary Clinton by 28 points among white rural women, an astounding achievement for a man who openly boasted of sexual misconduct and was running against the nation’s first female presidential frontrunner.

In assessments of Trump’s rural landslide, cultural forces have received far greater weight than economic interests. In June, the Washington Post concluded from polling data that “The political divide between rural and urban America is more cultural than it is economic, rooted in rural residents’ deep misgivings about the nation’s rapidly changing demographics, their sense that Christianity is under siege and their perception that the federal government caters most to the needs of people in big cities.” Rural economic decline, and in particular the struggles of the industrial sector, have been deemed of secondary importance. While the demise of rural manufacturing was a persistent theme in Trump’s campaign rhetoric, one he returned to in his inaugural address when he pointed to the “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation,” many commentators have dismissed its impact on voting behavior.

Economic interpretations of Trumpism have failed to convince many, in large part, because so few are aware of rural America’s industrial history. In fact, the expansion of manufacturing has been a centerpiece of the economic agenda of politicians in the rural Midwest since the end of the Second World War. And changes in the pattern of presidential voting in that region closely parallels the ups and downs of the industrial economy there. Election returns since the 1950s paint a picture of a rural and small-town electorate acutely sensitive to economic trends.

A rural Arkansas newspaper proclaimed in 1954, “It is the dream and ambition of every small town to become an industrial center. Practically every chamber of commerce has an industrial committee . . . looking for new industry and new payrolls. Go into practically any town and ask the first man you see what his town needs most and chances are that he will say ‘more industry.’” Originating in the 1940s, this crusade for rural industrial development achieved its greatest successes in the 1960s and ‘70s. Although industrialization would slacken in the 1980s and ‘90s, manufacturing remained a pillar of the rural economy throughout the twentieth century. However, the precipitous decline in manufacturing employment since 2000 has roiled rural areas, producing the kinds of misery and instability that helped fuel the success of Donald Trump.

To understand this history, a fruitful place to look is southern Iowa. A predominantly white rural area, southern Iowa experienced some of the largest Republican gains in the nation in last year’s election. In 2016, the GOP vote margin was 25 percent higher in southern Iowa than it had been in 2012. As elsewhere in the rural Midwest, the farm population of southern Iowa decreased markedly in the middle of the twentieth century, causing a decades-long economic crisis that informed all political developments. The decline was shaped by patterns in employment: Many farmers invested in labor-saving machinery, commercial pesticides, and other advancements in an effort to maximize productivity. These actions not only decreased demand for farm labor, they also created a hypercompetitive environment that forced millions of small producers out of the agricultural sector. Most small farmers sold their holdings to large operators, leaving fewer, larger agribusinesses in the area.

Farm families that “sold out” generally left rural areas and went in search of work elsewhere. Between 1920 and 1960, the farm population in Appanoose County, along the border with Missouri, declined more than 60 percent from 12,252 to 4,815. With fewer people, rural institutions struggled to survive. Businesses and banks failed. Country churches shuttered their doors and boarded their windows without farm families to fill the collection plate. Residents expressed fears that their communities would become ghost towns.

Rural blight spurred calls for industrial development. Towns in southern Iowa sent business delegations to metropolitan areas in an attempt to pilfer urban manufacturers. They offered potential investors a myriad of subsidies, such as ready-made factory buildings, low-interests loans, and tax breaks. To attract mobile capital, towns resurfaced roads, updated water and sewage systems, enhanced electrical networks, beautified municipal buildings, and even built airports. Communities financed these improvements by selling municipal bonds or lobbying for government aid (both state and federal).

These efforts would prove rewarding, as southern Iowa benefited from a national expansion of rural manufacturing in the 1960s and ‘70s. Over those two decades, for example, Appanoose County acquired six major new industries, including a branch plant of Union Carbide, and added close to 1,900 new industrial jobs—when the total county population numbered only around 15,000.

A grassroots pro-business movement came to dominate politics in southern Iowa. Much like their counterparts in the Sunbelt (as Elizabeth Tandy Shermer has documented), boosters worked to improve southern Iowa’s “business climate,” supporting anti-union policies such as the state’s right-to-work law. Local business elites also attempted to engineer the tax code at every level of government, emphasizing property and sales taxes over business levies in an effort to shift the burden from corporations to consumers and homeowners.

At the same time, small-town business leaders favored generous government spending, so long as funds were put to “productive” uses. Local boosters applauded the state and federal government for underwriting better roads and utilities. To square robust spending with low business taxes, boosters emphasized the need for government “efficiency,” arguing that the elimination of waste in the public sector would save a tremendous amount of money. (This position was always more of an ideological fix than economic reality, as there was never enough fat to trim to make up for these contradictory policies.)

Since the end of the Second World War, presidential voting patterns in rural southern Iowa have tracked closely with the region’s industrial ups and downs. During the 1930s and ‘40s, rural southern Iowans were torn between their traditional loyalty to the Republican Party and the obvious economic benefits of New Deal liberalism. This contributed to Iowa’s schizophrenic voting behavior, producing Democratic presidential majorities in 1932, 1936, and 1948 and Republican victories in 1940 and 1944. As industrial development took hold in the postwar period, however, rural southern Iowans gravitated towards “middle-of-the-road” Republican candidates, whose business-friendly policy prescriptions seemed to promise industrial growth. The election of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 initiated two decades of heavy Republican voting in the state, with the exception of the Johnson landslide in 1964.

But a rapid slowdown in rural industrial growth in the mid-1970s brought increasing partisan competition to the countryside. In 1976, Jimmy Carter nearly split the national rural vote with Gerald Ford (47 percent to 53 percent), while winning nearly every county in southern Iowa. Appanoose County, which had lost several major manufacturing plants during the Ford years, gave 52 percent of its vote to Carter. In large part, this political opening was facilitated by a rightward drift in the Democratic Party, as New Deal liberalism gave way to a centrist politics more closely aligned with business demands. Southern Iowans returned to the Republican fold during the Reagan era. But after a dismal showing by the rural industrial economy during the 1980s, with many firms closing as a result of the Reagan Recession and tight monetary policies, the region was once again in revolt. In 1988, most counties in southern Iowa voted for Michael Dukakis over George H. W. Bush, which helped the Democrat win the state by ten points.

Due in large part to his inability to fix the domestic economy, Bush lost the state again in 1992, this time to Bill Clinton. Raised nearby in Arkansas, Clinton handily won southern Iowa that year. Four years later, on the back of strong economic growth and an upsurge in rural manufacturing, he actually won a larger percentage of the vote in small-town America than did his opponent, Bob Dole, and crushed the Republican nominee in the southern part of Iowa.

Though rural industrial development grew increasingly volatile after the mid-1970s, manufacturing remained a vital part of the nonmetropolitan economy until 2000. But since the turn of the century, the countryside’s industrial economy has been in a downward spiral. The economic recession of 2001 marked the beginning of a tremendous decline in manufacturing employment. China’s admittance into the World Trade Organization in 2001 (guaranteeing it permanent normal trading relations with the United States) spurred a massive relocation of manufacturing abroad. Attempting to keep up in a competitive global economy, many U.S. manufacturers tried to cut costs and increase productivity by replacing workers with sophisticated computerized machinery. The manufacturing sector took another major hit when the American economy collapsed in 2008. During the 2000s, the United States shed a whopping 5.9 million manufacturing jobs, representing a decrease of 33.8 percent.

Rural and small-town areas were hard hit by these developments. Some of the industries most vulnerable to foreign competition, such as textiles and apparel, were concentrated in rural areas. Many rural industries that were tied to home construction, such as wood products, cement, glass, and ceramics, suffered as a result of the housing market crash in 2008. Between 2000 and 2010, nonmetropolitan areas slightly outpaced the nation as a whole in industrial job loss, witnessing a 35 percent decline in manufacturing employment.

In southern Iowa, a slew of plant closures plagued the local economy. In 2006, Rubbermaid decided to close down its branch plant in Centerville, resulting in the loss of more than 500 jobs. A twenty-one year mainstay of Centerville and Appanoose County, the firm chose to close up shop despite generous incentives offered by state officials The Rubbermaid closure was part of a larger restructuring bedeviling the region. In 2013, Gits Manufacturing announced that it would be closing its operations in the town of Creston, shifting production to plants in Mexico and China. The factory, which produced valves for diesel engines, had been a fixture of the local community since 1945. Although rural manufacturing employment in the state and nation has rebounded modestly in the last few years, the growth has been too slow to make up for the jobs that have been lost.

A decade ago, this downturn helped fuel a Democratic comeback in southern Iowa and in rural areas across the country. In the 2006 midterm elections, Democrats flipped Iowa’s second congressional district, which encompasses many southern counties. In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama received 45 percent of the national rural vote, while John McCain garnered 53 percent. While African-American voters in the Deep South no doubt contributed to this strong showing, Obama ran remarkably well in predominantly white rural Iowa, winning fifty-two of the state’s ninety-nine counties, many of which were nonmetropolitan. In southern Iowa, Obama won several counties, with McCain garnering slim majorities in most others.

Given the relative openness of rural voters to Barack Obama amid the economic turmoil of 2008, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the eventual triumph of Donald Trump in the American countryside reflects the failure of the political system to address, or even acknowledge, rural economic struggles.

Rural and small-town America never fully recovered from the Great Recession. In urban areas, overall employment achieved a complete rebound, far exceeding its pre-recession numbers by 2015. In rural areas, however, employment has languished, with 2015 totals well below what they had been in 2007. The cataclysmic decline in nonmetropolitan manufacturing is almost certainly to blame for this lag. By the end of the twentieth century, rural and small-town areas were much more dependent on manufacturing than are cities, where finance and service industries have created abundant new jobs.

In 2012, neither major political party made a serious attempt to address the plight of rural America. Mitt Romney had spent much of his business career in a private equity firm known for laying off workers after making millions through leveraged buyouts. Many of Barack Obama’s achievements, especially expanded health care coverage, no doubt alleviated suffering throughout the countryside. But neither Obama’s campaign rhetoric nor his economic policies specifically targeted the structural employment crisis that plagued the countryside. Low rural voter turnout in 2012 reflected widespread disenchantment with a political establishment either unwilling or unable to deal with the countryside’s economic ordeal. This sense of neglect made rural Americans more receptive to outsider candidates and unconventional political rhetoric. What happened in 2012 made white rural Americans open to the kind of messages that Trump would make to them four years later.

Trump’s consistent message about lost manufacturing jobs, “disastrous” trade policies, and “crippling” regulations clearly struck a chord with white people in the countryside who had been raised on a tradition of pro-business policies. Many of his positions had been articles of faith in rural and small-town America since Eisenhower had been president.

Trump’s promises to free up money for vast infrastructural improvements by eliminating bureaucratic waste and corruption mirrored small-town business leaders’ vision of “good government.” His guarantee that he would personally bargain with manufacturing companies who were considering relocation resonated with a chamber-of-commerce political culture that revolved around face-to-face negotiations.

While Trump’s ascent obviously gives cause for concern, there is hope yet for the left in the story of rural American industry. Since entering office, the Trump administration has so far failed to achieve most of its domestic priorities, save for the gutting of environmental regulations and a draconian crackdown on immigrants (which itself is meeting resistance in rural areas as well as urban). Neither has done much to keep the administration’s support from sliding. If the latest failure to repeal Obamacare is any indication, Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will struggle to deliver on major campaign promises to rural America, including legislation to modernize the countryside’s infrastructure. Given Trump’s lofty campaign rhetoric and high voter expectations, failure to significantly improve the rural economy will almost certainly produce widespread disillusionment. If the recent oscillations of the rural electorate are any indication, many voters will abandon Trump if they do not see their material situation improved. Democrats have an opportunity to capitalize on this potential fallout, but they will need to offer a vision of rural economic revitalization. (In its grasping for a post-2016 identity, the party has so far made little progress on this front.) Regardless, history has shown that the white rural electorate cannot be taken for granted, and Trump’s continued success in the countryside is far from certain.

Having Donald Trump in the White House has had a revolutionary effect on the economic outlook of Wisconsin’s most partisan voters, recent polling suggests.

In a flash, it has turned Republicans into rosy optimists and Democrats into dour pessimists, reversing the mood of voters in both parties.

You probably didn’t need a poll to tell you that.

But the polling also tells us something more stark and fundamental about the partisan prism through which many voters see the world.

Trump’s election did more than change the expectations of Republicans and Democrats about the economy’s future performance.

It altered their assessments of the economy’s actual performance.

When GOP voters in Wisconsin were asked last October whether the economy had gotten better or worse “over the past year,” they said “worse’’ — by a margin of 28 points.

But when they were asked the very same question last month, they said “better” — by a margin of 54 points.

That’s a net swing of 82 percentage points between late October 2016 and mid-March 2017.

What changed so radically in those four and a half months?

The economy didn’t. But the political landscape did.

Republican Trump replaced Democrat Barack Obama as president. With their own party now in power, Republicans overwhelmingly upgraded their evaluations of America’s economic performance.

“That’s a testament to the power of partisanship to rewrite our perceptions, even when the objective reality has hardly changed,” says the Marquette University Law School’s Charles Franklin, who conducted the polls cited above.

Something similar has happened in the nation as a whole. As the New York Times reported recently, Republicans and Democrats have done an about-face since the election in their economic outlook, with the partisan gap in national consumer sentiment bigger than ever before.

The Wisconsin polling is a striking illustration. Asked last month if, “looking ahead,” they expect the economy to get better, worse or stay the same over the next year, GOP voters chose “better” over “worse” by a margin of 80 points. Democratic voters chose “worse” over “better “ by a margin of 43 points.

That is the biggest partisan gap Marquette has ever recorded on this question in 42 polls dating back to the beginning of 2012. And it represents a huge shift since last fall for voters in both parties.

But the Wisconsin polling adds some other wrinkles to this story.

In its polls, Marquette poses a second question on the economy, asking voters to rate its performance over the past year.

Across more than five years of Wisconsin surveys, the results show some very distinctive patterns.

One is that the Republicans have shifted more dramatically in their views of the economy than Democrats, from overwhelmingly negative during much of the Obama presidency to overwhelmingly positive with Trump now in the White House. Democrats’ assessments of the economy darkened after Trump’s election, but the shifts in their views have been much more modest.

Two, the economic perceptions of both Republicans and Democrats have routinely seesawed with the state’s election cycles.

In presidential campaign seasons, Democratic voters have given the economy their best grades, Republicans their worst grades. Why?

One explanation is that the run-up to an election is when partisan voters are most likely to see the economy through a partisan lens. With Democrat Obama in the White House and his economic record a key campaign issue, his supporters see the economy in the best possible light, his opponents in the worst possible light.

In late October of 2012 — on the cusp of the presidential election — 59% of Wisconsin Democrats said the economy had gotten better over the previous 12 months. That is the highest figure recorded in 42 Marquette polls over five-plus years.

In the same survey, only 5% of GOP voters said the economy had gotten better. That is the lowest figure ever recorded by Marquette.

But just the opposite was true during the state's campaigns for governor, with Wisconsin Democrats giving the economy their worst grades, Republicans their best.

For example, Democratic views of the economy worsened during the recall election over Gov. Scott Walker in the summer of 2012, improved during the fall 2012 presidential campaign, worsened during the 2014 race for governor, and improved again during the 2016 presidential campaign.

SPECIAL REPORT: Democratic, Republican voters worlds apart in divided Wisconsin

GOP perceptions moved in the reverse direction.

Why would elections for governor produce a different pattern in Wisconsin than elections for president?

One fundamental difference is that in the 2012 and 2014 races for governor, the politician whose record in office was under scrutiny was a Republican — Walker. As a result, both parties adopted an entirely different economic message than the one they had during the most recent two presidential campaigns.

Walker aggressively touted the state’s economic performance under his leadership, while Democrats attacked it. The result? Republican voters grew more positive about the economy and Democrats grew more negative.

In fact, the best grades Republicans have ever given the economy in Marquette’s more than five years of polling were on the eve of the 2014 election, when Walker was seeking a second term. That was also when Wisconsin Democrats gave the economy their very worst grades in 42 Marquette polls.

In short, Democrats and especially Republicans in Wisconsin have changed their views of the economy far more than actual economic conditions have changed. And those views have shifted in concert with the election cycles.

The polling suggests that many partisan voters look to their preferred candidates for cues about how to view the economy, says Franklin, “which shows how much even economic reality is filtered through our subjective perceptions” by voters’ own partisan leanings."

In a rambling aside at a rally in Iowa on Wednesday night, Trump responded to criticism about his choices for top economic jobs, including billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for Commerce secretary and former Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn for chief economic advisor.

Trump, who bashed Goldman Sachs during the presidential campaign, received backlash for choosing wealthy Wall Street figures for top administration posts. Many of his nominees had complex financial holdings around the world, which created myriad potential conflicts.

Trump contended on Wednesday that wealthy people can better run the U.S. economy because they do not need money.

""I love all people, rich or poor. But in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person,"" Trump said. ""Does that make sense? Does that make sense? If you insist, I'll do it. But I like it better this way, right?""

The wealth of Trump's nominees created snags in the confirmation process as executive branch ethics officials aimed to make sure they complied with guidelines. While Trump's choices have divested from assets, some still have business holdings that leave the door open for potential conflicts.

The president also campaigned to bring back American manufacturing jobs—yet the budget calls for the elimination of programs such as the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP), which has proven highly successful at increasing productivity for small-and medium-sized manufacturers. For every one dollar of federal investment, MEP generates almost $18 dollars in sales growth for manufacturers. Similarly, the budget calls for eliminating the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program, which helped Tesla develop its electric car (the company now employs 17,000 workers).

In fact, many of the proposed program cuts would undercut the very goals on which President Trump campaigned. For example, while the president promised to reduce the trade deficit, the $5.8 billion cut from the National Institutes of Health’s budget surely won’t help decrease our $55.8 billion trade deficit in pharmaceutical products. NIH funds more than 300,000 researchers across the country and represents the nation’s feedstock of pharmaceutical research. The budget also eliminates the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the U.S. Trade Development Agency, which help U.S. companies access foreign markets.

The proposed cuts to the nation’s economic development and scientific infrastructure would erode critical programs that help regions succeed in the global economy. These range from technical assistance for small manufacturers, to incentives for regional firms to solve shared technical problems, to research funding for innovations that will define tomorrow’s global economy.

At the heart of President Trump’s budget are three major misconceptions about how economic competitiveness really works.

First, somewhat ironically for a Republican, the president thinks the bully pulpit and mandates from Washington can trump the economics of a global economy. The administration’s manufacturing strategy is to publicly shame companies that move abroad and develop trade barriers (tariff and non-tariff) to reduce U.S. firms’ exposure to the global economy. Yet, the graveyard of U.S. economic populism is filled with politicians who thought they could slow global competition with a megaphone.

The only sure way for U.S. manufacturers to survive is to become more competitive—creating better products for cheaper—than their global rivals. Initiatives like the Economic Development Administration have helped regional economies become more competitive by providing matching grants in targeted industry clusters where these regions have an international edge. Despite this, the president’s budget calls for the elimination of EDA.

The Trump method of reshoring manufacturing jobs is also far more expensive than building the competitiveness of the sector. When the president negotiated Carrier away from leaving Indiana for Mexico, it saved 800 jobs at the cost of $2 million per job. In contrast, analysis of MEP shows that the program creates one job in the manufacturing sector for roughly $1,900. This makes sense. Trying to overpower global economic forces has always been a tall (and expensive) order. Hardly the stuff of a budget conservative.

The second problem is that his administration believes that less government, limited regulation, and a low statutory corporate tax rate is sufficient to grow a globally competitive economy. This philosophy fundamentally misunderstands how countries compete in the modern economy: What really differentiates successful high-value economies is their ability to innovate. In the technologies that define U.S. competitiveness—robotics, data analytics, drug development, energy storage—the interplay between public sector research and development and private sector innovation is essential. For example, 80 percent of the most transformative new drugs over the last 25 years have resulted from collaboration between industry and universities. NIH funds an astounding 45 percent of all health care research (from all funding sources) in U.S. universities. Thus, the proposed funding cuts would decimate the nation’s ability to compete in new drug discoveries. Similarly, the cuts to the Department of Energy’s Office of Science would hamstring the country’s ability to lead the world in new generation energy products.

Finally, the president refuses to learn from our national competitors—like an NCAA basketball coach who doesn’t look at rival’s tapes leading into March Madness. The programs the president plans on cutting have analogues in most advanced countries. Germany’s Fraunhofer Institutes, Australia’s Enterprise Connect, Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Program, Japan’s Kohsetsushi Centers, and the U.K.’s Manufacturing Advisory Service all offer similar programming to the MEP and maintain healthy support across the political spectrum because they make these countries stronger. Instead of cutting programs that our rivals consider successful, we should put them on steroids.

The proposal to eliminate the NIH’s Fogarty International Center is a perfect example of the administration’s anti-competitive, insular nature. Fogarty fosters partnerships with health researchers and institutions abroad in order to improve scientific discovery at home. If we as a country aren’t engaged in learning from the successes of other countries, we will fail to remain competitive.

Trump’s budget, like much of his rhetoric, is fundamentally backward-looking. It attempts to support a 21st century economy with 20th century tools and ideas."

On Friday, he got a taste of just how far he has to go. The country's gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic growth, grew by a paltry 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017, slower than the quarter before it and far from what Trump said he would and could deliver for the American people. During the campaign, he cited figures as high as 6 percent.

Now, that anemic quarter isn't Trump's fault — there's little if anything any president can do in his opening months that would have an instant effect on GDP growth — and it's not even as bad as it sounds.

Despite the disappointing figures in Friday's report, experts believe the economy is doing reasonably well. Official estimates of economic activity in the first quarter often give the impression of a weak economy, in part because of the weather. A winter storm can halt a construction project, or keep shoppers off the street. By contrast, unusually warm weather can discourage consumers from spending on wintry items.

The bad news for Trump is that while the economy may be sound, it's not roaring, and a host of longer-term factors — which Trump didn't cause but also can't fix — mean it's unlikely to hit rocket growth any time soon.

One factor is the age of the labor force. Although more Americans have gone back to work since the financial crisis eight years ago, the number of workers who are available has been declining as baby boomers retire. That trend limits how much the economy can produce.

Trump's allies say he can restore the economy to its level under President Ronald Reagan. After an initial recession during his administration, GDP skyrocketed 7.3 percent in 1984, and continued to expand rapidly for the rest of his term.

Yet Reagan had advantages that Trump will not. When Reagan was in office, the labor force was expanding rapidly as women went to work in the formal sector. Meanwhile, the economy was on the verge of a technological boom.

“The evidence shows clearly that no feasible tax reform in this country will raise economic growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis,” said Douglas Elmendorf, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, in a recent interview with The Washington Post.

Trump's task is complicated by the Federal Reserve, which after nearly a decade of attempting to stimulate the economy, is now trying to make sure it doesn't run too hot. At their meeting last month, Fed officials said the economy was performing according to expectations and that they planned additional hikes in interest rates if the current trend continued. Investors are expecting another increase in June.

And while every president hopes for a roaring economy, under the tax outline Trump put out this week, he's officially betting the country's finances on it.

The White House is counting on economic growth to be able to cut taxes without adding to the national debt.

Trump aims to reduce taxes sharply, especially on businesses, but his advisers say that there is no need to bring down government spending at the same time. Instead, they argue, the cuts will stimulate rapid economic growth, allowing the government to go on collecting the same amount of money in taxes despite reduced rates.

If that growth does not materialize, then the government will have to borrow more to make up for the forgone revenue. And sooner or later, that bill comes due."

First, he’s betting on a domestic energy policy that strongly favors increased production of fossil fuels. “I don’t want anything to get in our way,” he declared.

Second, he’s betting—at least so he said in his speech on Thursday afternoon in the White House Rose Garden—that the rest of the world will come back to the bargaining table for a new deal. (“If we can’t, that’s fine,” he shrugged.)

Either bet could go wrong. Missed opportunities in the emerging green economy could end up outweighing any short-term gains from fossil fuels. Today’s fossil fuels could even end up as stranded assets if the rest of the world does hold firm and weans itself off them.

“The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord,” Trump proclaimed in an unapologetic speech that was a ringing endorsement of the most radical climate naysayers among his supporters. “As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.”

The biggest risk of all, though, is that backsliding by the United States could quickly lock in a prolonged and dangerous warming. That would be especially likely if other nations follow Trump out of the global pact.

“This is a huge gamble,” said Nathaniel Keohane, vice president of global climate programming at the Environmental Defense Fund. “We know the longer we wait to act, the more expensive it will be and the more drastic measures we’ll have to take to avert the worst impacts of climate change. So walking backwards on climate just when the rest of the world has committed to move forward is a huge gamble.”

Advocates of the Paris Agreement were left hoping that market forces, popular opinion, global actions, and efforts by U.S. cities, states and corporations will all contribute enough to offset the loss of momentum as the federal government abandons the field.

White House officials, in calls and documents briefing Congressional staff, lobbyists and journalists, said that the formal process of leaving the agreement would take up to four years. But in the meantime, Trump said, the United States would not be bound by any of the treaty’s obligations. In particular, he said, the U.S. would not attempt to adhere to its Paris pledge, known as a “nationally determined contribution” because it is voluntary.

Nor would it give any more money to the international Green Climate Fund, designed to help poor countries cut their emissions and adapt to climate changes. Trump derided the fund—“nice name,” he said sarcastically—as a redistribution of wealth that America could ill afford. White House talking points obtained by Politico called it a “slush fund.”

The tone of his remarks was at times defiant, at times mocking of the pact and its supporters. The dominant chord was resentful, like a dirge for the most-picked-upon nation on the planet, not the most powerful.

It played to his coal-country base, as when he talked of his love for coal miners, or pledged to put Pittsburgh before Paris. And it seemed to little matter that Pittsburgh, a city that has worked hard to develop a reputation as a technology hub in the past decade, has less than 1 percent of its workers employed in the mining sector and only 7 percent in manufacturing. In fact, the mayor of Pittsburgh promptly came out in favor of the Paris Agreement on Twitter.

Above all, Trump said, he was simply fulfilling a campaign promise.

He spoke to a handpicked audience of supporters from government, industry and climate-denial think tanks, even as noisy protesters began to assemble in the park on the other side of the White House.

His decision came after weeks of internal tussling among his advisers, but it has been clear for a long time that Trump had no intention of fulfilling the Paris promises—he has embarked on a comprehensive repudiation of practically every federal policy aimed at reducing emissions, whether under the Clean Power Plan for electric utilities or countless other initiatives of the Obama administration.

The problem isn’t so much that Trump’s unilateral action will abruptly derail global progress toward rapidly eliminating carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, the central goal of Paris. As the prominent consulting firm Wood Mackenzie told Carbon Brief, it is “unlikely to materially alter the prospects for fossil fuel demand growth,” since renewables, energy efficiency and other decarbonization trends are largely driven by market forces.

Rather, a retreat by the U.S. could choke off the acceleration of the shift to cleaner fuels that the Paris negotiators built into the agreement, which sends powerful signals to the private sector. It’s urgent that this transformation occur quickly, as the world is just a few years from busting the carbon emissions budget for a safe climate—a limit based neither on politics nor willpower, but on science.

Without higher ambition, according to the United Nations’ latest annual “gap report,” the world is “on track for global warming of up to 3.4 degrees Celsius. Current commitments will reduce emissions by no more than a third of the levels required.”

Just this week, the federal climate agency NOAA issued its annual report on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, data that has been showing an alarming acceleration of the crisis.

In his speech, Trump asserted incorrectly that the amount of warming the treaty would prevent was “a tiny, tiny amount,” and he made no concession to the science that stands behind its goals or the global consensus supporting climate action.

According to an analysis by Climate Interactive, a nonprofit that runs climate simulations, the pledge the U.S. made at Paris was big enough to account for more than one-fifth of all the emissions expected to be avoided under the treaty commitments.

For the United States to abandon its pledge means the world could warm an additional 0.3 degrees Celsius by the century’s end, the report found in a worst-case scenario.

According to an analysis released earlier this year, the laundry list of anti-climate and pro-drilling initiatives announced by the Trump administration by mid-March had already put effectively out of reach the U.S. pledge at Paris—a planned reduction of emissions by about 28 percent by 2020, from the levels of 2005.

Historically, the U.S. is the biggest greenhouse polluter of all. It surely would be challenging for the rest of the world to compensate for American backsliding. But it’s not entirely impossible.

Climate Action Tracker, a non-profit that specializes in modeling, forecast last month that China, the world’s top emitter, and India, the third-highest emitter of climate pollution, are on track to meet their climate pledges a few years ahead of schedule, and that this alone might be enough to offset the abdication of the United States.

European and Chinese diplomats, like other world leaders at the Group of Seven and at the UN, have spoken forcefully in favor of preserving the Paris Agreement. Today, at the start of a Sino-Euro summit, their draft communique pledged intensified action by China and the European Union no matter what Trump did. It called the Paris pact a “historic achievement” and “irreversible.”

A group representing large cities around the world has issued a new report saying that the long-term goals of Paris are still reachable if cities act in the next four years to reach a peak in greenhouse gas pollution and then cut average per-capita emissions nearly in half in the following ten years. But the report cautioned that this vision would cost $1 trillion in investments by 2050, including $375 billion to jump-start progress in the next four years, after which it would be too late.

“If all cities of 100,000 people or more act on the recommendations in the report, the world will achieve 40% of the emissions reductions necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change,” said the global group, known as C40 Cities. Dozens of U.S. mayors, organized by the Sierra Club, have promised to shift to renewable electricity in the coming decades.

In a statement, former President Barack Obama said, “The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership,” he said, “I’m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way.”

But because the window on climate action is closing so fast, whether the world as a whole meets its goals may ultimately hinge on what the U.S. does, said Bill Hare, one of the leaders of Climate Action Tracker.

“What would the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement mean for the ability to keep temperatures well below 2 degrees? The answer depends on how long the U.S. is out of the game,” he said.

Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and policitcal beliefs. America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal. As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.

Alex Gorsky Johnson & Johnson CEO Aug. 16, 2017 Gorsky: Johnson & Johnson has a responsibility to remain engaged as important policy decisions are made. That hasn't changed. The President’s most recent statements equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred is unacceptable and has changed our decision to participate in the White House Manufacturing Advisory Council.

The administration has other councils focused on other policy areas, such as developing a competitive income tax code and streamlining burdensome regulation.UTC strongly supports the goals of each of these advisory committees as a way of ensuring and enhancing America’s growth in the decades to come. However, as events of the last week have unfolded here in the U.S., it is clear that we need to collectively stand together and denounce the politics of hate, intolerance and racism. The values that are the cornerstone of our culture: tolerance, diversity, empathy and trust, must be reaffirmed by our actions every day. Accordingly, I have tendered my resignation from the Council effective today.

I joined the President’s Committee on Manufacturing because engagement with government on economic policy is very important for GE, our employees, and partners. As a company that exports over $20 billion of American made goods to the world, I believe we are best served when we constructively engage with leaders in the United States and around the world. The Committee I joined had the intention to foster policies that promote American manufacturing and growth.

I plan to continue to collaborate with other leaders from diverse industries, who represent a variety of perspectives and beliefs, to help shape strategies and develop policies that foster a more vibrant economy and more jobs in the U.S. We find the events of this past weekend in Charlottesville to be incredibly troubling. There is simply no place in our society for racism of any kind, white supremacy, or Neo-Nazism.

After careful consideration, I believe the initiative is no longer an effective vehicle for 3M to advance these goals. As a result, today I am resigning from the Manufacturing Advisory Council.

The election of Donald J. Trump to the US Presidency on November 8, 2016 was unexpected. Despite being the Republican party’s nominee, Trump campaigned as a political outsider on a platform of eclectic policy ideas. And without prior governing experience, there is little historical record from which to predict his administration’s economic policymaking priorities.

Download the eBook: Economics and Policy in the Age of Trump

Trump’s Presidency has generated considerable uncertainty for various areas of US economic policy. The tenor of his Inaugural Address suggests a very apocalyptic view of the state of the U.S. economy as well as America’s place in the world

“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now… For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry…One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.” (Donald J. Trump, The Inaugural Address, January 20, 2017)

Yet, Republican Congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate imply a political opportunity for Trump to overhaul existing laws and institutions. Furthermore, a US President can take many actions unilaterally – without the need to work with Congress – to also effectuate economic policy change. Indeed, the resulting US court challenges to some of Trump’s Executive Orders signal his administration’s willingness to test historical limits on Presidential authority.

This collection of essays by leading economists highlights many of the most pressing domestic and international economic policy issues on the Trump docket.

Policy Lessons

To date, the Trump administration is not formulating its economic policies based on economic evidence, research, or much input from professional economists.

In several areas, the Trump administration is threatening the underlying institutions that implement successful policy, putting the systems themselves at risk.

Many of the Trump administration’s proposed policies are expected to result in economic outcomes that run into direct conflict with the Administration’s stated policy goals.

Domestic Policy Reform I: Health, anti-poverty, labour, education, immigration and environment

A first set of essays examines Trump’s approach to the US domestic economy and key areas of policy affecting health, individuals and families, education, labour markets, and the environment.

Health care and health insurance were a first political priority for President Trump and the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives. The result has been efforts to repeal, or repeal and replace, the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as ‘Obamacare.’ Second, Trump’s draft 2018 budget also called for major cuts to the US social safety net, with the potential to adversely impact lifetime outcomes for at-risk youth, rising US income inequality, and the fabled ‘American Dream.’ On education, a third issue is Trump’s potential to roll back the 2014 gainful employment (GE) regulations on the increasingly important and controversial “for profit” college sector. Fourth is the unintended consequences – running counter to the administration’s own trade policy goals – of Trump’s proposed changes to the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) environmental regulations.

The 2016 Presidential campaign also brought into sharp political relief other misunderstood areas of the US economy, including the labor market. One was manufacturing job loss, and the need for evidence to reject the political argument that it was mainly increased international trade – especially imports from China and Mexico – to blame for the negative outcomes affecting a segment of US workers. A second is the role of immigration in the United States. Trump’s first 100 days featured a slew of Executive Orders banning travellers and immigrants from certain majority-Muslim countries, enhanced deportations and construction of a border wall with Mexico, and limiting access to H1-B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers.

Domestic Policy Reform II: Tax, central banking, financial regulation, and the macroeconomy

A second set of essays examines Trump’s potential impact on the domestic economy through tax reform and changes to monetary policymaking, financial regulatory reform, and US macroeconomic performance.

Like health care, US tax reform has been another early item on the Trump administration’s agenda; the last major overhaul of the US tax code took place in 1986. Trump has proposed mainly tax cuts, whereas the House Republican leadership has put forward a major reform to the US business tax system: replacement of the current corporate income tax with a destination-based, cash flow tax that would include a highly controversial (and little understand) border tax adjustment.

Trump’s approach to three important areas of macroeconomic policy also stand out. The first concerns threats to the political independence to the Federal Reserve, the United States’ central bank. Second is the intent of the Trump administration to pursue financial deregulation, and the potential for significant reform to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Third is the Administration’s general approach to the macroeconomy, and suggestions that the United States is likely to achieve sustained long-run annual growth of as high as 6 percent.

International Policy Reform: US trade policy and trade agreements

The third set of essays examines President Trump’s potentially radical reshaping of US trade policy. One particularly striking line from his Inaugural Address – “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength” – indicates that an influential wing of his administration finds trade barriers appealing and perceives them as likely to benefit the U.S. economy.[1]

The Trump administration has used its first 100 days in office to signal many potential changes to US trade policy and its willingness to abide by trade agreements. Table 1 presents a list. Nevertheless, the only definitive policy change taken was in the first week, when the administration withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Perhaps the other items are only the tough talk of a negotiator and may not result in policies that damage the US economy. Many of the Executive Orders, for example, are intentions to study the source of a “problem” the Administration perceives face the US economy.[2]

Table 1. The Trump Administration’s First ‘100 Days of Trade Policy’

Yet other items in Table 1 do have worrisome implications, and the chapters in this volume takes up many of those concerns. What does Trump’s TPP withdrawal mean for the US strategy to engage China with its market-oriented reforms and integration in the global system? [3] What are the potential implications of a Trump administration renegotiation of NAFTA? [4] Is this ‘100 day’ list – especially of trade enforcement cases on products like steel and lumber – just the tip of the iceberg on more sweeping change to US policy? [5],[6] Why has the United States championed certain WTO principles in trade negotiations, including nondiscriminatory treatment, through the ‘most-favoured-nation’ (MFN) rule, and ‘reciprocity’, and what are the implications of giving that up? [7] Finally, what is the future of US-Europe trade relations, i.e., a key linchpin behind the global trading system for the last 70 years?

Concluding remarks

The flurry of activity during the Trump administration’s first ‘100 days’ in office confirms a nontraditional approach to governing, a still largely unknown short- and long-term strategy, and unclear economic policy priorities. Some of the policies being subjected to potential reform – including health care, taxes, and financial sector regulation – may have been likely to arise, independent of the individual sitting in the Oval Office. But others – such as central bank independence, more radical steps on immigration, and reversing the US’s decades-long approach to trade policy and commitment to international cooperation – are much more extreme, far-reaching, and potentially disruptive.

On Trump’s economic policies, the broad consensus across this volume’s authors is one of watchful wariness and considerable concern. Many of the Trump administration’s proposed economic policy changes have the potential for significant short- and long-run disruption to the US and global economy.

Originally from Acapulco, Mexico, he now works for a construction company and regularly sends remittances for food and other necessities to his family back home. “This income is crucial for them. I want to help however I can,” Valderrama says. He is not the only one.

Every month, U.S. residents like Valderrama send $2 billion across the border to their families in Mexico. More than 6 million Mexicans, or about 7 percent of the adult population, benefit from such remittances, which collectively account for nearly 3 percent of the country’s economy.

But that steady stream of cross-border cash could soon be in jeopardy. As part of his plan to make Mexico pay for a border wall, Donald Trump has said he will demand the country “make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion” if it wants to protect the flow of remittances. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has said repeatedly that the country won’t pay for the wall, meaning that if Trump follows through on his threats, millions of Mexican families could soon lose out on a vital source of income. (On Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order pushing forward with the wall; on Thursday, Peña Nieto said he was canceling a planned meeting with Trump in Washington.)

“There is fear among Mexican and Central American immigrants in the U.S.,” said Jesús Alejandro Cervantes González, coordinator of the Remittances Forum of Latin America and the Caribbean. In the face of possible restrictions, remittances to Mexico reached a historic peak in 2016. In November alone, remittances to Mexico grew by 24.7 percent compared with the same month a year earlier.

Remittances, however, are just the beginning of the risk Trump’s presidency could pose to the Mexican economy. If he follows through on his proposed policies, Trump could change the calculus for doing business in Mexico, and thus endanger the economic prospects of the whole country.

Among his proposed policies, Trump has threatened to renegotiate or completely withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and impose a 35 percent tax on businesses that ship goods to the U.S. after relocating out of the country. Either policy could be devastating for the Mexican economy.

“If Trump implements all the policies he’s been talking about, the next year to year and a half could be very complicated for Mexico,” said Jesús Peña Gonzalez, an economist and director of a manufacturing firm in Monterrey, Mexico.

Mexico’s economy has long depended on trade with the U.S., and those ties have only deepened since 1994, when the North American Free Trade Agreement lowered trade barriers between the two nations. Mexican exports more than quadrupled since NAFTA went into effect; they accounted for 37.5 percent of Mexico’s gross domestic product in 2015 (they make up just 12.3 percent of the U.S. economy), and more than 80 percent of those exports go to the U.S. Mexico is now the world’s fourth-largest car exporter, and the automobile industry directly employs almost 900,000 workers across the country.

Free trade — along with relatively skilled but cheap labor — has also drawn businesses and their investment dollars into the country. For the past two decades, Mexico has been Latin America’s second-largest recipient, after Brazil, of what economists call foreign direct investment — foreign companies building factories, buying businesses or investing in Mexican companies. In 2015 alone, Mexico received a total of $32 billion dollars in FDI, $17 billion of it from the United States.

What can look to Mexico like investment, however, can look to Americans like outsourcing — and Trump has painted a bright target on the backs of companies that send jobs to Mexico. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked Carrier, an Indiana air-conditioning manufacturer that had announced plans to shift production to Monterrey, Mexico. Shortly after the election, Trump and Carrier announced they had reached a deal, keeping close to 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis (the exact number of jobs saved has been questioned).

Weeks later, Ford announced it was canceling plans for a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosí, and would instead invest $700 million in a facility in Michigan. The announcement took place the same day Trump threatened General Motors to move production of the Chevy Cruze to the U.S. or face a big border tax. Ford CEO Mark Fields has said the prospects of a “positive business environment under President-elect Trump, particularly manufacturing,” played a role in this decision.

Economists in Mexico see the move as part of a larger threat to the Mexican economy. “Beyond the supposed tariffs or any of his proposed anti-Mexico policies, Mexico is going to suffer the most from the anti-Mexico sentiment that Mr. Trump is promoting among American society and businesses,” said Manuel Molano, general adjunct director at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a think tank. “I’m really concerned that with his art of persuasion, Trump will convince more individuals and companies to do less business with Mexico.”

Economists on both sides of the border see Trump’s threats as shortsighted. Two decades of free trade have left the Mexican, American and Canadian economies deeply entwined. Car parts made in Michigan and Ontario end up on assembly lines in Monterrey, where factories churn out cars destined for drivers across the continent. That interconnectedness has cost jobs for some workers in Detroit and other manufacturing hubs, but it has created jobs elsewhere, and brought down prices for consumers.

“NAFTA has improved the competitiveness of businesses, and it has benefited consumers in the three countries through access to better productivity and lower prices,” said Guillermo Rosales Zárate, general director at the Mexican Association of Automobile Distributors. “We can’t talk about a Mexican, American or Canadian car anymore — it’s a NAFTA car.”

While Trump’s proposed policies have yet to be realized, markets have already reacted to the uncertainty about Mexico’s economic future. Banamex, the Mexican unit of Citibank, has cut its projections for total foreign direct investment in Mexico for 2017 from $35.8 billion dollars to $25 billion. In turn, private sector specialists surveyed by the Bank of Mexico in December estimated GDP growth for 2017 at 1.6 percent — cutting the estimate they had made at the beginning of 2016 (3.18 percent) almost in half.

Currency traders are likewise signaling uncertainty about the future of the Mexican economy. The Mexican peso tumbled about 14.1 percent since Trump won the Republican nomination last July. The currency decreased by 7.7 percent on the day after the election, and hit a record low at $21.91 pesos to the U.S. dollar following Trump’s press conference on Jan. 11, when he again threatened retributions against companies that move to Mexico. (A falling peso generally indicates currency traders expect less investment and slower economic growth.)

The rapid depreciation of the peso could help Mexican exports by making the country’s products cheaper for foreign customers. But it carries its own economic risks, including inflation, which has already started rising. The Bank of Mexico expects an inflation rate of 4.13 percent for 2017 — the highest annual average since 2008. Some economists, among them Molano, estimate it could be more than double that.

The uncertainty of Trump’s policies not only impact foreign investors but also local ones. Caution seems to be the prevailing strategy among Mexican businesses — which could itself harm the economy, as companies and individuals pull back on spending.

“I’m worried about the potential for Mexico to go into a recession,” Peña said. “The expectations are very volatile, so I’ve stopped investing. There’s this negative sentiment among business owners to stand by and expect the worst.”"

The result could be a topsy-turvy country where an activist government -- the traditional hallmark of Democrats -- is trying to impose conservative goals while also forcing Republicans to swallow things like higher federal spending and budget deficits.

In addition, it’s an America where the customary, if sometimes dysfunctional, norms no longer apply. These include free trade, corporate liberty to send jobs where the cost is lowest and a tax code laden with deductions.

“This is a case of government on your back, micromanaging,” said economist Dennis Hoffman, a professor at Arizona State University who has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in national contests. “The government will tell you who you can hire and who you can source your products from.”

With his party holding majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump likely will get much of what he wants, in some form. At the congressional Republicans’ gathering in Philadelphia on Thursday, the president’s ideas met with approval and applause.

Even his call for a $1 trillion program to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure seems to be gaining traction among Republican budget hawks. This comes despite past GOP opposition to such a plan pushed by President Barack Obama -- which Republicans derided as a budget-busting boondoggle.

On trade, jobs and taxes, his first week showed Mr. Trump is keeping his word from the election campaign. While his tough prescriptions could bring better deals for U.S. consumers and taxpayers, they carry large potential downsides.

With trade, the new president’s goal is to reverse the nation’s deficit with the rest of the globe. Now, America imports more goods and services than it exports. His method is as tough as it is straightforward: Renegotiate trade treaties and, failing that, impose high tariffs on imports. Such a confrontational course risks higher prices for U.S. consumers and a disruption of global trade that could harm the U.S. economy.

By the same token, his campaign to increase American job growth could prove enormously costly in terms of the federal deficit and the national debt.

The same trade-off exists for his plan to slash both corporate and personal tax rates: More money would be in pockets for spending, and Washington would be deeper in red ink.

Here’s how Mr. Trump may alter the American economic status quo:

Trade. The president’s fight may be with the world, but he has targeted two key offenders to cross swords with, Mexico and China. He has the power to impose tariffs on both, although the risk is that a mutually ruinous trade war would erupt and imports would be costlier for American consumers.

In his inaugural address, he lambasted what he sees as one-sided trade that harms U.S. workers. “The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and distributed around the world,” he said.

Last week, Mr. Trump ordered the construction of a massive wall along the U.S. Southern border border, a notion that was a staple of his campaign oratory, and his press secretary floated the idea of a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico. The president followed that by picking a Twitter fight with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto that led to a cancellation of their planned meeting.

No doubt about it: Mexico sells the U.S. more than it buys from the U.S., to the tune of $61 billion. When the two nations (along with Canada) enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, the U.S. has a $1.7 billion surplus with its Southern neighbor. Now Mr. Trump wants to renegotiate the pact, something the Mexicans are not eager to do.

The president has stuck to his campaign trail pledge that he would make Mexico pay for his proposed wall, which is designed to keep its citizens from illegally entering the U.S. However, Mexican politicians and its public don’t want to spend a single peso on such a venture. So lately, Mr. Trump is saying the U.S. will pay to build it and get Mexico to pay up in other ways -- perhaps by using tariff proceeds.

The wall won’t be cheap: up to $25 billion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that amounts to $120 per U.S. household.

Meanwhile, China has long enjoyed a huge trade surplus with the U.S., which has grown from around $84 billion in 2000 to $337 billion in 2015. That’s why Mr. Trump has proposed slapping a tariff on Chinese imports of as much as 45 percent, up from the current 3 percent.

Amid all this, the president made what appears to be a contradictory move: He withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The TPP aimed to reduce trade barriers with seven nations on the other side of the Pacific: Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Brunei and New Zealand.

Absent from the pact was China, and many viewed the TPP as a means of containing Beijing’s regional regional economic influence. With the TPP all but dead, China is pursuing its own Asia-Pacific trade agreement, excluding the U.S. from the table. But Mr. Trump is convinced -- as was his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton -- that the TPP wouldn’t protect American jobs.

Jobs. Since overseas production often is cheaper than in the U.S., many domestic multinationals have an incentive to ship jobs elsewhere. One way Mr. Trump is attacking this situation is by proposing to impose tariffs on U.S. companies that build things in other places, then sell them in the U.S. The other way is to publicly shame employers that send jobs offshore.

Aside from cheaper labor overseas, the motive to ship the jobs out of America is to get a lower tax bill. Washington taxes them far more -- a maximum 35 percent, although with deductions, it’s lower -- than many foreign governments do.

Right now, the U.S. taxes net income for American corporations, regardless of where in the world it is earned. This encourages them to shift production offshore and to keep their profits overseas. For that reason, Mr. Trump wants to lower the U.S. corporate rate.

House Republicans, however, are floating a remedy called a “border adjustment,” which is meant to boost exports and push down imports. The method sounds simple enough: Imports are taxed and exports aren’t.

But then it gets complex. Pantheon Economics’ chief economist Ian Shepherson noted that American businesspeople traveling overseas would be taxed on their expenses. At the same time, he asked, “And how would foreign tourists receive a credit for their spending in, say, U.S. restaurants?” And some import-dependent American companies, like apparel retailers, would be harmed.

As a consequence, Mr. Trump initially rejected the border-adjustment concept as “too complicated.” Then on Thursday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said it was part of a “buffet” of options the White House would consider. Where the president and Capitol Hill end up remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers appear eager to do something.

Beyond that, Mr. Trump’s drive to chastise companies that push production overseas has born fruit -- in that several he has criticized have knuckled under. The question is whether one-off attacks, often launched by Mr. Trump on Twitter, will be effective in a vast $19 trillion economy, which would entail zeroing in on hundreds of corporate behemoths.

Large enterprises, which are the ones shipping the jobs out, employ around 60 million American workers, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Economist Peter Morici, a University of Maryland professor, speaking on National Public Radio, cast doubt on the effectiveness of Mr. Trump’s targeting these companies. “Let’s lean on General Motors. Let’s lean on Carrier. Let’s lean on United Technologies,” he said. “You know, all the deals in the world are not going to give you the kind of turnaround and jobs growth that he needs. For example, 100,000 more jobs a month would mean a hundred deals a month.”

Indeed, the math is daunting. Take Mr. Trump’s announcement Wednesday that Sprint (S) would be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the U.S. over the next 15 months. The U.S. economy in 2016, though, created 6,000 jobs per day.

Taxes. For personal income taxes, Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, both want to lower tax rates and the number of tax brackets, although they differ on some details. The president would cap deductions at $200,000 for a couple. Ryan would end itemized deductions except for charity and mortgage interest.

To be sure, Mr. Trump’s plan, as unveiled during the campaign, would put more money in everyone’s pocket, with wealthier taxpayers benefiting the most. An analysis by the Tax Foundation think tank found that those in the top 1 percent of income would gain as much as 16 percent, and those in the 40 percent-60 percent segment would get only 1.3 percent more. Mr. Trump has disputed that analysis.

In terms of corporate taxes, the president wants to lower the top rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent, and Speaker Ryan opts for 20 percent, which he believes would be more fiscally prudent. They also both want to engineer a repatriation of some $2 trillion in U.S multinationals’ profits now stashed oversees, free of the IRS.

Their hope is that the money would flow to building new plants and equipment and to hiring more Americans. The trap here is that the funds might instead end up going to stockholders in the form of higher dividends and share buybacks. That would be an economic stimulus, certainly, yet wouldn’t juice businesses and jobs directly.

The last time a repatriation happened, in 2004, the government charged a special low tax rate of 5.25 percent and, sure enough, the money corporations brought home went mainly to investors.

The one thing that a lower corporate rate would accomplish, said John Maloney, chairman of New York-based M&R Capital Management, is to boost smaller businesses -- which usually aren’t public companies with shareholders and have no overseas operations.

“Small companies are the ones that create most of the jobs,” Maloney said. And they tend to pay higher rates than large corporations, who, thanks to clever uses of deductions and the like, may pay an effective federal tax rate as low as 10 percent. “The small and midsize businesses don’t have the accounting firepower” from expensive law and accounting firms that the big corporations do, he said.

None of this comes cheap. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that enactment of Mr. Trump’s plans would add $5.3 trillion to the national debt, pushing it to 105 percent of GDP from 77 percent now. The president’s team has disagreed with that conclusion, saying the economic bonanza from the president’s program would lead to a torrent of new tax revenue.

Whichever is right, the momentum for now seems to be with the Oval Office’s new occupant. And America’s reality may reflect his economic vision, sooner or later."

USA TODAY

Can President Trump give the aging U.S. recovery a B-12 shot?

Trump has promised 3% to 4% economic growth over the long run, compared with the modest 2% average throughout the eight-year-old recovery.

But economists think he will be hard-pressed to deliver on his pledge because of some inherent shackles on the economy. They include a labor market that’s already at full employment, an aging population and sluggish business productivity. The president also faces significant hurdles pushing his economic blueprint through a deficit-wary Congress. If he does, that likely would blow up the deficit — the gap between federal income and expenses — creating its own drag on the economy.

“There's no way to connect the dots between his policies and that level of growth,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.

Don't grade Trump yet. The government reported last week that the economy grew at an anemic 0.7% pace in the first three months of the year, but Trump took office about a third of the way through the period and his policies have yet to be implemented.

Long term, there are two ways to lift economic growth: add workers at a faster clip or increase each worker's output, or productivity.

The challenge for Trump in moving the needle on hiring is this: The current 4.5% unemployment rate means there are relatively few jobless Americans actively looking for work. As a result, monthly payroll growth this year is expected to slow to an average of 160,000, from 180,000 last year and 226,000 in 2015. The labor force, which includes people who are working and those who are looking for jobs, is also expanding more slowly because an average 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring each day, says Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist of Northern Trust. Immigrants, he says, could pick up the slack but Trump has vowed to restrict immigration.

Boosting workers' output significantly will also be a tall order. Growth in productivity has been feeble since 2011.. Businesses have been hesitant to invest in new technology that could raise each worker’s output, partly because demand from customers has been tepid. Also, many have seen little reason to buy machines to replace workers when slow wage growth has made those workers relatively inexpensive.

Fewer people have moved around the country to find jobs that better tap their skills since many owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth following the housing crash. And the recession discouraged risk-taking startups, which tend to be more productive than established companies.

Economy grows a feeble 0.7% in Q1

How Trump's tax plan would affect households

Small business optimism is soaring

Now that wages are rising more rapidly, fewer homeowners are underwater and business confidence is booming, Zandi expects productivity growth to accelerate somewhat. But at best, he says, that likely will simply offset the slowdown in employment gains, keeping economic growth treading water at just above 2%.

Trump's tax plan, unveiled last week, would cut the corporate rate to 15% from 35% and slash individual taxes, spurring more business and household spending, Zandi says. But with his proposal likely to add trillions of dollars to the national debt, Zandi expects a compromise with Congress that would lower the corporate rate more modestly, to 28%.

Similarly, he expects Trump’s vision of spending $1 trillion over a decade to upgrade the nation’s crumbling roads, bridges and waterways to be whittled down to $200 billion over four years.

In the end, Zandi estimates such a compromise stimulus package would push economic growth to 2.7% in 2018 from a baseline of 2.3%. But increasing the deficit, he says, would quickly push up interest rates, discouraging borrowing and reducing economic growth enough in subsequent years to offset the short-term gain. The Federal Reserve, he says, also would raise rates to temper the faster inflation Trump’s plan would spark, further nudging up borrowing costs and curtailing economic activity.

The tax and spending proposals “won’t be game changers,” Zandi says.

Trump administration officials have said the plan would pay for itself because the faster economic growth will sharply increase federal tax revenue. Many economists are skeptical.

But Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist of Deutsche Bank, says the increased consumer and business demand triggered by lower taxes would further spur companies to ramp up capital spending, lifting productivity and economic growth more than many analysts anticipate. More productive companies, in turn, would increase wages more dramatically, which would further goose spending. LaVorgna believes his colleagues underestimate the self-reinforcing positive effects of Trump’s agenda.

“If we have the right policies, I see no reason why we can’t get to 3% growth,” he says. Yet even he believes that a more muscular economy is likely to be short-lived unless Trump’s aggressive plan sails through Congress with few changes.

If it does, however, that could mean a bigger deficit and the economic hazards that come with it."

— -- President Trump has long accused China of perpetrating one of the “greatest thefts in the history of the world"" when it comes to trade with the U.S. and promised he would have his Treasury secretary label China a currency manipulator.

But while visiting China this week, Trump took a softer line and said the country was not responsible for trade imbalances with the U.S.

“I don’t blame China,” Trump said Thursday in Beijing. “After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country to the benefit of its citizens?”

Instead, Trump pointed the finger at his predecessors for “allowing this out-of-control trade deficit to take place and to grow.”

Trump’s visit follows a presidential campaign in which he criticized China's business practices and how it handles trade with the United States. He has made China the target of more than 200 of his tweets over the years.

One the flip side, however, Trump said at a 2016 campaign rally that “I love China” and that he has made lots of money doing business with the country.

Here are some of the unconventional slights Trump has either said, written or tweeted about China in the past:

The Trump administration has said proposals such as tax reform and infrastructure spending could grow the U.S. economy at 3 percent or more.

In the first quarter, the U.S. economy posted its slowest pace of growth in three years at less than 1 percent. Growth is expected to pick up slightly in coming quarters because of Trump's policies, according to Wall Street economists.

— President Trump, remarks on infrastructure, Aug. 15, 2017 “I think if we continue to create jobs like I’ve done — over 1 million since I’ve been in office, way over 1 million.”

— Trump, remarks at rally in Phoenix, Aug. 22, 2017 Often the truest sign of a president’s political standing is his economic record when he runs for reelection. If the economy is in the dumps, he loses. (See Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush.) If the economy is doing well, or appears on the rebound, he wins. (See Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.)

Trump’s approval ratings now are relatively poor, despite a good economy, which is probably why he mentions it at every turn. What is striking is how he talks about job creation — that any job growth is essentially his doing. In our recollection, this is different than other, recent presidents.

How much does Trump have to do with job creation in the first six months of his presidency?

The Facts

Here’s a sampling of how other presidents have spoken about job creation.

“Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.”

— Barack Obama

— Barack Obama “America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace”

— George W. Bush

— George W. Bush “We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs, the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years, the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest African American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record, the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years.”

— Bill Clinton

— Bill Clinton “As we have worked together to bring down spending, tax rates and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; America has created more jobs and better, higher-paying jobs; family income has risen for four straight years; and America’s poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years.”

— Ronald Reagan

Note the difference. The economy has added jobs, America has added jobs, “we have worked together” and so forth. Obama, in particular, also liked to say that “our businesses” have added jobs, so that way he could cite the better private-employment numbers; the drop in state and local government employment during much of his presidency kept dragging down overall employment numbers.

(The quotes above are taken from State of the Union addresses, and we would welcome reader contributions of quotes by these or other presidents that mimic Trump’s “I” phrasing, which we will include in an update.)

All presidents try to pat themselves on the back if the economy is doing well. But Trump drops any pretense and simply says that he, himself, created more than 1 million jobs in six months.

But economists say that presidents don’t really deserve credit for job creation, especially at this stage of a presidency. “Trump overuses the pronoun ‘I,’ always, but presidents always claim more credit than they deserve when things go well,” said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University professor and former vice chair of the Federal Reserve.

Blinder in 2015 co-wrote a paper that explored why the U.S. economy since World War II appears to do better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones. (“Over a typical four-year presidency the U.S. economy grew by 18.5% when the president was a Democrat, but only by 10.6% when he was a Republican.”) An empirical analysis found much of the difference could be explained by a blend of good policy and good luck, but the authors could “not attribute any of the partisan growth gap to fiscal or monetary policy.” Instead, oil shocks and productivity growth — both of which are tenuously connected to a president’s policies — played a more substantial role in the difference.

In short, it’s difficult to find a link between a president’s policies and economic growth. In terms of employment, a president can hire and fire federal workers but has little direct impact on private employment.

“President Trump is obviously incorrect if we interpret his statement literally, because, as you say, it is the nation’s (mostly private) employers who are responsible for the employment growth,” Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution wrote in an email. “The federal government has reduced employment (by 7,000 workers) on a seasonally adjusted basis or increased employment (with no seasonal adjustment) by just 21,000 since January, so federal payroll changes have not contributed materially to the change in U.S. payroll employment.”

Share this article Share

In the first six months of Trump’s presidency, there have been slightly more than 1 million jobs created, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But Burtless noted there’s been very little change in the trend in employment in the first six months of 2017, compared with the same period in the previous four years. In fact, the gain in payroll employment in the January-through-July period was a bit slower in 2017 compared with the previous four years, whether measured as an absolute rise in the number of nonfarm payroll jobs or as a percentage of employment in January of the indicated year.

In other words, there’s been barely any change from the Obama-era economy, which Trump bashed at every turn when he was running for president.

Trump might have a better case for bragging if he could point to major new policies that had been rapidly adopted and quickly implemented, as was the case with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, Ronald Reagan in 1981 and Barack Obama in 2009. But Trump has not achieved much on the legislative front. In any case, as we noted, Blinder could not find much impact from fiscal policy. Economists, after all, have disagreed about whether Obama’s fiscal stimulus helped or hurt the economy.

The Pinocchio Test

As a general rule of thumb, the Fact Checker automatically assigns Two Pinocchios for claims that a president is responsible for job growth. That kind of statement simply lacks context — and ignores the fact that it takes time and effort for presidential policies to work their way through a country as large as the United States. Trump’s rhetoric, suggesting he is personally responsible for 1 million jobs being created, almost pushes it to a three. But at its core, this is a statement that lacks a lot of context about how the U.S. economy functions.

They claimed more progress than has been made.

That tendency to overreach extended to trade and the economy as Trump visited Japan, South Korea, Japan and then Vietnam, where he told U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War that the Department of Veterans Affairs has made “amazing” strides and already “is a whole new place.”

Veterans Day prompted President Donald Trump and his administration to take stock of what’s been done to fix health care for those in uniform. They claimed more progress than has been made.

His remarks and a White House account of progress at the VA did not acknowledge old problems that persist. For example, a key effort to improve waiting times by revamping the VA’s electronic medical record system may not be completed for eight more years — when Trump will be out of office.

A look at some statements about the VA and other topics arising from his travels and over the past week:

WHITE HOUSE: “President Trump signed the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, taking action to streamline the appeals process for disability compensation claims within the VA. More than 470,000 veterans are awaiting pending decisions regarding their appeals.”

THE FACTS: Trump signed the bill in August, part of a bid to reduce a rapidly growing claims backlog, but its immediate impact is overstated, as it will have no effect on the 470,000 pending claims.

Under the legislation, veterans will be able to file “express” appeals if they waive their right to a hearing or the ability to submit new evidence.

While lawmakers hope the legislation ultimately could reduce average wait times to less than a year, it applies almost entirely to newly filed appeals.

Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has said the VA would need Congress to approve an additional $800 million for “hiring surges” of additional appeals processors if the VA hoped to clear its current backlog within 10 years.

TRUMP: “Right now, our trade with Japan is not fair and it’s not open, but I know it will be, soon. We want free and reciprocal trade, but right now our trade with Japan is not free and it’s not reciprocal.” And: “Many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan.” — remarks to business leaders in Tokyo on Monday.

THE FACTS: When Trump calls for reciprocity in Japan-U.S. trade, he might want to be careful what he wishes for.

With autos, for example, Japan places no tariff on fully assembled vehicles that are imported. But the U.S. has a 2.5 percent tariff on most imported vehicles — 25 percent on pickup trucks. That imbalance — or lack of reciprocity — favors the U.S.

It’s true U.S. vehicle sales in Japan pale in comparison with Japanese sales in the U.S. Detroit has long complained about regulations that stop U.S. carmakers from opening dealerships or selling cars in Japan. But there are other reasons for the disparity in the auto trade, as well. For example, Japan uses right-hand-drive vehicles; the U.S. mainly makes left-hand-drive vehicles in its domestic industry.

And Trump’s point about Japanese vehicles pouring into the U.S. is somewhat off the mark. Made-in-Japan vehicles are a distinct minority of the vehicles sold in the U.S. by Japanese automakers.

More than half the vehicles sold in the U.S. by Japanese manufacturers are built in the U.S., says the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Three-quarters of them are built in North America.

WHITE HOUSE statement Thursday: “President Trump announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will adopt the same Electronic Health Record as the Department of Defense. VA’s adoption … will ultimately result in all patient data residing in one common system, enabling the immediate availability of service members’ medical records and seamless care between the departments.”

THE FACTS: While the administration did announce in June that it would overhaul the VA’s aging information technology system, Shulkin admitted to Congress last month that the project to revamp electronic medical records won’t be completed for seven to eight years. The full costs of the project also are not known and have yet to be budgeted.

An upgraded IT system is central to the VA’s effort to reduce wait times for medical care as well as to fulfill Trump’s promise of increasing private care options for veterans. Under Shulkin’s plan to expand the Choice private-sector program, the VA would outsource more routine veterans’ care to private providers including MinuteClinics while treating more complex injuries. Success of that plan requires a seamless sharing of medical records not only with the Pentagon but also with private physicians, a capability the VA does not currently have.

Shulkin also has yet to negotiate pricing for the no-bid contract with the company that designed the Pentagon’s IT system, estimated to cost at least $16 billion. The big price tag has spurred bills in Congress to require regular updates from the VA on timeliness and cost projections, as well as risks such as breaches to patient privacy.

WILBUR ROSS, U.S. commerce secretary: “Today’s signings are a good example of how we can productively build up our bilateral trade.” — remarks Thursday in Beijing.

XI JINPING, China’s president: “During this visit, the two sides signed over $250 billion U.S. of commercial deals and two-way investment agreements.” — remarks Thursday in Beijing.

THE FACTS: Papers signed in China during Trump’s visit were largely a packaging of previously worked-out deals, tentative investments, statements of intent and extensions of business with existing Chinese customers, with some new orders. They do not point to a turnaround in deep-seated trade tensions between China and the U.S.

Papers signed in China during Trump’s visit were largely a packaging of previously worked-out deals, tentative investments, statements of intent and extensions of business with existing Chinese customers, with some new orders. They do not point to a turnaround in deep-seated trade tensions between China and the U.S.

Such signing ceremonies in China are often just that, ceremonial. They typically represent purchases that Chinese customers already planned to make and held off on announcing. General Motors’ $2.2 billion piece of the package, for example, consists mostly of selling parts to its existing joint venture with the Chinese government.

Alaska, however, welcomed an agreement that could spur construction of a long-sought pipeline to ship natural gas from the North Slope to a port for export to Asia. Oil companies backed away from the project, but the agreement with Chinese interests means all parties will work toward a decision by the end of next year on whether to proceed.

WHITE HOUSE: “President Trump has ensured continued access to care in the Veterans Choice Program by signing the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act, authorizing $2.1 billion in additional funds for the Veterans Choice Program.”

THE FACTS: This statement glosses over one of several budget shortfalls by the VA. Congress was forced in August to approve $2.1 billion in emergency money to keep Choice running after the VA had repeatedly understated costs of the program, assuring lawmakers for much of the year that money would last until January. Shulkin subsequently revealed an emergency shortfall in June that threatened medical care for tens of thousands of veterans.

The $2.1 billion was intended to last until February. But weeks after receiving the money, the VA acknowledged that money for Choice would again run out sooner than expected, requiring Congress to approve additional stopgap financing before the end of the year or face disruptions to veterans’ health care.

Lawmakers have yet to act, in part as the Trump administration sorts out longer-term costs to the private-sector program.

WHITE HOUSE: “The VA has launched its ‘Access and Quality Tool,’ allowing veterans to see online the wait times at VA locations.”



THE FACTS: An effort started by Shulkin when he was VA undersecretary of health in President Barack Obama’s administration, the VA website www.accesstocare.va.gov provides data on wait times as well as on veterans’ satisfaction ratings in getting timely appointments, something that no other health care system in the country does.

Still, major veterans groups such as Veterans of Foreign Wars have faulted the data for being misleading and not depicting wait times the way a typical person would view it.

The Government Accountability Office, for instance, has noted that the data for returning patients do not include the amount of wait time from when a veteran initially asks for care and when a scheduler reaches out to set an appointment, which it said could be lengthy. In addition, GAO earlier this year continued to find evidence that VA data can be unreliable because of schedulers recording wrong dates or changing dates outright, though the VA says it is implementing new checks and training to help identify “outliers” in scheduling.

Veterans of Foreign Wars told Congress last month that its survey found only 67 percent of veterans said they had obtained a VA appointment within 30 days, less than the 93 percent that VA reports.

___

WHITE HOUSE: “The White House has opened a brand new VA Hotline staffed principally by veterans and direct family members of veterans to ensure that no complaint goes unaddressed.”

THE FACTS: It opened, but it did not get off to a smooth start. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to create a “private White House hotline” answered by a real person 24 hours a day to take complaints from veterans, leading the VA to create a hotline beginning in June. Originally scheduled to be fully operational by Aug. 15, it has encountered some delays. In a letter to the VA last month, Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, complained, “The White House is frequently routing these calls back to local VA offices, which are often understaffed and do not have the ability to address the additional casework in a timely manner.”

Tester noted the VA already had several existing options for receiving complaints from veterans and urged better coordination to make sure no one falls through the cracks.

Trump can rightfully brag about the U.S. economy, but it’s not quite as exceptional as he says, and he can’t yet legitimately claim that his record on job creation is vastly superior to Obama’s.

TRUMP: “Numbers are phenomenal over the last — since November 8th, Election Day. Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We’ve gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I’ve reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself.” — remarks to business leaders in Tokyo, Monday. Tweet from previous weekend: “Unemployment is down to 4.1%, lowest in 17 years. 1.5 million new jobs created since I took office. Highest stock Market ever, up $5.4 trill.”

THE FACTS: His numbers are close to the mark. Trump can rightfully brag about the U.S. economy, but it’s not quite as exceptional as he says, and he can’t yet legitimately claim that his record on job creation is vastly superior to Obama’s. Many of the economic figures he cites are advancing a recovery from the Great Recession that dates back to the middle of 2009.

The unemployment rate did slip to 4.1 percent in October. But that was in part because many Americans gave up searching for work — one of the criticisms Trump made of Obama’s record during the 2016 campaign.

READ MORE: 6 takeaways from the October jobs report

Trump also takes credit for helping create on average 168,500 jobs a month, but Obama in 2016 averaged about 187,000 jobs a month. Of course, hiring should slow as the unemployment rate declines because fewer people are searching for work. When someone stops seeking a job and drops out of the labor force, this person is no longer counted among the officially unemployed.

As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its previous peak in March 2013 and has been setting records ever since. The promise of corporate tax cuts by Trump has helped the stock market, but many of the gains rest on the foundations of an economic recovery that saw corporate profits climb.

President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order Monday announcing the U.S. will withdraw from negotiating the TPP, or Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.

“Great thing for the American worker, what we just did,” he told the press corps after signing, as his chief adviser Steve Bannon, former executive editor of Breitbart, a platform for the so-called ""alt-right,"" looked on with a tight grin.

During a campaign stop in Ohio this summer, Trump said, ""The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country.”

As divisive as that language sounds, whoever got into the White House was likely to ditch the TPP. Hillary Clinton, adopting a progressive issue from Bernie Sanders, also came out against the deal during her run, saying in August, ""I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election and I’ll oppose it as president.”

So what was the TPP, and why did some people hate it so much — on both the right and the left?

Jobs Created and Destroyed

The Trans-Pacific Partnership, pushed hard by the Obama administration, was essentially an attempt to create a single market for the U.S. and 11 countries that border the Pacific Ocean, including Canada, Mexico, and Chile. The idea was to make goods flow more freely and cheaply between all partners — who together represented one third of global trading.

Specifically, the TPP's largest goal was to maintain U.S. trade dominance in Asia, bringing the various trading partners under America's wing as a way to ward off China's growing economic influence, said MSNBC business correspondent Ali Velshi.

The idea was that if everyone brought down taxes on exported goods, U.S. companies would pay less for imports — while benefiting from cheaper labor overseas.

According to research by the Peterson Institute, the deal would have increased U.S. exports by $123 billion. Using back-of-the-envelope math, Obama's White House had estimated an increase of 650,000 jobs.

Proponents said the net effect of this would lead to overall economic improvement and stimulate the economy and thus jobs and better wages for all, even blue collar workers.

In ""The Case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" Mireya Solís, a foreign policy senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, wrote that the deal would ""promote jobs in the sectors where we enjoy comparative advantage,"" would ""ensure fair competition,"" and ""put pressure on non-member countries to reform their state capitalism trading practices.""

A Trade Deal Without Trade Benefits

But when it comes to deals like these, including NAFTA, another trade deal also on Trump's chopping block, ""It just hasn't worked. That's the problem,"" said Velshi.

The issue is that although the government is helping creating wealth for these companies, there's no mandate that they spend it on hiring or wages.

""Companies love free trade,"" said Velshi. ""Companies get to share profits with shareholders, the government gets the taxes, but workers don't get their fair share.""

""This is all diplomacy. There is no benefit,"" said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""The idea was diplomatic rather than economic.""

Related: What Is the Trans-Pacific Partnership?

Moreover, as the deal went along and corporations began influencing it behind the scenes, it became a multinational corporate grab-bag, said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, a non-profit advocacy group that came out strong against the TPP.

""The TPP's 5,000+ pages actually had very little to do with trade. Instead, corporations tried to turn it into a wish list for policies that they knew would never pass through Congress,"" said Greer.

These included labor rights rules unions said were toothless, rules that could have delayed generics and lead to higher drug prices, and expanded international copyright protection.

""That's what led to such a mass movement against the TPP, and brought together so many different groups to oppose it,"" she said.

Now that the TPP is effectively dead, Trump's administration will have to make separate trade deals with each country. That can take time. Negotiations for TPP itself began in 2008.

In the meantime, the protectionist measures instead promised by Trump could set off a damaging trade war. And with the U.S. bowed out of the multilateral agreement, it creates an opportunity for China to make attractive agreements with the Pacific Rim countries to trade with them instead.

That could lead to higher prices for the cheap imports that Americans have become addicted to — so your kid's plastic Paw Patrol toys at Wal-Mart could get a little pricier."

“By most of the standard measurements the economy is doing well, perhaps a bit better than it had been doing in the previous eight years,” said Jeffrey Miron, director of economic studies at the Cato Institute, who said the United States has benefited from a broadly rising global economy that has buoyed both established and emerging markets.

“I would say that the economy and the markets have done well in spite of the presidential turmoil that’s been part of the administration, at least to date,” said Yung Ma, chief investment strategist for BMO Wealth Management.

Deregulation is a winner

Although the White House and Congress have, thus far, had little legislative success to speak of on economic matters, economists on the right and the left agree that the Trump administration does get credit for growth insofar as it comes from relaxing regulations on everything from oil drillers to big banks, even if they differ on the expected ramifications.

“The perception of the business community and the markets is the amount of new regulation we’re going to see over the next four years is much less than we would've seen if we had a Democratic administration,” Miron said.

“The economy and the markets have done well in spite of the presidential turmoil.”

“I think the regulatory side probably does give polluters and people making dangerous chemicals a feeling that their investments will make future output more profitable,” said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. “They’re not going to interfere what’s been a very good run in business profitability since about 2010. That shows up in stock market valuations,” he said.

Unfortunately, the extent to which ordinary Americans can reap the benefits of those market gains is limited by a vexing lack of wage growth, even as the labor market has rebounded to near-full employment.

“The average American is looking for two things — they want to see higher wages and want to see the market moving higher,” said Terry Simpson, a multi-asset strategist at BlackRock. “We’ve had the benefit of the latter; however, we’re still at the point of where average hourly earnings in the United States are not breaking out and that’s somewhat of an issue,” he said. “If you’re not seeing higher wages, you don’t have more money to put into your 401(k) to reap the benefits of this higher market.”

The rich are doing best of all

The result is that an outsized share of the market’s gains have been accumulated by the very rich. The Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances found that the top 1 percent now controls nearly 40 percent of the nation’s wealth.

There are growing indications that Americans, and Trump voters in particular, are still feeling left out of the recovery. According to a new poll of residents in Trump-supporting counties across the U.S. from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, more than 40 percent say the country is worse off today than before the presidential election, compared to just under one-third who say the situation has improved.

The GOP is pinning its hopes for a major legislative victory — and its success in next year’s midterm elections — on its tax plan, but at this point, companies don’t need the boost, analysts say. They are investing and hiring in response to market fundamentals that have increased demand domestically as well as abroad — a trend likely to continue even without a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate.

“Even if they’re not passed, the economy is on stable and strong footing,” Ma said. “A big factor that’s kicked in over the last three quarters is business spending — it has contributed meaningfully to U.S. growth.”

“It’s not one thing,” Joe Quinlan, head of market and thematic strategy at Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust, said of the forces propelling the American economy forward. “Consumer confidence is elevated, [and] it’s the corporate sector hiring and investing more, it’s exports picking up because of the weaker dollar.”

Fears of protectionism

But while Trump might not have fired up the economy, he could still throw cold water on it. Economists express concern that the administration’s embrace of protectionist policies on trade and immigration could put a drag on future economic growth.

“If this expansion is going to go beyond this year, we’re going to need more people,” Burtless said. “I’m afraid a lot of the legal barriers are going to be deterring highly skilled people” like engineers and software developers, he said. This would rob the U.S. not only of the taxes those workers would pay on their earnings, but of innovations that could contribute to their employers’ profitability and the additional tax revenue that would generate. A perception that the United States is hostile to immigration would hurt its competitiveness in a global marketplace.

Analysts are also watching carefully for signals from the president’s Asia trip for any indications that a shakeup in trade relations is coming.

“If there’s a move towards protectionism, that can be a very big detriment and a headwind not only to our economy but to our global peers,” Simpson said, adding that it is in the United States’ best interest to look out for the economic health of our trading partners to prevent a drop-off in demand for American exports.

“It’s not just one country against each other,” Ma said. “Trade relationships are very difficult to unwind once they get in place. Supply chains are built around them,” he said, and disrupting that can create an economic domino effect.

And if a self-inflicted or outside shock such as a major geopolitical conflict in the Middle East did significantly slow the momentum of economic growth, economists worry that the GOP’s debt-heavy tax plan — which multiple analyses have found would deliver the most benefit to the wealthiest taxpayers, including Trump himself — could leave the United States without the tools to stop the slide.

“The benefits look to be front-loaded, and the concern here is if you do get into a recession then you’ve kind of exhausted some of the monetary policy stimulus but you’ve also exhausted the fiscal stimulus,” Simpson said. “That is a worry.”"

During his first hundred days in office, President Trump signed several immigration-related Executive Orders (EOs). These could imply substantive changes to US immigration policies. The stance of these executive actions is in line with the aggressively anti-immigrant positions expressed during the electoral campaign. Two EOs have restricted travel from some Muslim-majority countries – but they have been challenged in the judicial court system and eventually blocked. One has revamped the system for deportation of illegal immigrants and another has pushed forward with plans to extend the wall along the US-Mexico border. Still another EO promotes the ‘Buy American and Hire American’ principle and promises to overhaul the H-1B visa programme, making it harder for US companies to hire foreign temporary workers.

Without real legislative action, which would take significant time and effort due to the need for Congressional approval, the power of these executive measures is limited. However, they all point in the direction of implementing a much more restrictive immigration policy relative to previous – both Democrat and Republican – administrations. This column documents the critical aspects of these policy changes, in order to assess their likely economic impact. Given that these policy changes may have large adverse effects, we will conclude by discussing the political-economy drivers of these policy changes and make educated guesses as to how the current administration might move forward.

Content of Executive Orders

The two ‘travel related’ EOs ban travellers and immigrants from six Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, as well as Iraq in the first executive order) for a temporary period (90 days).1 However, while the first EO targeted anyone from these countries who is foreign-born, independently from their visa status, the second EO excluded from the ban the following groups: those holding green cards, those with already- issued visas, and refugees who have already been granted refugee status by the time of the EO. Both EOs also block refugees from any country for 120 days; the first included a ban on Syrian refugees for an indefinite period, though it did permit exceptions for refugees from religious minorities. Finally, the EOs set the quota for refugees per year to 50,000, reducing the quota of 110,000 planned by the Obama administration for FY 2017. These EOs were suspended as of April 2017.

In EO 13768 (White House, January 25, 2017), the Trump administration also directed US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) to accelerate the illegal immigrant deportation process by prioritising aliens involved with any criminal activity, and not just those facing serious charges, a change from the Obama administration. Trump’s proposed budget has also included funding increases for border agents to allow ICE to process deportation at a higher rate and intensity.

Trump’s executive actions on deportation of illegal immigrants have met with some political resistance and opposition. A number of ‘sanctuary cities’have emerged that attempt to shield undocumented migrants, although the Trump administration has responded with threats of cutting off federal aid. This issue is currently in the courts and, as of April 2017, a Federal judge had ruled Trump’s executive actions on sanctuary cities unconstitutional.

The Trump administration also issued EO 13767 (White House, January 25, 2017) with plans to build a wall, which would cover 1000 miles of the 1,900 miles of the US-Mexico border.2 The White House estimates for costs of construction range from $10- 12 billion, though independent analysts suggest it could be perhaps as much as $25 billion (Lee and Kessler 2017).

Finally, EO 13789 (White House, April 18, 2017) includes provisions to review and tighten the H-1B visa programme with the goal of increasing the number of hurdles that companies would have to clear to hire a foreign-born worker.

Predicted economic effects

These policies have economic consequences, both for the changes they imply and for the fact that they signal the intention of making it even harder, in the future, for US companies, universities, laboratories and research centres to hire foreigners. While the administration has communicated that it intends to reform the immigration system toward one that is ‘merit based’, its actions and announcements suggest that the overall number of foreign workers – temporary visas and possibly permanent immigration permits – will be reduced.

The executive orders banning travel from the Muslim majority countries have affected mainly students, scholars, and highly educated professionals. The majority of temporary visa holders from those countries work as professionals and many are in professions involving Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). The ban has created costly delays, complicated legal issues and uncertainty for anyone seeking to hire those immigrants. It has also discouraged highly educated potential immigrants from those and other Muslim countries from choosing the United States as a destination, to the detriment of the US academic and scientific community.

Research reveals considerable evidence that foreign scientists and engineers contribute substantially to US innovation (Kerr and Lincoln 2010), that foreign college-educated workers are more likely to innovate (Hunt, 2010) and that productivity at the local level benefits significantly from their presence (Peri et al. 2015). Additional evidence shows that foreign high-skilled STEM workers complement native-born workers, especially young ones, in US companies (Kerr et al. 2015), and that they make considerable contributions to US productivity growth (Bound et al. 2017).

Overall, these studies suggest that a reduction in high-skilled immigrants is likely to reduce – rather than to increase – opportunities, productivity and wages of the native- born American workforce, especially for the college educated.

The executive order intensifying the efforts for deportation of undocumented immigrants not only threatens the day-to-day life of several million people, it also undermines the economic viability of entire sectors of the US economy. An estimated eight million undocumented aliens currently work in manual jobs in the agriculture, construction, hospitality, food and personal-services industries. Many take on the low paid, physically demanding jobs that American-born workers – who are typically better educated, but also aging – do not want any longer.

Nevertheless, undocumented workers also provide important services to sectors that employ large numbers of Americans workers in different type of jobs, for example as supervisors, managers, accountants, salespersons, and IT specialists. Less-educated workers tend to complement and extend the work of middle to highly educated Americans (Peri 2012, Ottaviano and Peri 2012). Without the undocumented migrant workers, a number of sectors of the US economy are expected to slow their growth and terminate the jobs currently held by American-born workers as well. Another consequence of the higher US costs could be that American companies have further need to offshore more jobs and import more foreign-produced goods in order to remain competitive (Ottaviano et al. 2015).

US domestic production of several agricultural products could dramatically shrink or even disappear, their imports will increase and their prices become higher. The prices of services in the hospitality, food and personal-services industries may also increase (Cortes 2008), and those sectors will slow their growth. Certain urban economies, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix, attribute much of their growth to reliance on jobs of less-skilled immigrant workers; these cities may experience bottlenecks and shortages that could result in sectoral decline that would multiply through the local economy (see Moretti 2014).

There is the potential that a few of the manual, low-skilled jobs will be taken-up by Americans, leading to marginal improvements in wages for some local workers. However, the negative impact on job creation of complementary jobs could be more significant (see Ottaviano and Peri 2012, Peri and Sparber 2009, Chassamboulli and Peri 2015) as US workers benefit much more from growth in the intermediate-skill jobs than from manual-intensive, low-skilled employment opportunities.

It is also important to emphasise that the very expensive project of building a wall with Mexico will have economic consequence, in that it will divert government resources that could be used more profitably elsewhere. The core rationale for such a wall is questionable, as immigration from Mexico has been declining steadily for more than a decade, and the number of undocumented workers has not changed since 2006 (Krogstad et al. 2017). Immigration in the last decade has grown largely because of the sizeable inflow of highly educated young Asians – mainly from India and China – rather than of less-educated Mexicans. In ignoring this fact, public resources will be used to target a problem that no longer exists. Mexico has undergone an economic and demographic transition, so that the number of its low-educated young people (who are those more likely to emigrate) is now much smaller than in the 1990s. The border fence already prevents most of the attempted border crossings and existing projections of economists (e.g. Hanson and McIntosh 2016) show a steady decline in the inflow from that country.

Finally, the main long-run cost of these executive orders could be that they create a climate of perceived hostility to new immigration and decreased openness to foreign workers, including the highly educated ones, and especially those from certain countries. This could divert the highly and internationally mobile scientists, engineers and professionals towards countries such as Canada, Australia and China, eroding the US excellence in their areas, which is a pillar of US economic leadership. While the impact of the executive orders is, as yet, small enough not to be of long-run concern, a significant decrease in highly skilled immigrants could have more sizeable and permanent effects on growth.

Political economy drivers and implications

It is not surprising that candidate Donald Trump embraced demands for populist measures on immigration, during the Presidential campaign. Public opinion is opposed to immigration in most destination countries, including the United States (Scheve and Slaughter 2001, Mayda 2006). In addition, while the dominant narrative in US political circles is that immigration is a ‘problem’ for Republicans, the opposite turns out to be the case in some counties and states, including those that may be crucial for electoral outcomes. What Trump has understood and exploited is that there is a political pay-off for Republicans in these localities if they ‘act tough’ on immigration during electoral campaigns.

Systematic evidence from a recent analysis of immigration and electoral outcomes between 1990 and 2010 finds that, in US counties where less skilled workers are a majority, the economy is not urban and local public spending is large, US voters responded to large recent waves of immigration by rewarding the Republican party and its anti-immigrant platform (Mayda et al. 2017). This can be explained in an economic perspective: while immigrants produce aggregate benefits for the economy and employment/wage gains for most Americans, these are mostly for workers that complement immigrants, i.e., the typical example is a highly skilled worker in an urban area. The perception of less skilled non-urban workers, often relying on public assistance programmes, is that they are penalised by immigration. This drives some voters’ demands for populist measures on migration, which Trump has used to his political advantage.

Overall, it is very concerning that the current administration has moved forward, in practice, with these significant changes in immigration policy. It is hard to believe that a businessperson who has employed immigrants himself does not understand the likely economic costs of these policy proposals, especially those affecting skilled migration. One hope is that the administration ultimately chooses to leave behind these clumsy populist attempts at changing US immigration policy. The US economy needs immigration policy reform, but not of this sort. What is really needed is improved efficiency, flexibility and allowing more freedom to individuals and markets, including the labour market – not the imposition of more restrictions and constraints.

The National Security Presidential Memorandum that he signed on stage in Miami in front of a raucous crowd of Cuban exiles prohibits U.S. visitors organizing their own individual people-to-people educational travel and prohibits financial transactions with Cuban state enterprises managed by the armed forces. What is likely to be the real economic effect of these measures?

According to a recent Brookings Institution study by Richard E. Feinberg and Richard Newfarmer, Tourism in Cuba: Riding the Wave toward Sustainable Prosperity , the non-state sector—private bed and breakfasts (casas particulares) rentals, restaurants, taxis, tour guides, etc.—receives about 31 percent of all tourist dollars. U.S. visitors on individualized trips are more likely to stay in casas particulares, take private cabs, and hire private guides than large organized groups, which are channeled through state tourist agencies and booked into state-owned hotels. Consequently, although President Trump’s policy purports to boost Cuba’s private sector, the prohibition on individualized people-to-people travel will likely hit the private sector hardest.

If the ban on individualized people-to-people travel were to cut non-diaspora U.S. visits by, say, 20 percent, it would mean a reduction in the number of foreign visitors to Cuba of only one or two percent. Whether the decline in U.S. visitors is 10 percent, 20 percent or 50 percent depends on the actual severity of yet-to-be issued regulations, the dampening effects, if any, in other markets (e.g., Canada and Europe), and the response of the Cuban government. But whatever the number, the overall impact will be smaller than the Trump trumpeted headlines would suggest. This is not the end of the world for the Cuban economy.

Excluding Cuban Americans, the number of U.S. visitors in 2016 was 284,937—just 7 percent of Cuba’s 4.1 million foreign visitors that year. Many of those U.S. visitors went on trips that would still be allowed under the new rules; most are already traveling with groups tours, which are unaffected by the new regulations . Moreover, in general the biggest determinant of visits to tourism destinations is the availability of air transport, and Trump’s new measures do not affect either current or future civil air connections to Cuba.

Gaviota, the military enterprise in the tourism sector, accounts for about 18,000 rooms (as of 2015) of about 71,000 total rooms available for international tourists—some 25 percent. If you discount the three-star hotels as not suitable for international tourists, that share rises to about 30 percent because Gaviota has a larger share of the four and five star rooms. Casas particulares account for almost the same number—some 16,000 rooms. Together, the four- and five-star non-military, state-owned hotel rooms and the private casas particulares have 42,000 rooms available for foreign visitors—ample space for accommodating U.S. visitors without patronizing enterprises managed by the military.

[T]he whole discussion of the military’s role in the tourism sector misses the point.

Even for spending that goes to Gaviota and its parent holding company, GAESA, our numbers suggest some 60 percent to 70 percent of this spending goes to Cuban workers for wages, to local suppliers, and maintenance and utility expenditures largely unaffiliated with the military. Consequently, measures intended to reduce tourist spending in the Gaviota complex mostly hurt ordinary Cubans.

In a way, the whole discussion of the military’s role in the tourism sector misses the point. U.S. dollars contributing to profits in a hotel run by Gaviota and dollar profits in a non-military, state-owned hotel end up in the same place: the Cuban Treasury, as state revenue. No doubt military enterprises, like other state enterprises, retain some revenue as reserves and for bureaucratic perquisites, but the central government, not the military, determines the ultimate allocation of state revenues in the national budget. It is hard to argue that the military’s market share in hotels gives them a claim on resources that their participation the Communist Party’s politburo does not already give them.

Nor will a reduction in the revenue generated by Gaviota impair the military’s political influence. The military has been, since 1959, a central pillar of the Cuban political system, second only to the Communist Party. The leadership of the armed forces is well-integrated into the leadership of the Communist Party, and the military’s influence rests on its historical role in the revolution, its internationalist missions abroad, and its embodiment of Cuban nationalism.

Another relevant point: Cubans largely control their own destiny in the tourism sector, despite the new U.S. sanctions, since the main constraints to the sector’s growth are Cuban domestic economic policies. Remaining competitive in tourism is a more significant challenge than U.S. sanctions. The last two decades have seen an erosion in Cuba’s competitiveness relative to other Caribbean destinations; the Cubans will have to raise the quality of their offerings if they are to realize tourism’s maximum benefit to national development. Feinberg and Newfarmer’s study outlines how they can do that.

In short, the sanctions President Trump has imposed on travel are not likely to put much of a near-term dent in the Cuban economy already weathering the loss of Venezuelan subsidies. Nor will they reduce the influence of the armed forces. But they will have a disproportionately negative impact on Cuba’s emerging private sector and on non-military employment in linkage industries—not to mention restricting Americans’ right to travel."

Trump made his announcement Wednesday before an audience of auto workers in Ypsilianti, Michigan, where he declared that the ""assault on the American auto industry is over.""

""My administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations, to lower the job-crushing taxes and to ensure a level playing field for all American companies and workers,'' he said.

Trump was expected to set aside the fuel economy standards approved in 2012 and to be gradually increased to 23 kilometers per liter of gasoline by 2025.

Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency will review those standards by an April 2018 deadline to see, in the words of EPA chief Scott Pruitt, ""that this national program is good for consumers and good for the environment.""

The White House contends Obama broke an earlier agreement with the auto industry to review the standards by 2018. Advocates of the tougher standards dispute that.

The year 2018 ""was the deadline by which they were obligated to complete the review. No agreement was broken,"" Therese Langer, transportation program director at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) told VOA News.

“The agencies completed a comprehensive technical assessment report in July 2016, which made clear that the standards as adopted remained feasible and cost-effective. At that point, making the decision promptly was consistent with the goal of providing adequate lead time for manufacturer product planning.”





Setting standards

The Trump administration wants to set standards “that are technologically and economically feasible,” according to the official who briefed reporters on condition he not be named.

Some automakers argue that the tougher standards will mean consumers would have to pay thousands of dollars extra for a new car.

But the administration cannot scrap the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) mandate completely without Congress' consent. Lawmakers originally approved the CAFE regulations in the mid-1970s, following the oil embargo by OPEC members.

The current issue deals with rules on fuel economy and emissions affecting automobiles that will appear in showrooms from the years 2022 through 2025.

The proposed vehicle standards for those model years “will save consumers tens of billions of dollars at the pump and help domestic automakers stay competitive in a global vehicle market that is moving steadily toward highly efficient vehicles,” ACEEE executive director Steve Nadel told VOA.



Detroit automakers

But the move to cars and trucks that do not rely on conventional fossil fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, has slowed, say those in the Trump administration and in the auto industry.

“Because we have low gas prices, consumers just aren’t buying those vehicles” that run on batteries in addition to or instead of fuel, said the Trump administration official briefing reporters at the White House.

One hitch for the industry and other proponents of the looser standards is that 13 states say they will follow California in adhering to stricter fleet fuel efficiencies – a market that makes up more than 40 percent of the U.S. automotive sales market.

“That’s an issue we’ll have to confront, but it’s farther down the road,” the senior White House official said when asked about that issue by reporters.

California and New York are intervening in a lawsuit filed by auto manufacturers that seeks to set aside the existing EPA regulations because, the suit contends, the emission standards aren't realistic.

California Governor Jerry Brown also sent a letter to the EPA's Pruitt calling the announced effort to rollback standards ""an unconscionable gift to polluters.""

""Once again, you've put the interests of big oil ahead of clean air and politics ahead of science,"" Brown wrote.

Brown's letter also said that EPA research suggests the current emission targets for 2022-2025 would save consumers more than $1,650 per vehicle, drastically cut oil consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions by more than 500 million metric tons."

He also called for protectionist measures, directly clashing with recommendations contained in a key International Monetary Fund (IMF) report released the same day.



Saying his administration was working on a “fantastic” economic bill “which nobody knows about”, Trump offered no details but said the bill contained “economic-development incentives” for companies to stay in the US. Companies sending jobs overseas, he said, would “get penalised severely”.

“It’s both a carrot and a stick,” he said. “It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so – if you leave, it’s going to be very tough for you to think that you’re going to be able to sell your product back into our country.”



The IMF report on the global economy contained a rebuke to protectionist policies. “Although the chances of advanced economy policies turning inward have diminished in the near term, pressures for increased protectionism have not disappeared and ought to be resisted,” it read.

According to the report, increased growth is forecast in the US, the eurozone, Japan and China this year, with world trade expected to grow 4.2% – its fastest rate in six years. The last time the global economy grew so fast was in 2010, in a short-lived recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.

This year’s performance is significantly stronger, the IMF chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, told the Financial Times. “This is not bounce-back from a sharp deceleration; this is an acceleration from the fairly tepid growth rates of recent years, so that’s really good news,” he said.

Trump nonetheless feels the US economy is in need of protection. Asked by Forbes if he was comfortable with measures that the private sector would largely oppose, he said: “Very comfortable. What I want to do is reciprocal.

“See, I think the concept of reciprocal is a very nice concept. If somebody is charging us 50%, we should charge them 50%. Right now they charge us 50%, and we charge them nothing. That doesn’t work with me.”

Trump’s words echoed those in the pages of The Art of the Deal, his bestselling 1980s advertisement for his own his business acumen. He has often described how he uses inflated numbers as a negotiating tactic, often then employing the same numbers to declare victory after the fact.

Forbes quoted Trump’s words from 1984, when he bought a now long-defunct franchise, the New Jersey Generals, in a now long-defunct competition, the United States Football League.

“When I build something for somebody, I always add $50m or $60m on to the price,” the magazine quoted him as saying. “My guys come in, they say it’s going to cost $75m. I say it’s going to cost $125m and I build it for $100m. Basically, I did a lousy job. But they think I did a great job.”

Trump told Forbes about his current proposal to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% – after months of saying he wanted to go even lower, to 15%. “I was actually saying 15 for the purpose of getting to 20,” he said. “As you know, this will be a negotiation for the next 30 days. But I wanted the 15 in order to get to 20.”

Using impressive numbers, Forbes pointed out, is essential to Trump’s reflexive habit of establishing hierarchy.

“So GDP last quarter was 3.1%,” he said. “Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.”

Asked to comment on soaring US stock indexes, which are up as much as 20% since the start of his term, Trump said the real number was 25%.

“Since election day it’s 25%,” he said. “It has gone up since election day $5.2tn – $5.2tn. If Hillary Clinton would have won, the markets would have gone down substantially.”

Or was it racism and racial resentment?

Over at the Washington Post, researchers Matthew Fowler, Vladimir Medenica, and Cathy Cohen have published the results of a new survey on these questions, with a focus on the 41 percent of white millennials who voted for Trump and the sense of “white vulnerability” that motivated them. The conclusion is very clear:

Contrary to what some have suggested, white millennial Trump voters were not in more economically precarious situations than non-Trump voters. Fully 86 percent of them reported being employed, a rate similar to non-Trump voters; and they were 14 percent less likely to be low income than white voters who did not support Trump. Employment and income were not significantly related to that sense of white vulnerability. So what was? Racial resentment. Even when controlling for partisanship, ideology, region and a host of other factors, white millennials fit Michael Tesler’s analysis, explored here. As he put it, economic anxiety isn’t driving racial resentment; rather, racial resentment is driving economic anxiety. We found, as he has in a larger population, that racial resentment is the biggest predictor of white vulnerability among white millennials. Economic variables like education, income and employment made a negligible difference.

The survey looked at millennials because they will be the largest share of the voting-eligible population in 2018, so they’re an important bellwether for future trends. (At the same time, most millennials backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, not Trump.)

To anyone who’s been following the research on this, the findings should come as little surprise. There have now been numerous studies that found support for Trump is closely linked to racial resentment, defined by Fowler, Medenica, and Cohen as “a moral feeling that blacks violate such traditional American values as individualism and self-reliance.”

This is crucial to understanding both Trump’s rise and how to overcome Trump. As a presidential candidate, Trump made all sorts of racist comments — suggesting that Mexican immigrants are criminals and rapists, proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the US, saying a US judge should recuse himself from a case simply because of his Mexican heritage, and deploying dog whistles about “law and order.”

As president, Trump equated a group of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and white nationalists who descended onto Charlottesville, Virginia, with the anti-racism protesters who stood against bigotry. His administration has also pursued policies that will disproportionately hurt minority groups, including his travel ban, immigration restrictions, “tough on crime” policies, and potential voting restrictions.

The studies suggest that these kinds of comments and actions are not just incidental to Trump; they are at the core of his political success. If Democrats want to defeat him, they will need to overcome that racial resentment.

The latest findings are backed by many other studies

This is not a one-off finding. At this point, the evidence that Trump’s rise was driven by racism and racial resentment is fairly stacked.

One paper, published in January by political scientists Brian Schaffner, Matthew MacWilliams, and Tatishe Nteta, found that voters’ measures of sexism and racism correlated much more closely with support for Trump than economic dissatisfaction after controlling for factors like partisanship and political ideology.

Another study, conducted by researchers Brenda Major, Alison Blodorn, and Gregory Major Blascovich shortly before the election, found that if people who strongly identified as white were told that nonwhite groups will outnumber white people in 2042, they became more likely to support Trump.

And a study, published in November by researchers Matthew Luttig, Christopher Federico, and Howard Lavine, found that Trump supporters were much more likely to change their views on housing policy based on race. In this study, respondents were randomly assigned “a subtle image of either a black or a white man.” Then, they were asked about views on housing policy.

The researchers found that Trump supporters were much more likely to be impacted by the image of a black man. After the exposure, they were not only less supportive of housing assistance programs, but they also expressed higher levels of anger that some people receive government assistance and were more likely to say that individuals who receive assistance are to blame for their situation.

In contrast, favorability toward Hillary Clinton did not significantly change respondents’ views on any of these issues when primed with racial cues.

“These findings indicate that responses to the racial cue varied as a function of feelings about Donald Trump — but not feelings about Hillary Clinton — during the 2016 presidential election,” the researchers concluded.

There is also a lot of other research showing that people’s racial attitudes can change their views on politics and policy, as my colleague Dylan Matthews as well as researchers Sean McElwee and Jason McDaniel previously explained for Vox.

Simply put, racial attitudes were a big driver behind Trump’s election — just as they long have been for general beliefs about politics and policy.

To confront Trump, opponents will need to confront racism

At some point, you might start to wonder why journalists keep writing about the link between Trump’s support and bigoted beliefs. The election is over. Do we really need to analyze what happened over and over again?

The point, at least for me, is not to demonize Trump voters. The point is to understand them in order to better grasp what motivated them to vote for someone who ran a clearly bigoted campaign and who most voters agreed is unqualified for the nation’s highest office.

As Schaffner, MacWilliams, and Nteta wrote in their paper, there’s growing evidence that 2016 was unique — in that racism and sexism played a more powerful role than in recent presidential elections. “Specifically, we find no statistically significant relationship between either the racism or sexism scales and favorability ratings of either [previous Republican candidates] John McCain or Mitt Romney,” they wrote. “However, the pattern is quite strong for favorability ratings of Donald Trump.”

The concern, then, is that this is the beginning of a modern trend in which politicians like Trump directly and explicitly play to people’s prejudices to win elections — and it works. This is in many ways an outgrowth of the Southern Strategy and tactics that play into people’s racism, like dog whistles — only it’s more explicit in its bigotry.

If that’s really what’s happening, it’s important for anyone interested in limiting the power of bigotry in US politics to know and demonstrate what’s going on. Studies like this put a bigger imperative on getting to the root of the problem and figuring out ways to reduce people’s racial biases.

To this end, the research also shows it’s possible to reach out to Trump voters — even those who are racist today — in an empathetic way without condoning their prejudice. The evidence suggests, in fact, that the best way to weaken people’s racial or other biases is through frank, empathetic dialogue. (Much more on that in my in-depth piece on the research.) Given that, the strongest approach to really combating racism and racial resentment may be empathy.

One study, for example, found that canvassing people’s homes and having a 10-minute, nonconfrontational conversation about transgender rights — in which people’s lived experiences were relayed so they could understand how prejudice feels personally — managed to reduce voters’ anti-trans attitudes for at least three months. Perhaps a similar model could be adapted to reach out to people with racist, sexist, or other deplorable views, although this possibility needs more study.

But all of this involves a lot of legwork, outreach, and a kind of empathy that people may not be comfortable with in an era of highly polarized politics. Knowing what caused Trump’s win is crucial to gauging whether all of this work and effort is worth doing — and the growing body of evidence suggests that it truly is."

The announcement was made Wednesday during a speech before UAW member gathered in a repurposed airplane hangar at the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti, west of Detroit.

""The era for the economic surrender for the United States is over, it's over,"" Trump told the crowd at the crowd at the site, which produced B-24 bombers during World War II and is being converted into an automotive testing and product development facility.

""My administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations, to lower the job-crushing taxes and to ensure a level playing field for all American companies and workers,"" Trump explained.

He said fewer regulations will mean more jobs in the auto industry, adding there will be ""consequences"" for American companies that ship jobs elsewhere.

""...The assault on the American auto industry is over, believe me, it's over,"" the president said.

The fuel economy requirements Trump referenced were a centerpiece of President Barack Obama's strategy to combat global warming. But Trump appears to be making good on a pledge to car company CEOs to reduce what he sees as impediments to good business.

Here's a breakdown:

___

WHAT ARE CAFE AND GHG STANDARDS?

CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards are mile-per-gallon targets for cars and trucks set by the U.S. government. The standards are based on size and are weighted by sales. Each manufacturer has a different requirement based on the models it sells.

Congress required the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop CAFE standards in 1975 after gasoline shortages during the Arab oil embargo. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in 2007. The agencies work together to produce CAFE standards.

The standard for passenger cars stayed at 27.5 mpg from 1990 until 2007. In 2009, the government set a fuel economy standard of 34.1 mpg for cars and light trucks by 2016. In 2012, it set a new target of 54.5 mpg by 2025. The number can change depending on the mix of vehicles customers buy. Right now, it stands at 51.4 mpg because people are buying more SUVs and trucks.

___

UNDER THE CURRENT STANDARD, WOULD MY CAR GET 54.5 MPG IN 2025?

No. Manufacturers can apply credits for various fuel-saving technologies to arrive at that figure. Real-world mileage would be closer to 36 mpg.

___

WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

In the last days of the Obama administration, the EPA completed a review of the standards for model years 2022-2025 and left them unchanged, saying the car companies have many affordable options to help them comply. The industry protested, saying the review was too hasty and didn't consider the fact that gas prices have fallen and few consumers want the smallest, most fuel-efficient vehicles.

President Trump is reopening the evaluation process, which could lead to weaker standards.

___

WHY WOULD THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDER CHANGING THE STANDARDS?

President Trump wants automakers to expand production in the U.S. and hire more workers. In exchange, he has promised to cut regulations and taxes. Gasoline is more than $1 per gallon cheaper than it was in 2012, when the standards were issued. The low prices hurt demand for more fuel-efficient cars. If those cars don't sell, their high mileage can't be counted toward an automaker's corporate average fuel economy.

But environmental groups say weakening the standards would increase pollution and require consumers to spend more on gas.

___

HOW ARE AUTOMAKERS IMPROVING THEIR FUEL ECONOMY?

Manufacturers have introduced all-electric cars like the Chevrolet Bolt and increased the use of lightweight materials like aluminum. Engine technologies, such as direct fuel injection, and more efficient transmissions are also contributing. The standards give manufacturers extra credit for new technologies, such as hybrid engines for pickup trucks and stop-start systems, which automatically shut off the engine when the vehicle stops in traffic.

___

DO THOSE ADDED TECHNOLOGIES MAKE MY VEHICLE MORE EXPENSIVE?

Yes. In its final ruling in January, the EPA estimated the fuel economy standards will cost $875 per vehicle. A study commissioned by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers estimates the cost of compliance at $1,249 per vehicle. However, the EPA says the standards would save consumers up to $1,620 in gas over the life of their vehicle.

___

IF THE STANDARDS ARE WEAKENED, WILL THAT AFFECT WHAT KINDS OF CARS ARE AVAILABLE?

Maybe. Automakers might choose to offer fewer electric or hybrid cars in the U.S., since those are less profitable than trucks and SUVs. They also could scrap subcompact cars, which are unpopular with U.S. consumers but help meet fuel economy targets.

There are caveats. Automakers will still have to meet rising fuel economy standards in China and Europe, so they won't stop making efficient vehicles. If gas prices rise, U.S. consumers might demand more fuel-efficient cars. Finally, California and other blue states have a history of passing stricter standards than the rest of the country. If that continues, automakers would have to keep their most fuel-efficient models in U.S. showrooms, since California is the biggest market in the U.S.

Also Wednesday, Trump teased another ""big"" upcoming announcement regarding automakers, but offered no details.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Riedel/AP Charlie Riedel/AP

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback is notorious for what is known as the Kansas experiment, a bold effort to assert the power of limited government.

In 2012, the Republican governor pushed reforms through the state Legislature that dramatically cut income taxes across the board. Brownback boasted the plan would deliver a ""shot of adrenaline"" to the Kansas economy.

But the opposite happened.

Revenues shrank, and the economy grew more slowly than in neighboring states and the country as a whole. Kansas' bond rating plummeted, and the state cut funding to education and infrastructure.

Last year, the Republican-controlled state Legislature voted to roll back the tax cuts, but Kansas is still dealing with the aftermath of this bold experiment. State lawmakers are now seeking to close a $900 million budget gap over the next two years.

Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at the University of Kansas, says the experiment was as much a political play as it was about governing.

""My personal thought here is that Brownback came back to Kansas from the [U.S.] Senate to demonstrate that Kansas could be this small government heaven on Earth, that would help him honestly run for president in 2012,"" Loomis says.

When Brownback was elected in 2010, Kansas, like many other states, was still struggling to rebound after the Great Recession.

""Well, Kansas for years had been thought of as being somewhat behind other states in the region in terms of growth,"" says Kenneth Kriz, a professor of public finance at Wichita State University. ""There was a push starting really with the first years of the Brownback administration to do something with tax policy to help turn the tide and to make Kansas more attractive as a place to live and do business.""

Brownback promised the tax cuts would lead to an extra 22,000 jobs over the next five years. It also reduced the number of tax brackets for individual income from three to two.

A key part of the plan slashed to zero the tax rate pass-through businesses pay. Small businesses — such as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations — pay taxes through the individual income tax code, not the corporate one. Under the Kansas plan, the pass-through tax rate was reduced from 7 percent to zero.

Kriz says big companies exploited this tax exemption.

""There were a lot of really big companies that were actually [limited liability] like big law firms in this state, oil exploration companies then,"" he says.

Others supposedly lied on their tax forms.

""Most famously, a couple of basketball coaches allegedly — although nobody can ever prove this — were alleged to have retitled themselves as independent contractors in order to be able to take advantage of it for their multimillion-dollar incomes,"" Kriz says.

The theory of the plan — supply-side or trickle-down economics — is a divisive one. For decades, Republicans have touted the economic theory, which seeks to create growth through lowering taxes and decreasing regulation.

""Any serious model tells you that economic growth always leads to increases in revenues, not reductions in revenue,"" says Arthur Laffer, an economist who advised President Ronald Reagan and the Trump campaign, among others. He helped create the Kansas tax plan and is considered by many to be the father of supply-side economics.

But when the tax cuts went into effect in 2014, their failure was seen almost instantly. State revenues plummeted by almost $700 million, Kriz says.

""To put it in context, the state general fund budget is about $6 billion, and so that's 10 percent revenue loss in one year,"" he says. ""That's a lot for any government to have to make [up].""

State lawmakers tried to balance the budget by tapping into reserves and the highway fund. They put construction projects on hold; pension contributions dropped; and Medicaid was cut.

The state also refashioned the school funding formula and closed and consolidated several school districts. School funding consumes about half of Kansas' budget.

Loomis says the Kansas experiment occurred after a shift in the state Legislature.

Since the 1970s, the state government had been moderately conservative and ""pretty much reflected the nature of Kansans,"" he says. Then during the Tea Party wave in 2010 — when hundreds of congressional and state government seats were won by Republicans — the Kansas Legislature moved further right. Brownback, who had served 14 years in the U.S. Senate, was also elected as governor.

Because of the state's deficit problems, Brownback did not run for president in 2012, and he barely won re-election in 2014. Republicans in the Legislature voted to overturn his tax cuts with the support of Democrats, who helped override the governor's veto.

The 2016 election saw the Kansas Legislature grow more moderate again, Loomis says.

""So you had moderate Republicans who made a resurgence in 2016,"" he says. ""You had Democrats who did well in 2016, but the last few votes in both the Senate and House were really quite conservative Republicans who just sucked that up and said, 'We really need to have revenues or this state is going to be in huge, huge difficulties.' ""

Despite the $1.2 billion tax increase that passed last year, the budget mess is far from over. Brownback has been nominated to serve in the Trump administration, and once he is confirmed, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer will finish his term.

While many experts regard the Kansas tax cuts as a failure, Trump's proposed tax plan echoes Brownback's policy, and many Republicans still embrace the ideology behind it.

""There's lots of economic data that lower taxes mean a much better economic growth,"" Colyer tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson. ""I worked for President Ronald Reagan. I saw it firsthand. You know, we see those things on the national level.""

The Trump tax overhaul aims to spur revenue by cutting taxes for American businesses and earners, including the wealthiest Americans. The Senate voted last week to further a budget bill needed to advance the plan.

The corporate tax cuts proposed — the plan would drop rates from 35 to 20 percent — would increase the typical household income by $3,000 to $7,000 a year, according to a report by the Council of Economic Advisers.

But as Washington considers a plan similar to Kansas, Kriz is unconvinced.

""Studies have shown that tax cuts tend to pay anywhere between 10 percent and 30 percent of their costs,"" he says. ""So if we cut taxes by a trillion dollars, we're going to probably get an extra hundred billion back ... in extra revenues from economic growth. But that still leaves $700 [billion] to $900 billion in cuts that will have to be made. Those cuts also have an economic effect in drawing down the economy."""

Not so long ago, however, Trump's view of the monthly jobs report, which comes courtesy of the nonpartisan federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, was markedly different. As recently as December, he described the report as “totally fiction.”

If there was any argument over whether Trump was flip-flopping on the jobs report at the precise moment it reflected positively on him, White House press secretary Sean Spicer laid it to rest Friday afternoon, telling reporters: “I talked to the president prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly: 'They may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now.' ”

Let's take a walk down memory lane and remember a few times Trump trashed the jobs numbers as “fake,” incomplete or something other than the right way to determine whether America had been made “great again.”

Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup. Today’s theme song: “Let the River Run” from the television show “Working Girl.”

Poll of the week

President Trump continues to be the least popular president this far into his presidency. With a net approval rating of -18 percentage points, Trump easily outpaces former President Gerald Ford, who previously held the record low (-9 points). But here’s what makes Trump’s poor rating extra unusual: People think the economy is in pretty good shape.

Trump’s net job approval rating on the economy specifically — pollsters typically ask whether a respondent approves of “how Trump is handling the economy” — tends to be significantly higher than his overall rating. In the latest Quinnipiac University survey, for example, Trump sports an -18 percentage point net approval rating overall and a +2 point rating on the economy.

That’s a huuuuuuge split.

As you can see in the chart below, Trump’s overall net approval rating is far below where we would expect it to be if the usual relationship between economic and overall approval ratings held for him.

Instead of a net job approval rating of -18 percentage points, Trump’s would be projected to be about +12 percentage points.

Every president since Jimmy Carter had a higher overall net job approval rating than economic approval rating in October of the first term. For example, President Obama averaged a net job approval rating of +11, according to FiveThirtyEight’s approval tracker, and an economic net approval rating of +4. On average, presidents have had a net overall rating 14 points above their economic rating. Trump’s is closer to 20 points below his economic rating.

The sample size of previous presidents here is pretty small at just six, so we shouldn’t read too much into the exact projection of what we’d expect Trump’s overall job approval rating to be in comparison to his economic rating. Additionally, Trump’s background as a businessman may give him a boost in economic job approval ratings that previous presidents didn’t get. Still, it does seem that Trump’s popularity is vastly lower than we would expect given how Americans view him on the economy.

It’ll be interesting to see how this unusual split relates to upcoming elections. If Republicans hold their own in the 2018 midterms, it could be because voters are casting their ballots based on how they feel about Trump’s performance on the economy. It’s also possible that Trump’s overall approval rating will improve to match his economic approval rating as voters tune in before the midterms. If Trump’s overall approval ratings remain low and Republicans lose a lot of seats in the midterms, however, it will be in spite of what they see as a decent economy.

Other polling nuggets

Trump’s job approval rating

Trump’s job approval rating has fallen to 37.9 percent, while his disapproval rating has risen to 56 percent. Those are slightly worse than last week, when his approval rating was at 38.8 percent and his disapproval rating was at 55.6 percent.

The generic ballot

Democrats lead the Republicans 46.6 percent to 39 percent on the generic congressional ballot. That’s basically unchanged from last week."

The legislation, which the GOP aims to muscle through Congress next week, would lower taxes on the richest Americans. Benefits for most other taxpayers would be smaller, but Trump attempted to sell the bill as a “Christmas present” for middle-class Americans in part because it would trigger job growth.



“It’ll be fantastic for the middle-income people and for jobs, most of all,” Trump told reporters on the White House lawn before traveling to Camp David. “And I will say that because of what we’ve done with regulation and other things our economy is doing fantastically well, but it has another big step to go and it can’t take that step unless we do the tax bill.”

Trump also predicted the legislation would cause the economy to soar beyond its current 3% rate of growth.

“I think we could go to 4%, 5% or even 6%, ultimately,” the president said. “We are back. We are really going to start to rock.”

Many economists believe that attaining consistent 4% or 5% annual growth would be challenging. The nation last topped 5% growth in 1984.

The Republican plan is the widest-ranging reshaping of the tax code in three decades and is expected to add to the nation’s $20tn debt by $1.46tn over a decade.

Under the bill, today’s 35% rate on corporations would fall to 21%, the crown jewel of the measure for many Republicans. Trump and GOP leaders had set 20% as their goal but added a point to free money for other tax cuts that won over wavering lawmakers in final talks.

“This is happening,” House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told rank-and-file members in a conference call Friday. “Tax reform under Republican control of Washington is happening. Most critics out there didn’t think it could happen … and now we’re on the doorstep of something truly historic.”

The bill would repeal an important part of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act – the requirement that all Americans have health insurance or face a penalty – as the GOP looks to unravel a law it failed to repeal and replace this past summer. It came together as Republicans cemented the needed support for the overhaul, securing endorsements from wavering senators.

Marco Rubio of Florida relented in his high-profile opposition after negotiators expanded the tax credit that parents can claim for their children. He said he would vote for the measure next week.

Bob Corker of Tennessee, the only Republican to vote against the Senate version earlier this month, made the surprise announcement that he would back the legislation. Corker has repeatedly warned that the nation’s growing debt is the most serious threat to national security.

“I realize this is a bet on our country’s enterprising spirit, and that is a bet I am willing to make,” Corker said.

The bill embodies a long-standing Republican philosophy that a substantial tax break for businesses will trigger economic growth and job creation in a trickle-down economy. Democrats are likely to oppose the legislation unanimously.

“Under this bill, the working class, middle class and upper middle class get skewered while the rich and wealthy corporations make out like bandits,” said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York. “It is just the opposite of what America needs, and Republicans will rue the day they pass this.”

The bill would drop today’s 39.6% top rate on individuals to 37%. The standard deduction – used by around two-thirds of households – would be nearly doubled, to $24,000 for married couples.

The $1,000-per-child tax deduction would grow to $2,000, with up to $1,400 available in Internal Revenue Service refunds for families who owe little or no taxes. Parents would have to provide children’s Social Security numbers to receive the child tax credit, a measure intended to deny the credit to people who are in the US illegally.

Those who itemize would lose some deductions. The deduction that millions use in connection with state and local income, property and sales taxes would be capped at $10,000. That is especially important to residents of high-tax – and Democratic-voting – states such as New York, New Jersey and California. Deductions for medical expenses that lawmakers once considered eliminating would be retained.

The bill would allow homeowners to deduct interest only on the first $750,000 of a new mortgage, down from the current limit of $1m.

People who inherit fortunes would get a big break. The bill would double the exemption, meaning the estate tax would apply only to the portion of an estate over $22m for married couples.

Members of a House-Senate conference committee signed the final version of the legislation on Friday, sending it to the two chambers for final passage next week.

Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, and two ailing GOP senators missed votes this past week.



John McCain of Arizona, who is 81, is at a Washington-area military hospital being treated for the side effects of brain cancer treatment. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, 80, had a non-melanoma lesion removed from his nose earlier this week. GOP leaders are hopeful they will be available next week."
365,Can President Trump bring back manufacturing jobs? - PBS NewsHour,Can President Trump bring back manufacturing jobs?

The blue-collar community on the shores of Lake Erie had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. For decades, labor unions endorsed Democratic candidates and their members voted in step.

But the landscape in Erie was changing. Well-paying manufacturing jobs that once sustained families in the region were disappearing. Residents were leaving in search of better economic prospects.

General Electric Transportation, once Erie’s largest employer, began the election year by shedding 1,500 of the 4,500 jobs at its locomotive plant that paid, on average, a comfortable $34 an hour. Over the past three years, the company had gradually shifted production to a non-union facility in Fort Worth, Texas in an effort to minimize costs and keep up with global competition.

Erie, along with dozens of other manufacturing hubs along the Rust Belt, have seen seismic shifts as technology has quenched the demand for manual labor on factory floors. Companies like GE that once sustained the region have either cut jobs, or closed entirely, in recent years. Since 1990, Erie County has lost 16,000 manufacturing jobs, representing 44 percent of the industry there. In the year leading up to the election, unemployment in Erie rose from 5 percent to 7 percent.

The anxiety and excitement was palatable at the ice hockey arena when Trump took the stage in Erie. His calls to lower taxes and punish companies from leaving the United States were greeted with thunderous cheers. Bucking conventional wisdom about America’s economy, Trump promised to renegotiate trade deals and “bring back” jobs that many economists say have been lost to automation.

“Erie has lost a lot, right?” Trump said. “Hang in, don’t leave. I promise we can fix it so fast. We will stop these countries from taking our jobs. We will stop these countries from taking our companies.”

On Election Day, Trump defied expectations in Erie, taking a county that Barack Obama won by more than 19,000 votes in 2012, and winning it by around 2,000 votes. His victory in Pennsylvania was the first by a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. Trump also won other traditionally Democratic states like Michigan and Wisconsin, propelled by voters from similar counties throughout the industrial heartland.

Trump’s message resonated with small business owners like Joe and Sondralee Orengia. A champion power lifter, Joe manages Joe’s Gym, while Sondralee operates Custom Audio, an electronics store. Both say they have seen fewer customers in recent years, and are excited about Trump’s promise to return manufacturing jobs and revitalize the Erie economy.

“The Democratic Party’s so strong here and then you get someone like Donald Trump who is really a very different candidate. I mean, we’ve never seen anything like him before,” Sondralee said. “I think a lot of people are fearful, especially the Democrats, but I think the people who voted for him, they’re hopeful.”

Joe Orengia voted for Democratic candidates in the past, but registered as a Republican for the first time after reading Trump’s book, “Crippled America: How to Make Our Country Great Again.” He showed his support by designing and selling “Pump for Trump” T-shirts that proudly displayed Trump’s face superimposed onto a cartoon power lifter.

Orengia, who is 70 years old, grew up in the 1950s during the heyday of manufacturing, when more than half of Erie workers were employed in factories. After apprentice school, he worked as an ironworker and helped construct factory buildings for companies like GE and Hammermill Paper Company.

“I was one of their best climbers,” he said. “I always got the job of putting the buildings together, which was fun. You climb up the column, a big piece of steel comes up, you bolt it up, you walk out, unhook the cable and stand there and wait for the next piece.”

Hammermill, which was bought by International Paper Company, shut its Erie factory in 2002. Many buildings that Orengia helped to build have been torn down.

“They were some of the best years of my life working down there, putting them up. They are gone and the people are gone,” he said.

Bringing Back Jobs

With Trump now in office, Orengia is hopeful for a revival in Erie. After the election, he watched as Trump struck a deal with Carrier, an air-conditioner manufacturer, to prevent around 800 of 1,400 jobs at an Indiana plant from moving to Mexico. Critics, however, say the one-off deal granting Carrier millions in tax breaks to preserve jobs in the U.S. does not make economic sense. Trump has also promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and impose tariffs on Chinese imports. In his first week in office, he signed an executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Despite the president’s promise to bring jobs back to the United States, technology has caused massive upheaval in the manufacturing industry. Labor-intensive manufacturing is rapidly disappearing from communities like Erie and economists say traditional factory jobs are not coming back.

The number of manufacturing jobs in Erie reached its peak in 1950 when almost 50,000 people were employed in the industry, according to government data analyzed by Kenneth Louie, the director of the Economic Research Institute of Erie at Penn State University.

Manufacturing thrived in Erie through the 1960s, but then starting in 1975, jobs began to disappear. Losses accelerated during the recession in the early 2000s, as well as during the 2008 financial crisis. Now, around 20,000 manufacturing jobs are left in Erie.

Many of those jobs have been replaced by jobs in the service sector that don’t pay as well, according to Louie.

“The loss of manufacturing jobs really isn’t just the loss of jobs but the loss of good paying jobs,” he said.

There are exceptions to the rule. Some service sector jobs, such as those in health care and education, can pay more than manufacturing.

Economists say that automation is by far the biggest factor behind the decline in manufacturing jobs across the country. Technological advances mean that fewer factory workers are required to maintain the same level of output.

Since 2001, roughly one-in-three manufacturing jobs have been lost in Erie, but manufacturing output has remained relatively steady. Manufacturing represented 28 percent of Erie’s GDP in 2001. In 2015, it was 26 percent.

This pattern holds true across the country, according to Mark Muro, the director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institute. Today, it only takes six workers to generate $1 million in manufacturing output, says Muro. The same level of output would have required 25 workers in 1980.

“Trump deserves credit for taking seriously the anxieties and anger and frustrations in these communities,” Muro said. But his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and bring back millions of jobs is a “pipe dream,” Muro added, as modern, high-value manufacturing requires fewer workers.

Some leaders in Erie are betting on advanced manufacturing to be the future of the local economy. They point to seemingly abandoned factory buildings along Erie’s 12th street industrial corridor that are home to high-tech manufacturing equipment. However, these jobs often require a college degree, shutting out many former factory workers. Incomes in Erie, as a result, have not kept pace with the rest of the country.

U.S. trade with China in the last 15 years has also cost manufacturing jobs in communities like Erie. China, with its steady supply of low-wage workers, can produce labor-intensive goods at a much lower cost.

David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says trade with China has improved the standard of living for many Americans — but not every community has benefitted equally.

“People with a college education have by and large benefitted. They get lower priced goods and services and they are not in competition for work,” Autor said.

Manufacturing communities like Erie, however, have borne the brunt of the negative consequences of trade, according to Autor’s research. In a paper published a week after the election, Autor noted that swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin would have elected Hillary Clinton instead of Trump if the effects of Chinese imports had been reduced by 50 percent.

“People aren’t just blaming the boogeyman for the challenges that they face without any justification,” Autor said. “Globalization actually was a big deal.”

Competition from abroad, Muro noted, is just a part of the challenge facing communities like Erie. GE’s move to a non-union factory in Texas, he said, also demonstrates the “constant drive” among companies to reduce costs and increase productivity. The Trump administration has not spoken out against companies that shift jobs to other parts of the U.S. in search of cheaper, non-union labor.

A spokesperson from GE Transportation says the company has seen fewer locomotive orders from North American companies in recent years. GE has culled jobs in Erie to become more cost-effective and competitive in the global market. The company insists it is committed to its Erie plant, which recently designed and built locomotives that were shipped to Angola and Pakistan.

Such challenges, aside, Joe Orengia is still hopeful about the promises Trump has made. “I’ve got to give him a chance,” he said. If things get “even just a little bit better” by 2020, Orengia will vote for him again. ”If things get worse, no,” he said.

Story Highlights Weekly average for week ending March 5 stood at +16

Current conditions component score at record monthly high

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Many Americans either gained or regained economic optimism last week, as Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index soared seven points to hit +16. This marks the highest weekly average in Gallup's nine-year trend. The index has recovered the ground it lost over the week of Jan. 30-Feb. 5, when it fell from the previous record high of +14 to +8 and languished at that lower level for the next three weeks.

Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index is the average of two components: how Americans rate current economic conditions and whether they feel the economy is improving or getting worse. The index has a theoretical maximum of +100 if all Americans were to say the economy is doing well and improving, and a theoretical minimum of -100 if all Americans were to say the economy is doing poorly and getting worse.

Last week was an eventful one for the U.S. economy. President Donald Trump gave his maiden address to Congress on Feb. 28, emphasizing his key economic policy goals such as lowering the corporate tax rate. Those who watched the speech were generally pleased with it, and traders on Wall Street were decidedly upbeat: Stock markets rallied on Wednesday, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 21,000 for the first time in its history. Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen also spoke favorably of current economic conditions in a speech on Friday.

It is impossible to know which of these events played the most important role in boosting Americans' confidence last week, though it seems unlikely that Yellen's remarks influenced the public much given her low name recognition. Trump, meanwhile, commanded a large national audience, and his speech likely helped spark the stock market's record-setting performance the next day.

Curiously, though, it was Democrats who showed the largest improvement in economic confidence from Wednesday to Sunday of last week, the period after Trump's speech and the stock market rally. Over the seven days leading up these two events (Feb. 22-28), Democrats registered an index score of -7; for the five-day period of March 1-5, their score rose to 0. Republicans, on the other hand, showed modest gains; their index score rose from +45 to +48 in the same time frame.

As Democrats, by and large, disapprove of Trump's job performance as president, this would seem to suggest that other factors, such as the stock market rally, may have helped shape economic attitudes last week.

Americans' Monthly Ratings of Current Economic Conditions at Record High

For the month of February, Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index averaged +8, three points below January's record-setting score.

In February, one-third of U.S. adults (33%) described economic conditions as ""excellent"" or ""good,"" while 20% rated them as ""poor."" This resulted in a current conditions score of +13 for the month -- a three-point increase from January's score and a nine-year high for this component.

Opinions about the future trajectory of the economy, however, soured last month. Less than half of U.S. adults (48%) said economic conditions were ""getting better,"" while nearly as many (45%) said they were getting worse -- yielding a score of +3 for the economic outlook component. In January, the economic outlook component averaged +11.

Bottom Line

Though confidence in the economy appeared to stall in the month of February after rising steadily throughout the past three months, it may have gained a second wind last week after Trump's speech to Congress and the stock market's strong performance.

The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 7-12 among 1,503 adults, finds that Trump’s overall job approval is much lower than those of prior presidents in their first weeks in office: 39% approve of his job performance, while 56% disapprove.

The intensity of the public’s early views of Trump is striking: Fully 75% either approve or disapprove of Trump strongly, compared with just 17% who feel less strongly. Nearly half (46%) strongly disapprove of his job performance, while 29% strongly approve.

This level of strong disapproval already surpasses strong disapproval for Barack Obama at any point during the eight years of his presidency. The only occasion when strong disapproval of George W. Bush was higher than for Trump currently was in December 2008, near the end of his presidency.

And while all presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan initially attracted at least modest support from the opposing party, Trump gets almost none. Just 8% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents approve of his job performance – by far the lowest rating for any new president from the opposing party in more than three decades. By contrast, 84% of Republicans and Republican leaners approve of the way he is handling his job as president, which is in line with the support past presidents received from their own parties. For more, see detailed demographic tables on Trump job approval.

Opinion about Trump’s highest profile policy proposal to date – his executive order limiting entry to the U.S. by refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries – is similar to his overall job approval. About four-in-ten (38%) approve of this policy, while 59% disapprove.

The public has a more critical view of how this executive order, which has been blocked by the courts, was implemented. Just 28% say that, regardless of their view of the policy, they believe the administration did an excellent or good job of communicating the order and putting it into effect. While 17% say the administration did only a fair job of implementing the policy, 53% say it did a poor job in this regard.

Even Republicans, who overwhelmingly approve of Trump’s job performance and the policy behind the executive order, have mixed views about the way it was carried out. While 54% say the administration did an excellent or good job of putting the order into effect, 44% say it did only fair or poor.

The survey finds that the public gives positive marks to Trump on keeping his promises (60% say he does this) and his ability to get things done (54%). However, on seven other traits and characteristics – ranging from his temperament to whether he is a good manager – he is viewed more negatively.

Just 28% of Americans say Trump is “even-tempered,” while more than twice as many (68%) say this phrase does not describe him.

Trump’s ratings on the traits for which trends are available are lower than they were for Barack Obama, Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. At similar points in their presidencies, majorities said Obama (76%), Bush (60%) and Clinton (63%) were trustworthy. Currently, just 37% view Trump as trustworthy.

While 39% say Trump is “well-informed,” nearly twice as many said that description applied to Obama in February 2009 (79%) and Clinton in January 1993 (also 79%). In early 2001, 62% said Bush was well-informed.

Trump fares better relative to past presidents in views of his ability to get things done. While 54% say this description applies to Trump, only somewhat more (60%) said it described Bush in 2001. In February 2009, 70% said Obama could get things done.

Other important findings

Improved views among Republicans help lift economic ratings. The public’s views of the nation’s economy – both current and future conditions – continue to be relatively positive. Currently, 42% rate economic conditions as excellent or good, up 11 percentage points since December. The share of Republicans who take a positive view of economic conditions has nearly tripled since then, from 14% to 40%, while holding more stable among Democrats. As in December, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to expect economic conditions to improve (75% vs. 14%).

Most continue to say Trump has little or no respect for democratic institutions. As was the case in October, during the campaign, a majority of Americans (59%) say Trump has not too much (25%) or no respect at all (34%) for the nation’s democratic institutions and traditions; 40% say he has a great deal (18%) or fair amount (22%) of respect for democratic institutions.

Racial, ethnic diversity viewed more positively. Currently, 64% say having an increasing number of people from different races and ethnic groups makes the country a better place to live, up from 56% in August. About three-quarters of Democrats (76%) and 51% of Republicans think the nation’s growing diversity makes it a better place to live."
369,President Trump signs order to withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership - The Washington Post,President Trump signs order to withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership  The Washington Post,"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvbmsvd3AvMjAxNy8wMS8yMy9wcmVzaWRlbnQtdHJ1bXAtc2lnbnMtb3JkZXItdG8td2l0aGRyYXctZnJvbS10cmFuc3BhY2lmaWMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"President Trump began recasting America’s role in the global economy Monday, canceling an agreement for a sweeping trade deal with Asia that he once called a “potential disaster.” Trump signed the executive order formally ending the United States’ participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the Oval Office after discussing American manufacturing with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room. The order was largely symbolic — the deal was already essentially dead in Congress — but served to signal that Trump’s tough talk on trade during the campaign will carry over to his new administration.

Trump did not directly address the North American Free Trade Agreement on Monday as he had promised during the election. However, he repeated his threat to punish U.S. companies that build factories overseas and ship products back home — a charge he has primarily leveled at automakers with operations in Mexico. And his hard-line opening stance could portend a contentious renegotiation of the 22-year-old deal with Mexico and Canada that Trump’s senior advisers have called a top priority for the new administration.

“This abrupt action so early in the Trump administration puts the world on notice that all of America's traditional economic and political alliances are now open to reassessment and renegotiation,” said Eswar Prasad, trade policy professor at Cornell University. “This could have an adverse long-run impact on the ability of the U.S. to maintain its influence and leadership in world economic and political affairs.”

The TPP was one of former president Barack Obama’s signature efforts, part of a broader strategy to increase American clout in Asia and provide a check on China’s economic and military ambitions. Several of the executives Trump met with Monday initially had supported the agreement, while the chief architect of the administration’s trade policy, Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, was also once a booster for the deal.

But ending TPP was one of the clarion calls of Trump’s campaign, part of a global backlash against the drive toward greater internationalization that has defined the world economy since the end of World War II. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is in the midst of navigating her country’s own break from established trading partners, is slated to visit with Trump later this week. A White House spokesman said meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto are in the works.

“What we want is fair trade,” Trump said during his meeting with executives. “And we're gonna treat countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly.”

Since the election, TPP has become politically toxic in both parties. On Monday, five Democratic senators introduced legislation that would require the president to notify each of the 11 other countries involved in the deal of the United States’ withdrawal. It would also block any so-called “fast track” approval of the agreement in the future. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka hailed the president’s executive order and called for additional action.

“They are just the first in a series of necessary policy changes required to build a fair and just global economy,” he said in a statement.

On Monday, Trump highlighted his proposal for a border tax as a centerpiece of the administration’s trade policy. Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, who was among the business leaders who met with Trump on Monday morning, said the border tax was discussed extensively. He said the executives were asked to return in 30 days with a plan to shore up the manufacturing industry.

“I would take the president at his word here,” Liveris said. “He’s not going to do anything to harm competitiveness. He’s going to actually make us all more competitive.”

Still, it remains unclear exactly how a border tax would be implemented. Testifying before the Senate finance committee last week, Trump’s nominee to lead the Treasury Department said any border tax would be targeted at specific businesses. However, the president does not have the power to levy taxes, and international trade experts have warned singling out companies could violate existing treaties.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has proposed allowing businesses that export goods to deduct many of their expenses, while those that import would not receive the same benefit. But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump dismissed the plan, known as border adjustment, as “too complicated.”

Economists have warned that many of Trump’s proposals — including suggestions that he would impose blanket double-digit tariffs on goods from Mexico and China — could backfire on the American economy by causing prices to rise or igniting a trade war. And business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had lobbied extensively for passage of TPP, touting the deal as an engine of job growth and an important check on China’s growing ambitions.

“TPP withdrawal will slow U.S. [economic] growth, cost American jobs, & weaken U.S. standing in Asia/world,” said Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a tweet early Monday. “China could well be principal beneficiary.”

But other industry groups argued that Trump’s approach would better leverage America’s status as the world’s largest economy. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said his group is hoping that opening up NAFTA could provide more leeway to combat currency manipulation in countries outside the agreement. His group, which represents both industry and unions, is also seeking more stringent rules of origin that dictate how much production must occur with member countries to qualify for free trade status.

“The details are going to matter a lot,” Paul said. “Renegotiating NAFTA obviously entails some risks and some rewards.”"

President Donald Trump has made exactly this claim: that the stock market’s rally was a validation of his decisions.

“We just hit a record, and a number that’s never been hit before,” Trump told ABC News in reference to the Dow hitting 20,000. “So I was very honored by that.”

Viewed correctly, however, the stock market’s “Trump bump” is surprisingly small, which indicates it has a negative view of President Trump’s policies.

The reality is the stock market’s “Trump bump” is surprisingly small, which indicates it has a negative view of President Trump’s policies.

On Nov. 8, 2016, when the world expected Hillary Clinton to win the election, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sat at 18,332. The Trump rally took the U.S. stock market up to over 20,000 on Jan. 25, 2017.

The Trump rally is weak

The stock market has risen close to 10 percent since the election (but has fallen about a percent between Jan. 30 and 31). How is a 10 percent rally a negative statement on President Trump’s policy? The government is going to increase corporate profits almost 15 percent by giving them taxpayer money. The market’s evaluation of the rest of the looming policies (other than corporate tax cuts) is negative 5 percent. Here is the summary:

+15% Value of taking your money and giving it to companies

– 5% Impact of all other Trump policies

—–

+10% Total

The stock market is giving President Trump’s policies, outside of the corporate tax cut, a negative grade. The stock market’s message is clear: Taking your money and giving it to companies through lower taxes is good for the companies and good for the stock market. All the other Trump actions are hurting the U.S. economy and company profits.

In broad strokes, the stock market estimates for every $3 the Trump plans give to companies in taxes, $1 is being destroyed by other actions.

Taking your money and giving it to companies

Any dope can make the stock market rally by picking your pocket.

President Trump is likely to vastly decrease the amount of taxes paid by companies. The immediate impact of cutting taxes is not to create wealth, but rather to take money from future taxpayers and give it to companies. Of course, there might be incentive effects of tax cuts, but those are smaller than the immediate impact of boosting corporate profits.

Tax cuts are free money for companies. Because of the tax cuts, the federal deficit and debt will increase; you, your children and your grandchildren are going to repay these debts.

Any dope can make the stock market rally by picking your pocket.

Officially, large U.S. companies currently face a 35 percent tax rate. However, legal tax avoidance reduces this to an “effective” corporate tax rate of about 25 percent. The stock market would have risen by 14.7 percent if the corporate tax rate were to drop from the current effective rate of 25.9 percent to 15 percent as detailed by the Trump plan.

Is the stock market so smart?

Should we listen to the stock market? Probably not.

The stock market is often crazy. It soared during the early part of President Herbert Hoover’s presidency just before the Great Depression. Similarly, stocks rose relentlessly in 2005, 2006, 2007 just before the housing-related collapse.

The stock market is, like many people on Wall Street, frequently wrong, but never in doubt.

The stock market is, like many people on Wall Street, frequently wrong, but never in doubt.

However, if we, like President Trump, seek to use the stock market to evaluate the economy, that evaluation is currently negative."

After all, long-haul driving, in particular, used to be a pretty good blue-collar job, a ticket to a solid middle-class lifestyle. Back in the 1970s, there was even a network television drama, Movin' On, that chronicled the rollicking roadway adventures of the men piloting the big rigs.

But an updated version of Movin' On would make for a grim and gritty reality show. Industry deregulation and the decline of union power has been good news for consumers, but not for truck drivers as wage earners. Compensation is half of what it once was and turnover is high in what was always a tough, unhealthy job. As such, the truck driving life makes for a decent short-hand illustration of what's gone wrong with working-class America, especially for men.

But in Trump's mind, truck drivers are still postwar America's knights of the road. ""Nothing gets done in America without the hard-working men and women of the trucking industry,"" Trump said. ""When your trucks are moving, America is growing. ... You are our heroes."" He thought he was addressing a potentially receptive audience for a message about how his detail-light tax cut plan would eventually raise their incomes. But he was way off.

The speech was reminiscent of Trump's campaign speech last year near Pittsburgh where he vowed to resurrect the region's once-thriving coal and steel industries. In that speech, Trump oddly failed to note how Pittsburgh was now a leader in the artificial intelligence and robotics industry. With both Google and Uber building research centers there, Pittsburgh's new-economy rebirth should have been a vivid example of how the broader U.S. economy must pivot to the future rather than soak in economic nostalgia. But Trump never mentioned this.

And Trump missed the mark again in Harrisburg. He might have noted that truck drivers are frequently mentioned as some of the workers most at risk from automation. Truck drivers are certainly aware of this. The Teamsters union, which represents some 600,000 people, has been working hard to keep self-driving commercial trucks out of legislation aimed at speeding the deployment of autonomous technology for cars. Union president James Hoffa has said he wants to make sure autonomous technology is ""not used to put workers at risk on the job or destroy livelihoods and chip away at the middle class.""

No politicians should or can make such a guarantee. Technologists and venture capitalists, whether in Detroit or Silicon Valley, think autonomous trucking almost certainly will provide big productivity gains for the U.S. transportation industry and economy overall. Some jobs will be lost, others created, And all the driving jobs won't disappear tomorrow. As technology analyst Benedict Evans has explained, the transition might take 20 or 30 years. By that time ""effectively all current truck drivers will have quit anyway — you won't replace them, but you won't necessarily put anyone directly out of work,"" Evans says. Already, he added, the average trucker is 49 years old, and truckers are leaving the industry faster than they can be replaced.

Government shouldn't protect current jobs from automation. Rather, it should help empower workers to fill the new jobs generated by a dynamic, technologically advanced economy. But Trump and the GOP don't even seem to recognize this as a critical issue. Just same-old, same-old agenda built around deficit-financed tax cuts. And this particular one isn't even structured to be anywhere near optimal for growth. The GOP should be giving as much, if not more, attention to education reform and worker training​ as it does to tax reform​. As economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson recently wrote in Foreign Policy, ""More people need to develop skills that will be complementary to what new machines can do.""

What other choice do we have, really? Even as Trump continues to praise the important jobs of the past century, the economy is movin' on."
373,The U.S. Trade Deficit: How Much Does It Matter? - Council on Foreign Relations,The U.S. Trade Deficit: How Much Does It Matter?  Council on Foreign Relations,"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:12:39 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNmci5vcmcvYmFja2dyb3VuZGVyL3VzLXRyYWRlLWRlZmljaXQtaG93LW11Y2gtZG9lcy1pdC1tYXR0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Council on Foreign Relations,"Introduction

President Donald J. Trump has made reducing the U.S. trade deficit, which has expanded significantly in recent decades, a priority of his administration. He and his advisors argue that renegotiating trade deals, promoting “Buy American” policies, and confronting China over what they see as its economic distortions will shrink the trade deficit, create jobs, and strengthen national security.

Many economists and trade experts do not believe that trade deficits hurt the economy, and warn against trying to “win” the trade relationship with particular countries. Others, however, believe that sustained trade deficits are often a problem, and there is substantial debate over how much of the trade deficit is caused by foreign governments, as well as what policies, if any, should be pursued to reduce it.

What is a trade deficit?

A trade deficit occurs when a nation imports more than it exports. For instance, in 2018 the United States exported $2.500 trillion in goods and services while it imported $3.121 trillion, leaving a trade deficit of $621 billion. Services, such as tourism, intellectual property, and finance, make up roughly one-third of exports, while major goods exported include aircraft, medical equipment, refined petroleum, and agricultural commodities. Meanwhile, imports are dominated by capital goods, such as computers and telecom equipment; consumer goods, such as apparel, electronic devices, and automobiles; and crude oil. (The deficit in goods, at $891 billion, is higher than the overall deficit, since a portion of the goods deficit is offset by the surplus in services trade.)

The balance of imports and exports, or the trade balance, is part of the broader measure of the U.S. economy’s transactions with the rest of the world, known as the balance of payments. The economy’s balance of payments consists of the trade balance, or current account, and the financial accounts, or the measures of U.S. purchase and sales of foreign assets. The financial accounts include financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, as well as foreign direct investment (FDI). These accounts generally balance, since a current account deficit—the trade deficit—results in a corresponding financial account surplus as foreign capital and investment flows into the country.

What causes it?

The fundamental cause of a trade deficit is an imbalance between a country’s savings and investment rates. As Harvard’s Martin Feldstein explains, the reason for the deficit can be boiled down to the United States as a whole spending more money than it makes, which results in a current account deficit. That additional spending must, by definition, go toward foreign goods and services. Financing that spending happens in the form of either borrowing from foreign lenders (which adds to the U.S. national debt) or foreign investing in U.S. assets and businesses—the capital account.

The reason for the deficit can be boiled down to the United States as a whole spending more money than it makes.

As Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Zhiyao Lu of the Peterson Institute for International Economics point out, several forces influence the size of trade deficit:

More government spending, if it leads to a larger federal budget deficit, reduces the national savings rate and raises the trade deficit. A portion of the budget deficit is effectively financed through a rise in the total amount Americans borrow from abroad.

The exchange rate of the dollar is important, as a stronger dollar makes foreign products cheaper for American consumers while making U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers.

A growing U.S. economy also often leads to a larger deficit, since consumers have more income to buy more goods from abroad.

Economists generally see these factors as more important than trade policy in determining the overall deficit. That’s because making it easier or harder to trade with specific countries tends to simply shift the trade deficit to other trading partners. Thus, economists warn against conflating bilateral deficits, which reflect the particular circumstances of trading relationships with specific countries, with the overall deficit, which reflects underlying forces in the economy.

How has the U.S. trade deficit changed over recent decades?

Today’s $621 billion deficit, representing about 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), is down from a 2006 peak of more than $760 billion, which at the time was over 5 percent of GDP. The deficit has averaged $535 billion since 2000, much higher than in previous decades, when it accounted for well below 2 percent of GDP. The United States ran either a surplus or a small deficit through the 1960s and 1970s, after which a large deficit opened in the 1980s and continued to expand through the 1990s and 2000s.

By far the largest bilateral trade imbalance is with China. The United States ran a $419 billion goods deficit with China in 2018. The next largest contributor to the goods deficit, at $151 billion, is the European Union, followed by Mexico at $81.5 billion, Japan at $67.6 billion, and Malaysia at $26.5 billion.

The deficit with China expanded dramatically beginning in the early 2000s from an average of $34 billion in the 1990s. Some economists refer to this as the “China Shock” [PDF] and attribute it to the unexpectedly rapid growth of China’s export manufacturing sector in the late 1990s. This happened as Beijing undertook deep economic reforms and implemented policies to subsidize production, accelerate industrialization, and boost exports. In the process China earned the moniker “the world’s factory.” Economists also note the acceleration of Chinese export growth after the country’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.

These factors meant a rising flow of Chinese electronics, apparel, and other goods into the United States, which helps to explain China’s contribution to the deficit, as well as the deficit’s concentration in the manufacturing sector. U.S. manufacturing employment dropped from 26 percent of the workforce in 1970 to 8.5 percent in 2016, a fall that Hufbauer and others say was accelerated by Chinese competition. However, most economists attribute the bulk of the reduction to automation, productivity increases, and demand shifts from goods to services.

Why are some observers concerned about the trade deficit?

President Trump, who campaigned on ending trade imbalances, argues that “trade deficits hurt the economy very badly.” He blames “horrible deals” with Mexico, South Korea, and other countries for allowing too many cheap foreign imports that have put American factories out of operation and “destroyed jobs.”

Peter Navarro, a senior advisor to the president on trade and industry, believes that the deficit threatens national security in that the United States depends on foreign debt and foreign investment to finance it. The Trump administration made lowering the deficit with Mexico a priority in its renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It has also signaled that it will move aggressively to combat practices the WTO considers unfair. One such practice is dumping, in which countries subsidize products, such as steel, and sell them abroad for less than their market value.

The Trump administration has also threatened to withdraw the United States from its free trade agreement with South Korea, known by the acronym KORUS, which entered into force in 2012. Since then the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea has doubled and U.S. exports to the country fell by $3 billion, which critics blamed on deliberate policies enacted by Seoul, including currency manipulation and restrictive labor rules. CFR’s Edward Alden says the deal was a “disappointment” since analysts predicted U.S. export growth of at least $10 billion. “South Korea is still a more closed economy than the United States,” he says, “but tearing up KORUS won’t solve that problem.” In August 2018 the United States and South Korea reached an agreement to amend KORUS that included export restrictions on Korean steel and an extended phaseout period for various tariffs.

Some Democratic lawmakers, labor groups, and manufacturers also criticize the deficit on the grounds that some foreign countries—especially China—have used unfair practices like currency manipulation, wage suppression, and government subsidies to boost their exports, while blocking U.S. imports. Some economists argue that China’s competitiveness stems from its protectionism and state involvement in the economy, giving its exports an unfair edge and violating global trade rules. Research by Peterson Institute economists C. Fred Bergsten and Joseph E. Gagnon blames China’s “massive and sustained” currency manipulation from 2000 to 2010 for widening the trade deficit to historic levels.

Though such aggressive manipulation has eased since then, CFR Senior Fellow Brad Setser, a former Treasury official, writes that there is still an East Asian “savings glut,” in which exceptionally high savings rates in the region, partially due to government policy, drive large trade surpluses, which must be absorbed by deficit countries, like the United States.

The deficit has heightened concerns among some economists over job losses and their repercussions in local communities.

Meanwhile, the deficit’s concentration in the manufacturing sector has heightened concerns among some economists over job losses and their repercussions in local communities. (Of the $891 billion goods deficit, over $650 billion consisted of [PDF] manufactured consumer goods and automobile parts.) Research by the Economic Policy Institute suggests that the surge in Chinese imports has lowered wages for non-college-educated workers and cost the United States 3.4 million jobs from 2001-2015, while research published by the University of Chicago put that number [PDF] at closer to 2 million over a similar period (1999-2011). Many economists fear that import-related job losses are driving a populist backlash to trade and globalization that will cause political volatility.

Some economists worry about the consequences of large and persistent imbalances. The Peterson Institute’s Gagnon warns that the debt necessary to finance the deficit is heading toward unsustainable levels. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and Jared Bernstein, an economic advisor to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have argued that the large inflows of foreign capital that accompany trade deficits can lead to financial bubbles and may have contributed to the U.S. housing crash that began in 2006. Others note that a growing deficit has been associated with a weak economy, as in the early 2000s, which they say is evidence of the potential for a large deficit to drain demand from the domestic economy and slow growth when the economy is performing under its potential.

What are the arguments against focusing on the deficit?

For many economists, however, the trade deficit has been scapegoated, and they argue that the trade deficit is not itself a problem for the U.S. economy. That’s because a larger trade deficit can be the result of a stronger economy, as consumers spend and import more while higher interest rates make foreign investors more eager to place their money in the United States.

CFR Distinguished Fellow Michael Froman, a former U.S. trade representative, pushes back on the Trump administration’s emphasis that “trade deficits mean you lose, and surpluses mean you win.” He says that Trump’s narrow focus on trade in goods, which disregards the services surplus, is particularly unhelpful. “Every legitimate economist states that measuring trade policy by the size of the goods deficit is probably not a passing grade in a basic economics class,” he said at a CFR trade symposium in October 2017.

Economists highlight that the singular role of the U.S. economy in providing liquidity to the global economy and driving demand around the world makes a U.S. trade deficit central to global economic stability. The dollar’s role as the global reserve currency and primary tool for global transactions means that many other countries rely on holding dollar reserves, creating massive demand for U.S. financial assets. This means that the U.S. pays little for its foreign borrowing, allowing it to finance its high consumption at low cost, which boosts global demand. Some economists warn [PDF] that moving toward a U.S. trade surplus could lead to lower global growth and more economic instability among U.S. trade partners, though others believe that high foreign demand for U.S. assets burdens the economy and makes achieving full employment more difficult.

Many economists stress that trade boosts the overall economy by lowering prices and increasing productivity. As the Hoover Institution’s Russ Roberts writes, trade, by directing resources to where the economy is most competitive, creates new opportunities and society-wide advances that improve life for everyone in often unforeseen ways. Rather than protecting struggling industries, he says, policy should focus on giving people the skills to compete and flourish in an ever-changing world. Economists also note that traditional ways of measuring economic health, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and trade statistics, have difficulty accounting for the rapid growth of the digital economy and the new types of jobs it created.

Economists worry that too much focus on the deficit could lead to a revival of protectionism and a new global trade war.

According to CFR’s Benn Steil and Emma Smith, protectionist policies would be especially counterproductive because blocking imports without changing underlying savings and investment levels would simply raise the value of the dollar and cause exports to fall as well, leaving the deficit unchanged but reducing overall trade and making the country poorer. Dartmouth College trade expert Douglas Irwin concurs, pointing to past failed attempts to use protectionist policies to close trade deficits. Others point out that there is no correlation between trade deficits and overall unemployment, suggesting that even as imports threaten jobs in one sector, jobs are created in others.

Irwin and others worry that too much focus on the trade deficit could lead to a revival of protectionism and a new global trade war that would make everyone worse off, especially in an era of supply chains that cross many borders. Promises that restrictions on imports from China or elsewhere will revive manufacturing, they say, ignore that technology plays a much larger role in deindustrialization than does trade, and that the U.S. economy began shifting away from manufacturing long before the proliferation of trade agreements in the 1990s.

Instead, the Peterson Institute’s Hufbauer counsels, it is better to recognize that the trade deficit is neither all good or all bad, but rather consists of trade-offs: the U.S. economy benefits from foreign goods and investment even as a high deficit displaces some workers and adds to the national debt.

What are the options to reduce the deficit?

President Trump has promised to reduce the trade deficit, though the administration’s plans remain unclear. Trump’s original suggestion, slapping high tariffs on Chinese goods, would likely be ineffective, but some economists say negotiating better access to the Chinese market for U.S. exporters could help. He also promised to label China a currency manipulator, a designation that experts say would have had few concrete effects, but ultimately changed his mind. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has argued that the problem is high tariffs, subsidies, and other barriers facing U.S. goods in China and Europe. He says that U.S. policy will focus on stepping up trade remedy actions under WTO rules and “making better deals” with trade partners.

CFR’s Alden has written that unilateral measures to block imports like steel due to concerns over foreign subsidies would likely anger U.S. allies and harm many U.S. industries. However, he says, there is a history going back to Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan of U.S. leaders threatening such measures to induce other countries to back off their own trade-distorting policies that Trump might learn from. Nixon and Reagan both threatened allies like Japan and Germany with unilateral tariffs to persuade them to revalue their currencies.

A weaker dollar would likely boost U.S. exports. Trump has said he believes the dollar is “too strong,” though he has not said how he might address it, and the dollar has strengthened since the 2017 tax reform.

Economic reforms in surplus nations could help. Bergsten and Gagnon argue that the United States should pressure countries that use foreign reserve purchases to manipulate their exchange rates by having the U.S. government counter-purchase the foreign currencies of manipulating nations. CFR’s Setser counsels that policymakers should pressure China and other Asian countries to enact policies that will bring down their savings rates.

In the domestic policy arena, boosting the U.S. savings rate could also bring down the trade deficit. As the International Monetary Fund and others have pointed out [PDF], one of the most direct ways to do that is to reduce the government budget deficit. Yet, observers have noted, that is unlikely, given that Trump’s budget proposals have included higher defense and stimulus spending and his 2017 tax cuts further increased the budget deficit. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s likely increases of interest rates should, as in the past, strengthen the dollar, thus increasing the trade deficit."

The two heads of state exchanged extensive and in-depth views on bilateral practical cooperation in major areas, and international and regional issues of common concern. Both sides believed that the meeting between the two heads of state is positive and fruitful. Both sides agreed to make joint efforts to expand fields of mutually beneficial cooperation and control differences on the basis of mutual respect.

Xi Jinping pointed out that the China-US Presidents' Meeting in Mar-a-Lago this time is of unique significance in the development of bilateral relations. Mr. President and I conducted in-depth communication for a long time, deepened mutual understanding, enhanced mutual trust, reached many important consensus and established sound working relations. Both sides should continuously consolidate the established relations, deepen friendly cooperation, and promote bilateral relations, so as to better benefit both countries and the two peoples, and fulfill our historic responsibilities to boost the world peace, stability and prosperity.

Xi Jinping stressed that both countries have become each other's first largest trading partners, and both peoples have benefited a lot from it. China is pushing forward the supply-side structural reform, and continuously expanding domestic demand. The proportion of service industry of the national economy has been constantly improved. China's economy will maintain a sound development momentum, and the enhancement of economic and trade cooperation between both countries enjoys broad prospects. Both sides should seize the opportunities. China welcomes the US to participate in cooperation within the ""Belt and Road"" framework.

Xi Jinping pointed out that bilateral military relationship is an important component of bilateral relations. Mutual trust in military and security area is a foundation of China-US strategic mutual trust. Both sides should maintain military exchanges at all levels, continuously give play to role of dialogue consultation mechanisms including China-US Defence Consultation between the Ministries of National Defence and Asia-Pacific Security Dialogue, and make use of the new platform of Joint Staff Dialogue Mechanism to be established later. Both sides need to well implement the annual exchanges and cooperation projects that have been agreed upon, utilize and continue to improve two major mutual trust mechanisms including the mutual reporting and trust mechanism on major military operations and the code of safe conduct on naval and air military encounters. The two countries should make joint efforts to continuously enhance mutual trust and cooperation between both militaries.

Xi Jinping stressed that China is willing to work with the US to enhance law enforcement cooperation, and jointly fight against all forms of transnational crimes such as drug trafficking, money laundering, cyber crime and organized crime. Both China and the US share important common interests on safeguarding cyber security. Both sides should make use of the dialogue mechanisms on law enforcement and cyber security, so as to jointly promote and build a peaceful, safe, open, cooperative and orderly cyber space. China is making all-out efforts in fighting corruption, and hopes the US could provide more coordination for the Chinese side in fugitive repatriation and asset recovery.

Xi Jinping underlined that people-to-people and cultural exchanges are foundation of bilateral relations. People of both countries enjoy friendly sentiment toward each other. Both countries should enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, expand friendly exchanges between their peoples, promote inter-school cooperation, advance cooperation in tourism, expand exchanges in art, strengthen cooperation in sports, carry out cooperation in health care and consolidate the public opinion foundation of bilateral relations, so as to provide more positive energy for the long-term and healthy development of China-US relations.

Xi Jinping introduced China's development concepts to Donald Trump, and emphasized that China unswervingly sticks to the path of peaceful development, but not the idea of I-win-you-lose, and will not take the old path of big powers which seek hegemony once they grow strong. China stands ready to jointly safeguard the world peace, stability and prosperity with the US.

Donald Trump said that he and the US team are very honored to receive President Xi Jinping and the Chinese delegation in Mar-a-Largo. He and President Xi Jinping held sound talks, and established an extraordinary friendship. The important and fruitful results achieved from this meeting have vigorously promoted the development of bilateral relations. Through launching diplomatic and security dialogue and comprehensive economic dialogue, both teams have conducted direct communication and exchanges, and yielded substantial progress. The US is ready to, together with China, continuously enhance cooperation in various fields including economy, trade, militaries, people-to-people and cultural engagement, and support China's efforts in fugitive repatriation and asset recovery. The US will carry out cooperation with China, and make efforts to eliminate factors and problems which affect bilateral relations, so as to push US-China relations for greater development. US-China relations will certainly enjoy better development.

Wang Huning, Wang Yang, Li Zhanshu, Yang Jiechi, Fang Fenghui, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of the US and several members of cabinet, as well as senior White House officials were present.

After the meeting, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump went for a walk in beautiful and pleasant Mar-a-Largo, and continuously conducted discussions on bilateral friendly cooperation in a relaxed and delightful atmosphere.

Before the meeting between the two heads of state, Vice Premier Wang Yang and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross of the US launched China-US Comprehensive Economic Dialogue Mechanism. State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis of the US initiated China-US Diplomatic and Security Dialogue Mechanism. Both sides conducted in-depth communication on related issues, and discussed the two mechanisms' work agenda for the next step. The two heads of state are satisfied with the preliminary outcomes achieved from the launch of the two mechanisms."

After his election,((This post was originally published in Il Sole 24 Ore.)) it was difficult to predict what President Trump would do. In the election campaign he said everything and the opposite of everything: from a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports to the reintroduction of the separation of commercial and investment banks, from an aggressive use of antitrust authority to the total abolishment of Dodd-Frank, the financial regulation that was enacted after the crisis. After two months, it is clear that the Trump industrial policy will be pro-business, not pro-market.

It may seem to be a nuance, but there is a fundamental difference. A pro-business policy favors existing companies at the expense of future generations. A pro-market policy favors conditions that allow all businesses to thrive without any favoritism. A pro-business policy defends domestic enterprises with favorable rates and treatment. A pro-market policy opens the domestic market to international competition because doing so would not only benefit consumers, but would also benefit the companies themselves in the long term, which will have to learn to be competitive on the market, rather than prosper thanks to protection and state aid. A pro-business policy turns a blind eye (often two) when companies pollute, evade, and defraud consumers. A pro-market policy seeks to reduce the tax and regulatory burden, but ensures that laws are applied equally to all.

Paradoxically, a pro-business policy ends up damaging not only the economy, but also, in the long-run, those companies that it had originally benefited. This matters little to its supporters, because when the chickens come home to roost they will have already grossed billions. Angelo Mozilo, founder of Countrywide, the bank responsible for a large chunk of the toxic mortgages that led to the 2008 crisis, lives happily on the $600 million he accumulated, despite the enormous damage of the financial crisis that he helped to create.

During the presidential campaign Trump used many populist themes. The first signal that his policies will be neither populist nor popular, but strictly pro-business, is his choice of Cabinet members. Trump had promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington of lobbyists. Few realized that he would do that by making intermediaries pointless, as the lobbyists themselves would be in charge of the departments: the CEO of Exxon as head of foreign policy, a former Goldman Sachs partner at the Treasury, the daughter of a ship owner for Transportation, a raider at Commerce, etc.

The second signal was the president-elect’s picks to head the most important government agencies. As the head of the EPA, Trump placed a lawyer who sued the EPA in Oklahoma for the oil industry. As the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump has chosen a lawyer experienced in defending companies accused of fraud and international corruption. What’s more, the new chairman of the SEC is married to a partner at Goldman Sachs, a company regulated by the SEC.

The third signal was Trump’s threat to introduce a “border tax,” another name for a tariff on imports. This tax will not only serve the protectionist desires of some parts of U.S. industries, but also provide financial resources to cover the promised reduction in direct taxation. The tax would be contrary to the World Trade Organization’s rules. However, Trump has threatened that the U.S. will leave the WTO.

The worst signal, however, comes from the way Trump has used his tweets to attack and coax American businesses. United Technologies (UT) has been praised for its decision to cancel plans to close its plant in Indianapolis and relocate it to Mexico. Apparently this decision was the result of tax benefits offered by Vice President-elect Pence, who is the governor of Indiana. In truth, the decision seems motivated by fear of reprisals on government contracts, which represent a large sum of UT’s revenues. A fear that appears justified, as Trump attacked Boeing over the cost (which he considered excessive) of the new presidential aircraft and attacked Lockheed Martin over the F-35 aircraft. Trump is probably right on both counts, and this only adds to his popularity, but a president should address these issues by following the rules and not with an execution on the public square of social media.

With this strategy, Trump cleverly uses the carrot and stick approach. When Ford was publicly commended for deciding not to build a new plant in Mexico, the price of its shares rose 4.5 percent. Softbank did even better (+ 6.2 percent) after being praised by Trump for investing $50 billion in the United States. Softbank’s motive was simple: Softbank owns Sprint, a mobile operator that would like to merge with T-Mobile in order to increase market power. The authority to permit this merger lies with the new head of the Federal Trade Commission, yet to be named by Trump. Trump’s positive tweet feeds Softbank’s hopes that the merger will be approved.

We would expect such behavior from a dictator of a banana republic, not from the President-elect of the oldest democracy in the world. The Trump presidency has begun in the worst possible way for all those who, like me, still believe in the market."

The study found that between 2005 and 2014, refugees “contributed an estimated $269.1 billion in revenues to all levels of government” through the payment of federal, state, and local taxes — which far outweighed their cost to the country. “Overall, this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10-year period, at $63 billion.” When the study was completed in July, however, it was never publicly released, and the Trump administration dismissed the findings. From the New York Times:

White House officials said those conclusions were illegitimate and politically motivated, and were disproved by the final report issued by the agency, which asserts that the per-capita cost of a refugee is higher than that of an American.

The rejected report contradicts the common refrain throughout Donald Trump’s campaign and presidency so far that refugees are an economic burden and a security risk. In a speech to the United Nationals General Assembly on Tuesday, the day after the Times published its report on the study, Trump insisted that the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government, an idea that was disputed not only by the HHS study but by the majority of research on immigration as well.

The Trump administration has a habit of ignoring research that contracts its policy positions. Another recent New York Times report found that scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency were concerned that the findings of 13 federal agencies on the effects of climate change happening right now would never be released to the public. The administration has made no secret of its dismissal of climate change, even banning the term at some federal agencies.

That appears to be what’s happening with the research on refugees at HHS as well. According to the Times report, chief policy adviser Stephen Miller, a crusader against even legal immigration, “personally intervened in the discussions on the refugee cap to ensure that only the costs — not any fiscal benefit — of the program were considered.”"
382,How Trump Policies Affect the Japanese Economy - Nippon.com,How Trump Policies Affect the Japanese Economy  Nippon.com,"Thu, 06 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5pcHBvbi5jb20vZW4vaW4tZGVwdGgvYTA1MzA2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Nippon.com,"What Trump Portends for Japan-US Relations

Since Donald Trump’s election as US president, expectations of his economic policies have pushed up stock prices, interest rates, and the dollar. Economic expert Itoh Motoshige examines the significance of these policies for Japan.

Post-Election Yen Devaluation

Stock prices and exchange rates underwent a great shift from November 8, 2016, the day of the US presidential election. Following the day’s confusion in markets at the victory of Donald Trump, stock prices climbed significantly and the dollar rose against the yen. These movements reflected expectations about the Trump administration’s macroeconomic policies.

The policies are compiled in an easy-to-understand format in the white paper Scoring the Trump Economic Plan, published in September 2016 by Peter Navarro (now director of the National Trade Council) and Wilbur Ross (now secretary of commerce). It emphasizes energy policy reform to promote natural gas exports, decreased regulation of financial markets, dramatic reductions in business taxes, and greater infrastructure and defense spending.

Of course, these policies were floated during the heat of the election, and it is not clear whether they can actually be implemented, or what the Congress will agree to in the way of tax reductions and increased spending. If implemented, however, they would certainly provide a huge stimulus to the US economy, which is already close to full employment.

Based on these forecasts, US long-term interest rates soared immediately after Trump was elected. This led to a strengthening of the dollar, which from a Japanese perspective brought a weakened yen.

Trump’s Own Policies Strengthening Dollar

The economic package will also affect US monetary policy. On March 15, the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates, but the timing for that move was calculated from before Trump became president. The hike was the key to bringing an end to the ultralow interest rates and quantitative easing of the period following the 2008 financial crisis.

If Trump’s policies accelerate rises in prices and wages, interest rates will have to keep up. The Fed will be under the spotlight in terms of how frequently it hikes rates under the Trump administration.

In any case, though, the US economy is now seeing a trend of rising interest rates. While higher rates will help to prevent the economy from overheating, they will also exacerbate the strong dollar and weak yen, with complex effects on the Japanese economy.

President Trump regularly castigates Japanese, Chinese, and German monetary policy, seeking to keep the dollar from strengthening. This movement puts huge pressure on Japanese financial policy and management, as I expand on below. The greatest cause of the rising dollar, however, is not Japan, China, or Germany. It is the Trump administration’s own macroeconomic policies.

Responding to the Interest Rate Gap

The Bank of Japan has stuck to its drastic monetary easing guns in an effort to bring the Japanese economy out of deflation. There have been criticisms that its actions ultimately weaken the yen. Even so, Japan has maintained the stance that quantitative easing is essential to escaping deflation and is not conducted with the aim of manipulating exchange rates. At the same time, the BOJ has made changes to its policies.

There have been two major QE instances since Kuroda Haruhiko became BOJ governor in 2013. The continued commitment to buying long-term government bonds in large quantities sought to erase the market’s deflationary tendencies.

This policy enjoyed some success, but became gradually less effective from around 2015, when changes became apparent in the global economy. These included slowing down of the Chinese economy, slumping crude oil prices caused by general stagnation, and a deflationary trend in Europe. The Japanese consumption tax hike of April 2014 may also have been a factor.

In response, the BOJ shifted its focus last year from easing to interest rate adjustments. Its adoption of negative rates at the start of 2016 was followed by the introduction of yield curve control in September. The latter aimed to maintain the yields of 10-year bonds at close to 0%. While the BOJ has stuck to negative short-term interest rates, it has sought to encourage higher rates of long-term interest, so as not to put excessive pressure on the business of financial institutions.

Meanwhile, US long-term rates shot up after Trump’s election. They presently stand around 2.5%, far above Japan’s rates, which continue to hover near 0%. This gap has clearly pushed the dollar up against the yen. Before the election, the dollar stood at ¥100–¥105, but since late November it has risen to over ¥110. This is favorable for Japanese efforts to pull free of deflation, but there is also some wariness concerning further currency weakening. Trump’s criticism of what he calls Japan’s intentional devaluation is a factor here.

An exchange rate of ¥110–¥115 to the dollar is good for Japan, but further weakening would not benefit the country’s relationship with the United States or its economy. At the same time, it is difficult to know what the Trump administration will do next. After the president withdrew his support for the Republican-authored bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act—popularly known as Obamacare—on March 24, the yen rose. This can be seen as a response to market concerns over the new administration’s ability to enact its policies. So, it is necessary to consider the possible rise of the yen as well as its fall.

A key point regarding how interest rates affect the exchange rate is whether the BOJ continues to maintain long-term interest near 0%. This will no longer be necessary if US interest rates rise further and Japan is able to achieve stable inflation at over 1%. Such observations have not emerged from the BOJ as of yet, but Japan’s long-term interest will be under close scrutiny.

Protectionist Tendencies

The most worrying aspect of the Trump administration is its protectionist stance. Immediately after becoming president, on January 23 Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His attacks on individual companies like Toyota also raise concerns about the trade course he intends to chart.

The Trump administration’s tax reform plan includes the introduction of a 20% border tax on imports. In Europe there is value-added tax of around 20% on goods, which this is also applied to US exports sold in Europe. When European goods are exported to the United States, they become VAT-exempt. This is the nature of the tax, but the Trump administration insists that it makes trade unfair. For this reason, it plans to impose the new border tax.

I do not know whether this policy will obtain the Congressional approval it needs to actually be implemented. If a 20% tariff is levied on imports, though, Japanese automakers—which export many vehicles to the United States from both Japan and Mexico—would suffer a serious blow. Some believe the sluggish share prices of Japanese car companies’ since Trump became president reflect this protectionist risk.

There is a high degree of uncertainty about Trump’s trade policy. If he does what he said on the campaign trail, Japanese industry could face tough times indeed. But some think he will not actually implement the promises he made during the election battle. This uncertainty leads to the gulf between the pessimistic and optimistic outlooks.

A New Free Trade Agreement?

Japanese companies remember the trade friction with the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. They know that they must be prepared to respond rapidly to unforeseen movements. Close dialogue at the governmental level is also key.

The biggest trade issues for the United States are with China and Mexico; America is unlikely to apply direct pressure on Japan for the moment. Based on the February meeting between Prime Minister Abe Shinzō and President Trump, a framework for US-Japan economic talks between Deputy Prime Minister Asō Tarō and US Vice President Mike Pence will also begin. This is a positive development. It is to be hoped that this will lead to ongoing discussions across a range of topics.

There will be keen interest in whether the two countries begin negotiations for a bilateral free trade or economic partnership agreement in place of the TPP. It would be hugely significant for Japan to enter such an agreement with the United States, its largest trading partner and investment destination. Whether Japan could enter negotiations that involve agriculture and other thorny political issues is difficult to foresee at this stage, however.

The legislation, which the GOP aims to muscle through Congress next week, would lower taxes on the richest Americans. Benefits for most other taxpayers would be smaller, but Trump attempted to sell the bill as a ""Christmas present"" for middle-class Americans in part because it would trigger job growth.

""It'll be fantastic for the middle-income people and for jobs, most of all,"" Trump told reporters on the White House lawn before traveling to Camp David for the weekend. ""And I will say that because of what we've done with regulation and other things our economy is doing fantastically well, but it has another big step to go and it can't take that step unless we do the tax bill.""

No stranger to hyperbole, Trump also predicted the legislation would cause the economy to soar beyond its current 3 percent rate of growth.

""I think we could go to 4, 5 or even 6 percent, ultimately,"" the president said. ""We are back. We are really going to start to rock.""

Many economists believe that attaining consistent 4 or 5 percent annual growth would be challenging. The nation last topped 5 percent growth in 1984.

The Republican plan is the widest-ranging reshaping of the tax code in three decades and is expected to add to the nation's $20 trillion debt. The tax cuts are projected to add $1.46 trillion over a decade.

Under the bill, today's 35 percent rate on corporations would fall to 21 percent, the crown jewel of the measure for many Republicans. Trump and GOP leaders had set 20 percent as their goal but added a point to free money for other tax cuts that won over wavering lawmakers in final talks.

""This is happening. Tax reform under Republican control of Washington is happening,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told rank-and-file members in a conference call Friday. ""Most critics out there didn't think it could happen. ... And now we're on the doorstep of something truly historic.""

The bill would repeal an important part of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act — the requirement that all Americans have health insurance or face a penalty — as the GOP looks to unravel a law it failed to repeal and replace this past summer. It came together as Republicans cemented the needed support for the overhaul, securing endorsements from wavering senators.

Marco Rubio of Florida relented in his high-profile opposition after negotiators expanded the tax credit that parents can claim for their children. He said he would vote for the measure next week.

Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the only Republican to vote against the Senate version earlier this month, made the surprise announcement that he would back the legislation. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has repeatedly warned that the nation's growing debt is the most serious threat to national security.

""I realize this is a bet on our country's enterprising spirit, and that is a bet I am willing to make,"" Corker said.

The bill embodies a long-standing Republican philosophy that a substantial tax break for businesses will trigger economic growth and job creation for Americans in a trickle-down economy. Skeptical Democrats are likely to oppose the legislation unanimously.

""Under this bill, the working class, middle class and upper middle class get skewered while the rich and wealthy corporations make out like bandits,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. ""It is just the opposite of what America needs, and Republicans will rue the day they pass this.""

The bill would drop today's 39.6 percent top rate on individuals to 37 percent. The standard deduction — used by around two-thirds of households — would be nearly doubled, to $24,000 for married couples.

The $1,000-per-child tax deduction would grow to $2,000, with up to $1,400 available in IRS refunds for families who owe little or no taxes. Parents would have to provide children's Social Security numbers to receive the child tax credit, a measure intended to deny the credit to people who are in the U.S. illegally.

Those who itemize would lose some deductions. The deduction that millions use in connection with state and local income, property and sales taxes would be capped at $10,000. That's especially important to residents of high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. Deductions for medical expenses that lawmakers once considered eliminating would be retained.

The bill would allow homeowners to deduct interest only on the first $750,000 of a new mortgage, down from the current limit of $1 million.

People who inherit fortunes would get a big break. The bill would double the exemption, meaning the estate tax would apply only to the portion of an estate over $22 million for married couples.

Members of a House-Senate conference committee signed the final version of the legislation Friday, sending it to the two chambers for final passage next week.

Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, and two ailing GOP senators missed votes this past week.

John McCain of Arizona, who is 81, is at a Washington-area military hospital being treated for the side effects of brain cancer treatment, and 80-year-old Thad Cochran of Mississippi had a non-melanoma lesion removed from his nose earlier this week. GOP leaders are hopeful they will be available next week.

On Russia, the Trump administration is already coping with congressional pushback on any efforts to pursue an overly friendly approach. So it is worth asking: What are the areas of international relations where the Trump administration faces less serious resistance? And what will happen there? I think the answer lies in foreign economic policy — for now.

The Trump administration has faced few impediments on implementing its trade agenda. To be fair, that’s because it hasn’t done that much as of yet. The one concrete action is that Trump withdrew from the Trans Pacific Partnership, leading to … hosannas from Senate Democrats. Not much else has happened on this front beyond a lot of rhetoric about tariffs and border adjustment taxes.

Still, there are reasons to believe that Stephen Bannon’s ambitious brand of economic nationalism will face fewer political barriers than his homeland security measures. On the security side of the ledger, Bannon has had to confront opposition from the courts, corporate America, the public, and even Cabinet officials within Trump’s administration. When it comes to trade, however, Trump has the power to implement trade barriers and not much in the way of opposition. You have to squint hard to any real opposition from Trump’s prospective cabinet. The loudest Democrats are just as protectionist-sounding as Trump. And while the public is not as protectionist as pundits believe, the loudest parts of the public are certainly enthusiastic about the idea of eliminating foreign competition.

Share this article Share

That leaves corporate America, which is pretty split on this issue. Bannon’s economic formula is simple. He wants massive domestic deregulation, corporate tax cuts, infrastructure and defense spending, and high protectionist barriers to importing goods, services, and people. Other countries will respond with measures that hurt American exports as well, but I don’t think this bothers Trump’s White House team one little bit. When Peter Navarro talks about deglobalizing America’s manufacturing supply chain, you know you’re in for an administration that wants to radically reshape the American economy.

If implemented, what would be the political and economic effects of this agenda? To use the language of political economy, Bannon’s economic nationalism is an effort to reward non-tradable sectors at the expense of tradable sectors. Infrastructure spending, deregulation, and protectionism will benefit sectors like, say, housing, or coal and oil. Trade and immigration barriers will hurt sectors like tech, commercial aviation, and higher education. Within manufacturing, less competitive firms might receive a boost as well. Other sectors, like agriculture, will face severely mixed effects.

There’s an interesting pattern at work here. This kind of economic nationalism boosts the parts of the country that went for Trump in the 2016 election. In theory, boosting domestic energy and manufacturing helps Appalachia, Texas, and the industrial Midwest. The areas of the country that would be hard hit from such policies are on both coasts — i.e., the places that really did not like Donald Trump. Fans of William Riker’s “minimum winning coalition” could argue that Trump’s foreign economic policies might be designed to cement the fragile coalition that got him elected.

Of course, this assumes that the primary effects of Bannon’s economic nationalism are distributional in nature. Indeed, the behavior of financial markets to date suggested that the pluses of corporate tax cuts and fiscal pump-priming would outweigh and symbolic efforts at protectionism. But it’s beginning to dawn on some observers that maybe the Trump administration is actually serious about erecting all of these economic barriers to the outside world. We’re already seeing Silicon Valley planning to relocate foreign workers to Canada. If there are more immigration restrictions to come — and it seems like that is the case — then the United States economy could start feeling the negative effects of a massive brain drain."

Contradicting rhetoric from his presidential campaign, President Donald Trump explained why he chose Wall Street billionaires for several of his Cabinet roles during a campaign-style rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Wednesday evening.

“So somebody said, ‘Why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy?’ I said, ‘Because that’s the kind of thinking we want … because they’re representing the country. They don’t want the money. And they had to give up a lot to take these jobs.”

“We can’t have the world taking advantage of us anymore,” Trump added. “And I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person,” Trump added. “Does that make sense? If you insist, I’ll do it — but I like it better this way, right?”

Trump appointed a number of Wall Street executives to his Cabinet, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross of WL Ross & Co., and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin of Goldman Sachs.

Gary Cohn, the former president and COO of Goldman Sachs, is now Trump’s chief economic adviser and director of the National Economic Council.

“He went from massive pay days to peanuts,” Trump said of Cohn at the rally.

During his campaign in 2016, Trump railed against his opponents for their ties to Wall Street. He frequently criticized Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for accepting money from Goldman Sachs to deliver speeches.

And, while Trump painted Wall Street executives as champions of the economy in his speech on Wednesday, he strongly criticized them in Jan. 2016 at a rally in Iowa.

“I know Wall Street,” Trump said, according to the Wall Street Journal. “I know the people on Wall Street … I’m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us.”"

In his first six and a half months in office, the President has promised economic prosperity and a revitalization of American industry.

And he's boasted about his success — using the record-setting stock market, and an ongoing job-market recovery — to claim credit for energizing the U.S. economy.

Trump is right that stocks are at a record, and job creation continues. What's wrong is the suggestion that this is reversing a decline that was in place before the new administration took office.

It's time to take another look under the hood.

The good news for Trump is that many parts of the economy are still humming. Trump is taking credit particularly for strong job growth and record high stock prices. The housing market is another bright spot. And the trade deficit has narrowed.

Here's a more detailed look at the economy, 200 days into the Trump presidency.

1. Jobs

It's hard to find fault with the latest jobs numbers. The unemployment rate is 4.3%, a 16-year low. The economy has added more than 1 million jobs since Trump took office.

On the other hand, wage growth has yet to really pick up. Employers still don't feel pressure to offer big salaries to attract the workers they need. Average hourly earnings have increased only 2.5% over the past 12 months. The Federal Reserve would rather see 3% to 3.5%.

Still, because inflation is low, those wage gains are helping many Americans.

2. Housing prices

They're red hot.

The average price for an existing home in June was a record $263,800, or 6.5% higher than a year ago. June was the 64th consecutive month of gains compared with a year earlier.

And borrowing money to buy a house remains relatively affordable, despite recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage is just 3.93%, according to Freddie Mac, down from 4.02% three months ago.

3. Lending

Consumers aren't borrowing just to buy homes. They're taking on debt for cars and using credit cards for lots of other things.

Americans had $3.843 trillion in loans outstanding in May, up from $3.766 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Fed.

And businesses are borrowing more, reversing a trend from earlier this year. That could be a good sign for Trump and the economy. Consumers can't prop up the economy alone: Companies need to pull their weight and invest.

4. Consumer spending

Big stores including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) report earnings this week, and the results could be lousy.

The dominance of Amazon (AMZN) is one reason. But Americans may also be spending less on clothes, toys and other smaller purchases -- even though they're taking out more loans.

Retail sales fell 0.2% in June. Economists were expecting a slight increase. And overall consumer spending was up just 0.1% in June.

Spending has increased 2.8% over the past 12 months, a bit below the 3% pace many experts feel is necessary to keep the economy on track.

5. Trade

Trump wants more consumers -- in the United States and around the globe -- to buy American. And it looks like that's starting to happen.

The trade deficit fell slightly in June from three months ago, to $43.6 billion. That's the lowest since just before the election.

America's suddenly vibrant oil industry is a big reason the balance is shifting. Thanks to technologies like fracking, the United States exported more crude in June and imported less.

Exports to Canada and Mexico rose in June, too, a possible sign that Trump's tough talk is working with America's two big North American trading partners.

China is still a sore spot. The U.S. trade deficit with China is up more than 6% this year.

6. Stocks

An undeniable win for the president. Fears of a market collapse under Trump have proved to be misguided.

The Dow keeps hitting records and is up 12% this year.

And the blue chips are lagging. The Nasdaq has surged nearly 20% thanks to big gains in Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).

For now, Wall Street is willing to ignore the turmoil in the Trump administration. Investors are hoping for eventual changes to the tax code and deregulation of the financial industry.

Strong earnings don't hurt, either. Profits for the companies in the S&P 500 are up more than 10% from a year ago."

During a press briefing, Trump flipped through thick binders of what he said were unnecessary and burdensome environmental reviews holding up a highway project. He flopped them around the table until microphones picked up an audible ""thunk"" and then dropped them to the ground.

He pledged to cut through the ""dense thicket of rules, regulation and red tape"" he said were causing ""terrible delays"" for infrastructure permits.

Trump also announced the White House will be setting up a new council to help project managers navigate bureaucracy, and an ""online dashboard"" to track projects through the approval process and impose ""tough penalties"" on federal agencies that delay projects.

He also said the White House would create a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality, ""to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal, state and local procedures.""

But he didn't unveil a formal plan for achieving any of these goals.

A week of speeches and non-binding letters

The President's remarks capped a week of non-starters.

On Wednesday he delivered an infrastructure speech in Cincinnati that offered no new details on his plans.

Nor did his remarks address the paradox of promising to boost highways while his own budget outline proposed cuts to the Highway Trust Fund that could delay local projects in the city he was speaking in, like the crumbling Brent Spece Bridge that carries traffic from two major highways into Cincinnati.

On Monday, surrounded by flashing cameras, politicians and business leaders, President Trump kicked everything off by signing non-binding memos and a letter to Congress asking lawmakers to work on a bill to privatize air traffic control.

""We have studied numerous countries, one in particular, they have a very, very good system; ours is going to top it by a lot,"" he said in a speech after the ceremony in the East Room.

Like the signing of a major piece of legislation, he handed out pens to lawmakers and took in applause. Then it was quickly denounced by Democrats.

What is known of Trump's sketched out infrastructure plans include calls for a $200 billion boost in federal spending that is supposed to trigger $800 billion in private financing through public-private partnerships.

Infrastructure stocks unmoved

By Friday, however, Infrastructure Week hadn't moved infrastructure stocks much.

What do the markets know, and when did they know it?

In March, stocks of Caterpillar, U.S. Steel and construction materials supplier Vulcan Materials all rose on Trump's first address to Congress in late February promoting his plans to invest $1 trillion in new bridges, roads, tunnels, airports and railways through a combination of public and private investment. Along with banking stocks, these helped carry the Dow to a record high of 21,000.

This week by Friday mid-day, U.S. Steel had risen from $20 to $22 per share, Vulcan Materials went from $126 to $130, and Caterpillar ended where it started Monday, at $106.

And despite the president's promises, management at top infrastructure companies hasn't been issuing new guidance to investors and isn't factoring in boosts to federal spending in their forecasts.

""The 2017 guidance we provided in February and reaffirm today does not reflect any benefits that may be gained from potential legislation, increasing federal infrastructure investment,"" Howard Nye, the CEO of Martin Marietta, a leading supplier of heavy building materials, said in its first quarter report."

(AP) -- President Donald Trump announced plans Wednesday to re-examine federal requirements governing the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks, moving forcefully against Obama-era environmental regulations that Trump says are stifling economic growth.

Trump was set to reveal his plans during a speech at an automotive testing center near Detroit, but he previewed the announcement during a round-table meeting at the American Center for Mobility with auto company executives and workers, just before the speech.

""This is going to be a new era for American jobs and job creation,"" Trump said.

The EPA under Obama had promulgated a rule for cars and trucks requiring a fleet-wide average of 36 mpg in real-world driving by 2025.

Trump's announcement, while having no immediate effect, is expected to set the stage for weaker fuel efficiency standards as well as drawn-out legal battles with environmental groups and states such as California that adopted their own tough tailpipe standards for drivers.

""These standards are costly for automakers and the American people,"" said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. He promised a ""thorough review"" that will ""help ensure this national program is good for consumers and good for the environment.""

The decision to reopen the review requires EPA to determine no later than April 2018, whether the 2022-2025 standards established are appropriate. If the EPA determines they are not appropriate, the agency will submit a new proposal next year.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers - which represents a dozen major car manufacturers including General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota - praised Trump's action. It said he was creating an opportunity for federal and state officials to ""reach a thoughtful and coordinated outcome predicated on the best and most current data.""

Environmental groups said Trump and his team appeared intent on easing gas-mileage requirements set by Obama.

""If they succeed we'll pay more at the pump, depend more on oil from bad countries, drive up the trade deficit and pollute our kids' atmosphere,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign.

As a practical matter, Trump's announcement will target the Obama administration's January decision to lock in strict gas mileage requirements for cars and light trucks, ending a review process before the Democrat left office.

Back in 2012, the Obama administration set fuel-economy regulations for model years 2017-2025 and agreed to complete a midterm evaluation by 2018. But seven days before Obama left office, the EPA decided to keep the stringent requirements it had set in place for model years 2022 to 2025. The industry balked at the decision, insisting it was rushed through to beat the change in administrations.

Trump said he's putting that midterm review back on track, so officials can spend another year studying the issue before setting new standards in 2018.

While the administration has not said explicitly it wants to weaken the standards, a senior White House official said the Obama-era EPA had ignored reams of data cited by the automotive industry. The official spoke on condition of anonymity at a White House briefing in order to outline the action, despite the president's criticism of the use of unnamed -named sources.

The Auto Alliance last month urged EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to relax the standards, saying they will drive up car costs, price customers out of the market and depress the industry. Obama's EPA had argued the costs to consumers were mitigated by gas savings and that the rules would decrease greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.

Trump campaigned on eliminating ""job killing"" regulations, and the administration is expected to take additional steps in the coming days to roll back environmental regulations.

Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the change ""makes no sense.""

""Mileage standards save consumers money at the gas pump, make Americans less dependent on oil, reduce carbon pollution and advance innovation,"" she said.

After the speech, Trump will head to Nashville, Tennessee, to lay a wreath at President Andrew Jackson's tomb to mark what would have been Jackson's 250th birthday, before holding a campaign-style rally in the city.

Trump will tour Jackson's home, according to Howard Kittell, president and CEO of the Hermitage mansion. Jackson has enjoyed something of a resurgence thanks to Trump. During the campaign, some of Trump's aides took to comparing him to the former president - a fellow populist outsider who took on a member of the Washington establishment and ran a campaign railing against corrupt elites.

Trump mused during his first days in Washington that ""there hasn't been anything like this since Andrew Jackson"" and hung a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office.

Historians had been souring on the slave-owning president whose Indian Removal Act of 1830 commissioned the forced removal of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands. More than 4,000 died during their journeys west.

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday the president will deliver that message during his stop at Snap-on Inc. in Kenosha. Spicer calls Snap-on “a prime example of a company that builds American made tools with American workers, for U.S. taxpayers.”

Snap-on is based in Wisconsin but operates around the world. The company has eight manufacturing sites in North America and employs 11,000 people worldwide, according to its website.

Snap-on said in a statement it hopes the visit highlights “the essential nature of American manufacturing to our nation’s future.”

It will be the president’s first visit to the state since taking office. He plans to talk about the economy and the value of American jobs during the stop.

Trump will be in House Speaker Paul Ryan’s congressional district where he faces low approval ratings in the wake of his failure to fulfill a campaign promise to repeal and replace the federal health care law.

Ryan won’t be in attendance because he’s leading a congressional delegation on an overseas trip this week.

Gov. Scott Walker said he plans to talk with Trump about the problem Wisconsin dairy farmers are having selling their milk.

Trump will speak publicly about the economy, but Walker said Monday he looks forward to speaking privately with Trump about a trade issue that’s hurting the state’s dairy farmers.

State and federal officials from Wisconsin have asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to take action to help dairy farmers hurt by Canada’s decision to impose duties on imports of a product called ultra-filtered milk.

Shipments of ultra-filtered milk, which is used in cheese-making, had been duty free until recently, after Canadian milk producers objected.

Canada’s decision leaves about 75 Wisconsin dairy farmers with no market.

Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairwoman Martha Laning said Trump coming to the state to talk about the importance of manufacturing jobs is one thing, but fulfilling his campaign promises is another.

Laning said Monday that Trump is “full of empty promises” on job creation. “We are going to hold him accountable to the promises he made,” Laning said.

Laning said the Republican agenda under Walker has hurt the economy and she worries Trump will do no better.

Wisconsin’s unemployment is at a 17-year low, but neighboring states have been adding jobs at a higher rate.

Trump carried Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes in November, making him the first Republican to carry the state since 1984. A Marquette University Law School poll released in March showed 47 percent of respondents disapproved of the job Trump was doing as president, while 41 percent approved.

The president is also expected to travel to Atlanta on Friday, April 28 to speak at the National Rifle Association’s annual leadership forum, according to the organization.

He pledged during the campaign to fight to protect the Second Amendment and was endorsed by the NRA.

But documents released last week by the Department of Homeland Security show that the Trump administration is preparing to crack down on illegal immigration, with a particular focus on deporting the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. We asked associate professor Alicia Sasser Modestino, a labor market expert in the College of Social Sciences and Humanities, to explain how the implementation of Trump’s deportation plan might impact the nation’s economy.

Five percent of the U.S. workforce is made up of illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Research Center . If Trump follows through with his mass deportation plan, how, if at all, will these jobs be replaced?

Basic supply and demand theory tells us that in the short run, employers would be scrambling to fill those jobs and would have to increase wages to attract native workers. Given the relatively tight labor market in the U.S., with unemployment under 5 percent, it would be difficult to fill so many jobs all at once. In addition, it’s not clear that native workers would be willing to take those jobs without a significant hike in wages—particularly in jobs in agriculture, construction, and janitorial services where employers can pay illegal immigrants below market wages.

In the long run, it’s unlikely that we would have to replace each and every one of those jobs previously held by someone who was deported. This is because over time firms have more flexibility to change production processes to use less labor and more capital. We’ve already seen an increase in automation in both the manufacturing and agriculture sectors—a trend that we would expect to accelerate if labor suddenly became more expensive with the deportation of so many workers.

In fact, this is exactly what happened during the 1960s when President Kennedy ended the bracero program. The program, which allowed almost half a million people a year to take seasonal work on America’s farms, was said to be driving down wages and taking jobs from Americans. After the program was abruptly ended, there was a small but temporary increase in native farm employment in states where farmers had relied heavily on foreign labor—such as California and Texas. Yet within a few years agricultural employment was again declining similar to states where there had been no braceros. Rather than leading to higher wages and more work for Americans in the fields, farmers turned to machines.

Still, the scale of the proposed deportation is such that it’s likely the U.S. economy will suffer some employment loss and see rising wages in those sectors where illegal immigrants are most likely to work. However, the magnitude of the effects on the labor market will depend on how willing natives are to fill those jobs vacated by immigrants and the degree to which employers can substitute capital for labor.

Shrinking the labor force by 5 percent would likely increase wages and the cost of goods, creating inflation and higher interest rates. What other unintended consequences might Trump’s deportation plan have on the economy both here and abroad?

Few economists would argue that immigration helps fuel the U.S. economy. When immigrants enter the labor force, they increase the productive capacity of the economy and raise GDP. Their incomes rise, but so do those of natives—particularly business owners who benefit from the cheap labor. While empirical estimates peg this “immigration surplus” to be a rather small share of additional GDP—typically 0.2 to 0.4 percent—it still amounts to $36 billion to $72 billion per year. Trump’s deportation plan would certainly mean the loss of some portion of that surplus, leading to slower economic growth.

Immigrants also “grease the wheels” of the labor market by flowing into industries and areas where there is a relative need for workers—they typically move to where the jobs are. This added flexibility is important to help alleviate shortages or surpluses that would otherwise limit economic growth or hinder an economic recovery. For example, during and after World War II, Mexican immigrants were instrumental in alleviating shortages arising from the war effort. Deporting a sizeable share of the most adaptable part of our workforce means that the U.S. economy is less able to adjust to future economic shocks—whether they are booms or busts—as well as demographic changes such as an aging population.

Finally, it’s hard to say how much of a “chilling” effect the deportation plan and the recent travel ban will have on legal immigration. Why is this important? Recent immigrants are much more highly educated than previous generations—among immigrants ages 25 and older residing in the U.S. in 2015, 48 percent of those who arrived after 2010 have a bachelor’s degree compared to only 27 percent of those who arrived in 2005 or earlier. By comparison, 31 percent of native-born adults have a bachelor’s degree.

Recent immigrants are most likely to hold professional or technical jobs such as medical scientists, software developers, physical scientists, and economists. This rise in high-skilled immigration has also been linked to innovation, specifically to higher patenting rates among immigrants.

Thus the recent shift in immigration policy may have far-reaching consequences affecting the ability of the U.S. to attract and retain skilled immigrants on which states such as Massachusetts rely quite heavily to fuel growth in the state’s higher education programs as well as its overall labor force. Moreover, employers are concerned that President Trump will also move to limit the H1B visa program for skilled immigrants, which he has called a “cheap labor program” in the past. As a result, these skilled individuals may be more likely to seek opportunities across the globe as well as in their home countries spurring growth and innovation abroad.

Some states, including Arizona and Georgia, have seen strict immigration laws backfire , leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. What might the Trump administration learn by studying these cases?

Arizona is the poster child of strict immigration laws beginning with the passage of the Legal Arizona Workers Act that tried to regulate unauthorized workers out of the market using E-Verify, an electronic employment eligibility verification system used to weed out unauthorized immigrants when they apply for a job. In the first four years after the law was passed, employment dropped by 15.6 percent in crop production compared to an increase in neighboring New Mexico and California over the same time period. A recent report by the right-leaning Cato Institute concludes that the LAWA explains much of that difference.

Two years later Arizona passed SB 1070 to enforce immigration laws outside of the workplace. The anti-immigration laws exacerbated the impact of the Great Recession with 200,000 forced out of the state and others deterred from entering. Estimates suggest that the drastic reduction in the supply of illegal immigrants in Arizona has reduced the state’s GDP by an average of 2 percent per year between 2008 and 2015.

Keep in mind that the impact of reduced immigration on an individual state such as Arizona is likely to be larger than what one would expect nationwide. This is because immigrants can migrate to other states with fewer restrictions and a more welcoming labor market. However, the lesson is clear that the Trump administration cannot repeal the laws of economics: there will be real consequences for both the labor market and the economy if the U.S. follows through on a mass deportation of such magnitude.

The implementation of Trump’s deportation plan could disproportionately impact the industries in which a large number of undocumented immigrants work, including hospitality, construction, and manufacturing. What kind of ripple effect might potential losses in the hardest hit sectors have on the economy as a whole?

Given that immigration comes with both benefits and costs, it’s important to keep in mind that the proposed deportation plan would entail much of the same but in reverse. In terms of direct effects, we would expect that in the short run, the wages of native workers in the affected industries would increase. However, the higher cost of labor would cause employers to possibly curtail any plans for growth and-or substitute labor for machines, which would ultimately mean lower employment in these industries in the long run. The National Bureau of Economic Research study cited earlier suggests that at an average of $500 billion in output a year, removing all illegal immigrants would be like losing the equivalent of Massachusetts from the U.S. economy.

In terms of indirect effects, the cost of goods in these industries would rise in the short run, meaning that consumers would likely be paying higher prices for all sorts of goods including private household services, fresh fruits and vegetables, and apparel. This would serve to increase inflation and potentially motivate the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. All in all, we would expect slower economic growth in the wake of a mass deportation—the exact opposite of what the Trump administration is promising in its first term."

The truth is, however, that there is no factual basis for the claim that stricter standards have killed jobs. There is, however, abundant evidence that these regulations have saved Americans billions of dollars at the pump, bolstered U.S. energy independence, fostered automotive innovation, and led to major reductions in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

In taking this step, President Trump is following a prompt from the auto industry, whose two major trade associations have been angling to weaken the standards. Their complaints are among a slew of special pleadings sent to a new White House clearly sympathetic to big-league moneyed interests. In fact, when the EPA posted a notice on its web site last week announcing that it was reviewing the greenhouse gas emission standards, it prominently placed a link to the Auto Alliance’s request to reconsider the regulations. I, for one, can’t recall when a public agency prominently featured the opinions of lobbyists for an industry it regulates on an official federal webpage. Those of us who follow this issue were braced for this assault on environmental protection, one of many that are already underway, such as undermining the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, weakening rules to stop methane leaks during oil and gas production, and pulling out of the Paris climate accords. The list goes on. With transportation now the nation’s largest source of CO2 emissions (ahead of electricity generation), a steady clampdown on tailpipe CO2 is particularly important if our country is to do its part in slowing climate change. Weakening the greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards will undercut this crucial effort. Given the due diligence performed by the Obama administration when it developed the standards — in consultation with the auto industry — such a move cannot be justified either technically or economically.

With transportation now the nation’s largest source of CO2, a steady clampdown on tailpipe emissions is particularly important.

We’ve seen this gambit before. In 1986, after gasoline prices fell from their energy-crisis highs, General Motors and Ford asked the Reagan administration to roll back the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards, which the year before had reached their original target of 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg). Reagan’s appointees complied, lowering the standard to 26 mpg for several years. What we saw then, and are now seeing again, was a deliberate crippling of regulations that in reality — and in spite of much rhetoric to the contrary — carefully balance costs to industry with the need to address real public health, safety, and environmental concerns. After all, the original CAFE standards were signed by President Gerald Ford, a Michigan Republican, in 1975. The key Clean Air Act provisions that successfully slashed tailpipe pollution, and that provide the legal basis for the more recent motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards, were developed under the administration of Richard Nixon, who signed them into law in 1970. Those two bipartisan laws are the foundation for the synchronization of automotive greenhouse gas emissions and CAFE standards that President Obama brokered during his first term. Both Nixon and Ford were business-friendly Republicans, but ones who recognized that as national leaders they had many other legitimate public concerns to address. Well, times have changed. Trump’s speech at the Willow Run factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, was mostly about jobs and how decades of bad trade policies had undermined U.S. employment. At least publicly, he didn’t actually say that much about the emission rules, although he did cast them as part of what was to blame for job losses. Like many other U.S. wage earners, autoworkers have suffered from years of anti-labor economic policies and unfair trade agreements. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders tapped into this justifiable discontent. But it’s Trump who has embraced the deceitful lobbying lines about “job-killing regulations” that have been among Republican talking points for the past few decades.

Trump has embraced the deceitful lobbying lines about ‘job killing regulations’ that have long been among Republican talking points.

In fact, fuel economy and emissions regulations have not harmed jobs. Auto efficiency standards have always been structured with American workers in mind. The current standards include multiple levels of flexibility that accommodate market shifts due to fluctuating fuel prices; the rules also defer to the dubious proposition that more lenient regulations for top-selling light trucks would help protect union jobs. What the regulations do is shape how automakers allocate their budgets. Trimming a vehicle’s CO2 emission rate may involve, for example, developing a new transmission. (Transmissions have, in fact, seen a lot of innovation in recent years in response to the need for higher fuel efficiency.) Those development costs mean jobs for engineers. Building the redesigned transmissions then creates jobs for assembly workers. So whatever additional costs are incurred go right back into materials and labor, including jobs for steelworkers and others involved in supplying parts and materials to the auto industry. Studies that falsely claim job losses due to regulation assume that the cost of improved technology somehow falls into a “black hole” and disappears from the economy, taking jobs with it. But that’s just not true. In reality, it’s not regulations that have harmed jobs, but often a lack of foresight on the part of management at the U.S.’s Big Three automakers. The latest market collapse, in 2008, triggered massive job losses — even though it followed two decades of declining vehicle efficiency tied to stagnant CAFE standards. Although the economic meltdown was caused by larger financial factors, autoworkers were among those who bore the brunt of the pain, and not for the first time. But it wasn’t just the recession that pushed General Motors and Chrysler into bankruptcy, and Ford close to the brink. Having lobbied successfully to cripple the CAFE standards, the Big Three didn’t bother to improve the fuel efficiency of their pickup trucks and SUVs. They also failed to invest in competitive compact cars. Their sales then experienced the double whammy of a recession plus a shift away from gas guzzlers; GM and Chrysler could not survive without a federal bailout. Since then, as the economy recovered, so did car and truck sales. At the same time, fuel efficiency continued to rise, at first in response to the high pump prices, but more recently guided by the tighter CAFE standards and greenhouse gas regulations. Each of the past two years saw record new vehicle sales, yet at the same time improved technology continued to trim fleet average CO2 emissions. In the past decade, the CO2 emission rate has declined by an average of 2.3 percent per year. It’s not nearly as steep a decline as seen during the 1970s oil crisis years, but nevertheless represents significant progress.

That progress is slower than it could be reflects the breaks given to the industry when the rules were crafted. Just to name a few: The standards for both cars and trucks get weaker as the vehicles get larger. In addition, vans, minivans, pickups, and many SUVs are classified as light trucks and subject to weaker standards than cars. Then there’s a special provision for the largest light trucks, which are termed “work trucks,” but in reality are mostly luxurious macho fashion statements, many of which never see a construction site or farm. In short, the car companies — and especially the former Big Three — already cobbled many layers of regulatory relief into the complex structure of the standards. Before the election, automakers had plans well underway to re-engineer their vehicles in line with tighter standards over the coming decade. Ample technology is in the pipeline for making steady gains in efficiency (and steady cuts in CO2 emission rates) for years to come. The feasibility of meeting the standards has been studied exhaustively for many years now. (I was an author of some early studies that helped make the case for the standards.) These studies all conclude that steady refinements of gasoline engines — cutting excess mass through high-strength steel and other advanced materials — and further streamlining would not only enable automakers to reach the standards now targeted for 2025, but also continue improving efficiency beyond that. Over the five-year phase-in leading up to the 2025 target, the incremental cost per vehicle will average only $240 per year. That’s less than one percent of the average sticker price and so well within the cost-savings automakers routinely achieve each year through productivity gains. That’s why new car and light truck prices may not increase as a result of the stronger federal standards, and why there is likely to be no observable impact on either vehicle sales or manufacturing jobs. Automakers note that according to EPA’s own economic analysis, they will have to cumulatively spend $200 billion to comply with the standards over the 2012-2025 period. But to call that number “staggering,” as they do in their plea to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, takes it out of context. Over that same time period, the new car and light truck market will rack up at least $7 trillion in revenue. So the $200 billion cost estimate amounts to only 3 percent of gross sales.

Environmental protection is not something that can be left to the ups and downs of oil prices and other market whims.

One of the arguments that automakers make against the standards is that, with pump prices lower than when the rules were set five years ago, consumers are no longer as interested in efficient vehicles. But that’s the very reason why we need standards. Environmental protection is not something that can be left to the ups and downs of oil prices and other market whims. This is also why the EPA is wise to set standards a decade in advance, providing automakers with plenty of lead time to redesign vehicles for better efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. Just as was the case for smog-causing pollutants, regulation is essential for success in solving the problem. And it clearly wasn’t something to leave up to consumers themselves — e.g., whether individuals would spend the extra few hundred dollars it costs to put a catalytic converter system on a car. A generation ago, the oil embargo and other energy market issues provided the rationale for CAFE standards, which took auto efficiency a big step forward, saving consumers money and also helping reduce oil prices for a time. Then conceit set in, fostered by a special interest-driven Reagan administration that rolled back CAFE standards and ushered in two decades of backsliding on auto efficiency. That period of complacency came crashing down just over a decade ago; recall that the move to begin raising CAFE standards actually began under the George W. Bush Administration, which crafted the 2007 energy bill calling for much higher standards."

Donald Trump laid out his plan for the economy, criticizing globalization and policies that promote free trade, in a speech in Monessen, Pa., on Tuesday.

NPR's politics team has annotated Trump's speech. The portions we commented on are bolded, followed by analysis and fact check in italics. We will update further.

The speech follows:

Thank you everybody. I'd like to thank the owner of the plant. I'd like to thank Rick Santorum, our great senator. And I have to say all of the amazing workers. Gabe [Hudock] said they're the most important. The amazing workers.

And I know you've been through some very, very tough times. But we're going to make it better and we're going to make it better fast. Just watch. It is great to be here. I'd like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us.

So today, I am going to talk about how to make America wealthy again. Have to do it.

We are 30 miles from Steel City. Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation.

The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape.

But our workers' loyalty — you know it better than anybody — was repaid with total betrayal.

Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization — moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas.

[The Trump campaign provided a footnoted version of this speech on its website. Interestingly, this passage and others later in the speech cite research from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank whose research has often been cited by Bernie Sanders, among others. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very, wealthy. I used to be one of them. Hate to say it, but I used to be one. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.

[Trump seems to be acknowledging one of the biggest criticisms leveled at his campaign. He runs on fiercely protectionist policies, but many of the goods produced under his name (as well as his daughter Ivanka's) have been produced in other countries, as Harvard's Robert Lawrence detailed in a March column at PBS. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians have proven, folks, have proven, they do nothing.

For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into Depression-level unemployment. Many of these areas have still never recovered. And never will unless I become president. Then they're going to recover fast.

Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families.

Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands and thousands of miles away.

Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state [of] despair. This wave of globalization has wiped out totally, totally, our middle class. It doesn't have to be this way. We can turn it all around — and we can turn it around fast.

But if we're going to deliver real change, we're going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.

The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything — and say anything — to keep things exactly the way they are.

The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing is going to change.

The inner cities will remain poor. The factories will remain closed. The borders will remain open. The special interests will remain firmly in control.

Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small — and they want to scare American people out of voting for a better future. And you have a great future, folks. You have a great future. These people have given her tens of billions of dollars.

My campaign has the absolute opposite message.

I want you to imagine a much better life and a life where you can believe in the American dream again. Right now you can't do that. I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who've led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster to another.

Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders. I was on the right side of that issue, as you know — with the people — I was there, I said it was going to happen, I felt it — while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and President Obama predicted that one and many others, totally wrong.

Now it's time for the American people to take back their future. They're going to take it back.

That's the choice we face. We can either give in to Hillary Clinton's campaign of fear, or we can choose to believe again in America.

Very sadly, we lost our way when we stopped believing in our country.

America became the world's dominant economy by becoming the world's dominant producer. You know that from right here. Right in this plant.

The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known.

But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America — in, in, in America — to promoting development in other nations. That's what's happening and that's what happened.

We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable. And our politicians did nothing about it.

Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result.

I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.

[Promoting the growth of manufacturing is an economic policy that embodies Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. Manufacturing employment is down by 37 percent since its peak in 1979, and politicians often point at the decline of manufacturing jobs as a symbol of the declining middle class — these jobs were once a clear path to a middle-class life for many Americans. But over the years, the U.S. economy has become increasingly service-based. Manufacturing employment has rebounded some, but it's hard to see all those manufacturing jobs coming back. In addition, to be clear, manufacturing jobs have fallen off, but not manufacturing production, which has grown over time, interrupted mainly by recessions. — Danielle Kurtzleben [Manufacturing employment did drop off steeply after China joined the WTO and fell further during the Great Recession. Since bottoming out in 2010, though, the U.S. has added 832,000 factory jobs. While outsourcing accounts for some of the job loss, it's also true that today's American manufacturers are highly efficient, requiring fewer workers to produce the same or more stuff. — Scott Horsley]

Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export. Can't continue to do that.

[Trump's statement here is accurate. The trade deficit in goods was $762.565 billion for 2015, as noted on Page 6 of this census report. When combining goods and services, the U.S. trade deficit drops to $500.361 billion, because of a trade surplus on services. — Will Huntsberry]

This is not some natural disaster. It is political and politician-made disaster. Very simple. And it can be corrected. And we can correct it fast. When we have people with the right thinking, right up here. It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism. This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who America wanted to be strong, they wanted this country to be strong, and they wanted it to be independent and they wanted it to be free.

Our Founding Fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians, believe me. George Washington said that ""the promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.""

Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the ""expediency of encouraging manufacturing in — in, in, in — the United States."" And listen to this. The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that ""the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government ... will produce want and ruin among our people."" He understood it much better than our current politicians. That's why he was Abraham Lincoln, I guess.

[Associating your policies with the Founders and Lincoln arguably has a sort of halo effect — you can link your ideas to figures that everyone loves (not to mention one Founder in particular who is so hot right now). But that doesn't mean protectionist policies of the 18th and 19th centuries could be justified in the same way today. We asked Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, about this. [For one thing, he said, not everyone at the time agreed that protectionism was a good thing. [""The issue was a major source of dispute in the 1800s between the agricultural interests who wanted trade and the eastern industrialists who wanted protection,"" he wrote in an email. One argument was that the developing U.S. economy had ""infant industries"" that needed protection. ""Of course, the infant industry argument is not attractive to the United States today when we have the largest and most advanced economy, but we do hear infant industry arguments from some poorer emerging markets,"" he wrote. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs — emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production.

Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside down.

We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, and then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free. How stupid is this? How could it happen? How stupid is this?

As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to declare our economic independence once again. That means voting for Donald Trump. I'll do it. No doubt about it. Not even a little doubt.

It also means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years. America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 — even as the country has increased its population by, think of this, 50 million people.

At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the disaster called NAFTA. Second, China's entry into the World Trade Organization.

NAFTA was the worst trade deal in the history, it's like this history of this country,



[It's hard to say what Trump's gauge is for ""worst in history."" But NAFTA doesn't seem to have been catastrophic for the U.S. economy or for U.S. jobs. As we pointed out in our last Trump speech annotation, nonpartisan analyses have found only a small economic impact from NAFTA. The Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2015 report, ""NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters."" -- Danielle Kurtzleben]

and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history of our country.

[There is recent evidence that trade with China really has contributed significantly to job losses in the U.S. One highly cited 2013 study on the China-U.S. trade relationship found that ""import competition explains one-quarter of the ... decline in U.S. manufacturing employment"" between 1990 and 2007. One of that paper's authors, David Autor, told NPR's Chris Arnold this year that that amounted to nearly 1 million jobs. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, people don't remember, in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it. And the havoc it wreaked after he left office was unbelievable.

[As noted by the Washington Post, more Republicans than Democrats supported NAFTA at the time of its approval. — Sarah McCammon [Also, as the Post's Glenn Kessler noted, NAFTA was negotiated under George H.W. Bush, not Clinton, and Bush signed it. As this 1992 article from the Baltimore Sun explains, that signing set the stage for Congress to vote the deal up or down. Clinton later signed it into law, after the three countries ratified it. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China's disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible, terrible agreement.

Then, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.

And I've been talking about China for many years. And you know what? Nobody listened. But they're listening now, that I can tell you.

The city of Pittsburgh, and the state of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO. Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time. And this factory, because of your great owners Gabe and Gloria, it's hanging in. Hanging in. But they just told me, it's not easy.

Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world and it's the result of trade with China. It was also Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea.

As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs. As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton ""voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions, of jobs.""

Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back to our country. To understand why trade reform creates jobs, and it creates a lot of them, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper.

Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product. From 1947 to 2001 — a span of over five decades — our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5 percent.

However, since 2002 — the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports — that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.

[There was also a major recession between 2002 and today — one that trade with China didn't cause. In addition, there was strong growth in some of those years. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

What does this mean for Americans? Not good. For every 1 percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over 1 million jobs. What a waste. And what a sad, sad thing.

[Trump has favored other policies, like Brexit and his economic plans, which experts have said could potentially hold back U.S. economic growth. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

America's job creation deficit, due to slower growth since 2002, is well over 20 million jobs — and that's just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages. Wages are very low because there's no competition and they're going to go up because we're going to thrive again as a country.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership is the greatest danger yet.

[Earlier this year, the U.S. International Trade Commission projected the TPP would have a modest net benefit to the U.S. economy by boosting the agriculture and the service sectors, though it would very likely depress manufacturing slightly, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. As the Journal wrote, ""If anything, the The ITC report and other reviews by economists show the deal's impact of the TPP is likely to be extremely small on the overall U.S. economy and most industries."" — Sarah McCammon]

The TPP, as it's known, would be the death blow for American manufacturing. It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own.

It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters. Cheaters. That's what they are, cheaters. They're not playing by the rules. They're cheating.

It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets — while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports. Which is what they do. It's very hard to export to their countries. They make it very difficult. We, on the other hand, come on in everybody, come on in. Bad leadership.

The TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas. That's not all, mark my words. China will enter the TPP through the back door at a later date. They are watching; they are studying. They're not it in now, but they're gonna be in it. If it's good, they'll be there. By the way, if it's no good, they'll pass. It's the same way. Always is.

The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest-wage countries on Earth.

Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence. That's what's happened. The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto.

These commissions are Great Hillary Clinton's Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the outcomes. It should be no surprise, then, that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a ""leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" Please remember that. Especially in November.

She praised or even pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the ""gold standard.""

Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too — and I will tell you, it was the same shame that she had recently when she was sort of forced into saying ""radical Islamic terrorism"" which she didn't want to say, but she was shamed into that one. But have no doubt that she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, and that is guaranteed. Guaranteed.

She will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career. Her whole career she has betrayed the American worker. She's trying to put on a good front now. She will betray you again. Her career and her husband have signed so many disasters. And never ever forget NAFTA. Just never ever forget it, because you know what it's done and I know what it's done. And in touring I've seen the devastation that it's left behind.

Here's how it would go: She would make a small token change, declare the TPP pact fixed, and ram it through. And you will suffer.

That's why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP ""in its current form"" — you know what that means. That means like they'll make a little two-word change, and she'll fix it and she'll feel great. But she says in its current form — she will rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity.

If the media doesn't believe me, I have a challenge for you and Hillary. Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form.

There is no way to fix TPP. We need bilateral trade deals. We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down. Like TPP does.

A Trump administration will change our failed trade policies, and I mean quickly.

Here are seven steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs:

No. 1: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.

[No. 2] I'm going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.

[No. 3] I'm going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm you, the American workers. I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses. And abuse is the right word.

No. 4: I'm going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot, not just a little, by a lot for our workers. And if they do not agree to a renegotiation, which they might not because they're so used to having their own way. Not with Trump, they won't have their own way. Then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.

No. 5: I am going to instruct my Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Which should've been done years ago. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the United States, which is many countries, will be met with sharply. And that includes taxes and tariffs.

[This promise sounds a bit recycled, like those aluminum cans behind the candidate. Mitt Romney also promised to label China a currency manipulator in 2012. For that matter, so did Barack Obama in 2008. — Scott Horsley]

No. 6: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules and regulations and basically, I intend to enforce the agreements for all countries, including China.

[No.] 7: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential — hey look this is very easy, this is so easy. I love saying this — I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

And when they say trade expansion, they're talking about other countries, they're not talking about us, because there is no expansion. They get the expansion, we get the joblessness. That's the way it works. Not going to happen anymore.

President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry. I remember. His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45 percent and his tariff to shield America's semiconductor industry was 100 percent. And that had a big impact, folks. A big impact.

Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war. She has it completely backwards.

Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another — from NAFTA to China to South Korea.

[Trump isn't just disagreeing with Clinton's policies. Powerful right-leaning groups like the Chamber of Commerce also disagree with him. The chamber reacted to Trump's speech with tweets saying that Trump's plans would cost jobs and that NAFTA has been good for the economy. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

It doesn't matter, no matter where she went, the American worker was hurt and you will be hurt worse than ever before if she becomes president of the United States. That I can tell you.

A Trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people. And the American worker. The era of economic surrender will finally be over. It will be over. You're not going to see it anymore. Although, I can't guarantee it, because after me they're probably [going to] start doing it again. But we will have have four, maybe eight great, great, great productive years. And we'll never go back and we'll make sure we never go back.

A new era of prosperity will finally begin.

America will be independent once more. Independent once more. Doesn't that sound great?

Under a Trump presidency, the American worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them. We will stand up to trade cheating — cheating, cheaters, that's what they are. Cheaters. We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens the American job.

We will make America the best place in the world to start a business, we'll hire workers, and we'll open factories. And we'll get rid of these horrible regulations that make it impossible to do business in this country. This will also include massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses.

We will also get rid of all of these rules, and all of these problems, and all of the bureaucracy, which are destroying, absolutely destroying our job creation capacity, which we use to be the best in the world. And now we're getting close to the bottom, folks. We're getting close to the bottom.

Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. We are also going to fully capture America's tremendous energy capacity. This will create, for our workers, and that's what we want, for our workers, growth for our economy and [to] begin reducing our budget deficits, which are massive. Yearly budget deficit, massive.

Our trade deficits, we don't even want to talk about it. Our budget deficits are massive. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines. And she wants to shut down, and she said it just recently, she wants to shut down the miners. I want to do exactly the opposite.

[Here's what Hillary Clinton actually said about coal mining jobs. — Scott Horsley]

A Trump administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure. And aluminum. Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State Building. That's what we're going to do. It built the Empire State Building. It will be American steel that will fortify America's crumbling bridges. American steel.

It will be American steel. It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring, soaring into the sky. Beautiful sight. More beautiful with American steel. It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities. It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy — mined from American resources — that powers this country.

It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. Nobody else. American workers. We are going to put American-produced steel and aluminum back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs. High-paying jobs. Good jobs. Not the jobs we have today, which everybody agrees are bad jobs. We're going to create [a] massive number of good jobs. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America first again.

We are going to make America wealthy again. We are going to reject Hillary Clinton's policy of fear, and her policy of absolute nonsense, because it's not working. And it's grossly incompetent, and we can't take it any longer and we're not going to take it any longer. We are going to embrace the possibilities of change. But real change — not Obama change.

It is time to believe in the future. It is time to believe in each other. It is time to believe In America again. This is how we are going to make America great again — for all Americans. For all Americans. We are going to make America great again for everyone — greater than ever before.

And I promise you, if I become president, we are going to be working again. We are going to have great jobs again. You're going to be so happy. You're going to be proud of your president. You're going to be proud, proud, proud of our country once again. Thank you."
401,Trump Was Stronger Where The Economy Is Weaker - FiveThirtyEight,Trump Was Stronger Where The Economy Is Weaker  FiveThirtyEight,"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZml2ZXRoaXJ0eWVpZ2h0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy90cnVtcC13YXMtc3Ryb25nZXItd2hlcmUtdGhlLWVjb25vbXktaXMtd2Vha2VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,FiveThirtyEight,"Donald Trump performed best on Tuesday in places where the economy is in worse shape, and especially in places where jobs are most at risk in the future.

Trump, who in his campaign pledged to be a voice for “forgotten Americans,” beat Hillary Clinton in counties with slower job growth and lower wages. And he far outperformed her in counties where more jobs are threatened by automation or offshoring, a sign that he found support not just among workers who are struggling now but among those concerned for their economic future.

In the months leading up to Tuesday’s vote, experts debated how much Trump’s support was driven by economic anxiety or by racism, xenophobia or other factors. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, of course, and the debate will continue long into Trump’s presidency. But county-level voting results suggest that economic issues underpinned at least some of Trump’s support.

The relationship between economic issues and Trump’s support is not straightforward. Earlier analyses, based on pre-election polls, suggested that Trump’s backers were wealthier on average than Clinton’s. Actual election results show no correlation between counties’ September 2016 unemployment rates and their level of support for Trump — places with higher unemployment rates were no more likely to vote for Trump than those with lower rates. (County-level voting data is provided by Dave Leip’s U.S. Election Atlas. These figures are from version 0.2, which are preliminary, contain omissions and possibly errors and will be revised.)

Unemployment, however, is a crude measure of a local economy. The government’s official definition of unemployment ignores people who have stopped looking for work or who have moved away altogether, and it doesn’t distinguish between a full-time job at a factory and a part-time job at a fast-food restaurant. Measures that do account for these factors generally suggest a stronger relationship between the economy and Trump’s support. Counties with weaker job growth since 2012, for example, were more likely to support Trump; the same is true for places with lower average earnings among full-time workers.

Economic anxiety is about the future, not just the present. Trump beat Clinton in counties where more jobs are at risk because of technology or globalization. Specifically, counties with the most “routine” jobs — those in manufacturing, sales, clerical work and related occupations that are easier to automate or send offshore — were far more likely to vote for Trump.

Comparing Trump’s vote share and other variables can only take us so far, however. For the most part, Trump did better in places that typically vote Republican — there is a strong correlation between how Trump performed in 2016 and how Mitt Romney performed four years earlier. So if routine jobs tend to be concentrated in Republican-leaning areas — as I found a few months ago — that doesn’t necessarily reveal much about whether economic anxiety fueled Trump’s support, in particular.

Instead, to understand what drove Trump’s victory, we can look at how Trump’s margin against Clinton in 2016 compared with Romney’s against President Obama in 2012. Sure enough, the swing toward Trump was much stronger in counties with a higher share of routine jobs; the swing toward Trump was also stronger where unemployment was higher, job growth was slower and earnings were lower.

Demographic factors such as age, race and immigrant share also correlate with the swing toward Trump, although among these only age correlates as strongly as routine job share. However, it’s nearly impossible to disentangle economic factors from other explanations for Trump’s victory because demographic characteristics and economic conditions are themselves related: Counties with older populations tend to have higher unemployment, slower job growth and a higher routine-job share. And some measures are clearly intertwined with both economic and social issues. For instance, counties where more adults are college educated have dramatically higher earnings and a lower routine-job share, but also lots of other favorable social, health and economic outcomes.

Still, it is clear that the places that voted for Trump are under greater economic stress, and the places that swung most toward Trump are those where jobs are most under threat. Importantly, Trump’s appeal was strongest in places where people are most concerned about what the future will mean for their jobs, even if those aren’t the places where economic conditions are worst today."

For Trump’s supporters he represents a chance to shake up a system that many Americans feel has increased inequality and squeezed living standards. For less complacent investors, there are worries Trump’s anti-globalisation mantra will spread protectionism around the world, put up trade barriers and curb global economic growth. Furthermore, markets do not like unknowns and with Trump going to the White House they are dealing with a complete newcomer to politics. His administration is widely expected to mark a departure from the policies of his own Republican party as well as the outgoing Democrats.

So what do we know about Trump’s economic policies? We look at the key areas:

Trade

Tapping into economic discontent Trump has argued for protectionism and asserted that decades of free-trade policies were responsible for the collapse of the American manufacturing industry. He has been feeding on the perception among many Americans that globalisation has brought more pain than gain, for example, by bringing cheap consumer goods into the country, costing domestic jobs and depressing wages. Outsourcing of jobs to cheaper markets has also been a concern. Against that backdrop, Trump’s stance on trade is perhaps the clearest of his economic policies.

The billionaire Republican wants to renegotiate, or possibly even scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nafta lowers trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico and was negotiated by George HW Bush and enacted in the 1990s by Bill Clinton. The incoming president wants Nafta to offer a better deal for Americans and has rejected claims by his opponents that the deal has helped the US economy by opening up export markets.

The protectionism with regard to Mexico does not stop there. One of Trump’s most notorious pledges in the presidential campaign was to build a multibillion-dollar wall along the US southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. On the markets on Wednesday fears over the blow to Mthe Mexican economy from Trump’s victory have sent the peso plummeting.

Other global trade deals are also now very much in doubt, notably the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim, excluding China, and the agreement being negotiated between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).

In terms of trade deals, both TTIP and the TPP now look dead in the water

Philip Shaw, an economist at the bank Investec, says: “While we are minded to disregard some of Mr Trump’s wilder pre-election rhetoric, we consider that there is a tangible risk that a Trump presidency could fuel anti-globalisation momentum and spark a wave of protectionist policies around the globe. In terms of trade deals, both TTIP and the TPP now look dead in the water.”

Trump has also made his anger with China over trade well known, arguing that since China joined the World Trade Organisation, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. He wants the US government to label China a “currency manipulator” and has lambasted the rapidly growing Asian economy for “unfair subsidy behaviour”.

Taxes

Here again, Trump has played into frustrations among many Americans over their sense of financial insecurity, inequality and squeezed incomes. Trump, who has faced fierce criticism for appearing to escape paying income tax himself for almost two decades, promised tax cuts for all income groups.



He has pledged “a massive tax reduction” for working and middle-income Americans and has vowed to eliminate income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. He has also said he would “ensure the rich pay their fair share”. But analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation has found Trump’s tax plan would disproportionately help the richest Americans, saving them millions.

Trump has also supported lower corporate taxes, proposing to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15%. He wants to close special interest tax loopholes and to restrict companies from moving money out of the country. He has also proposed a corporate tax repatriation plan – to encourage US companies which hoard cash overseas to avoid paying the 35% tax to bring that cash back to the US. According to Capital Economics this cash hoard is now $2.5tn. A tax holiday – so the tax due would be only 10% for a period – could encourage corporations to bring back cash to invest or distribute to shareholders

Public finances

All those tax cuts mean less coming in to government coffers, at least in the near-term. There is an argument that the potential boost to businesses and to household spending power would lift the economy enough to improve government finances. But, for now, economists expect that Trump’s plans for tax cuts across the board will mean the US taking on more debt as its deficit – the gap between spending and income – swells.

Kevin Logan, the chief US economist at the bank HSBC, says: “Reducing the budget deficits, while cutting tax rates at the same time, will be difficult without sizable cutbacks in federal spending. If a Trump administration manages to push through tax cuts with matching spending cuts, federal budget deficits, which are already trending higher, will probably increase substantially, in our view.”

Obamacare

Trump wants to repeal and replace president Barack Obama’s healthcare plan, introduced under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with his own, cheaper plan for tax-free health savings accounts (HSAs). On the campaign trail, Trump called Obamacare an expensive “disaster”.

About 20 million more people have insurance thanks to the ACA but the scheme has struggled to run efficiently because it relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that competition has dwindled.



Immigration

The most high-profile Trump plan on immigration is for a wall along the Mexican border. He also said he would deport 11 million undocumented migrants, something opponents say is physically impossible. He wants immigrants to be selected on the basis of “their likelihood of success in the US and their ability to be financially self-sufficient”.

Jobs and growth

Unemployment in the US has dropped below 5%, a good record on the surface for Obama. But during his campaign, Trump has focused on those parts of the economy and country where the recovery since the financial crash has not being felt, gaining traction with those Americans who have seen their industries diminish and their wages stagnate.

On the campaign trail, Trump chose the once booming industrial centre of Detroit to set out his economic plan. He cited the motor city’s higher-than-average unemployment rate and crime levels in a speech that played on widespread worries about the decline of US manufacturing.

Trump has said his protectionist policies will keep “jobs and wealth inside the United States” . He has promised to increase employment, saying his plans for lower taxes, trade barriers and tighter immigration rules would lead to stronger economic growth. As with the deficit, many economists warn his plans could make things worse not better, hindering economic growth and thereby employers’ ability to create new jobs.

Trump has bemoaned the deteriorating conditions of American infrastructure but has provided little detail on what big spending projects he would undertake. In his victory speech he said: “We are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure ... and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.”

Interest rates

This is not strictly an area for the government, given interest rates are set by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, widely referred to as the Fed. But there were worries during the presidential race that a win for Trump would undermine its independence and the position of its chairwoman, Janet Yellen.

The president-elect has previously accused the Fed of keeping borrowing costs low to help president Obama and has said the central bank’s policies have created a “false economy”.

In April he said he would be inclined to replace Yellen. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Trump also said he “absolutely” backed efforts to diminish the Fed’s power. Yellen began a four-year term as Fed chairwoman under Obama in February 2014.

Fed policymakers had hinted at another rate rise in December, part of the slow process of bringing policy back to more normal levels after drastic measures to shore up the US economy during the global financial crisis. But investors now think a move next month is off the table given the shock to markets from Trump’s victory and the economic uncertainty that lies ahead.



In the longer-term, more spending and tax cuts from the government – in other words looser fiscal policy – could usher in tighter monetary policy with a more interest rate hikes from the Fed.

Climate change

Trump’s victory has sparked alarm and dismay among environmentalists fearful he will reverse many of the green measures introduced under Obama. Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the UK’s Green party, described the Republican’s win as “a hammer blow for the fight against climate change”.

In the past the real estate mogul has dismissed global warming as an “expensive hoax”. Now his election to the US presidency has thrown the historic Paris agreement into uncertainty just days after it officially came into force. Trump has threatened to to withdraw the US from the deal to cut greenhouse gases, which took 20 years to negotiate.

By contrast, Trump has indicated he would promote coal, shale gas and oil and there are worries he will curb investment into renewable energy sources as well as funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. He has pledged to scrap regulations for America’s coal industry, a stance that won him the beleaguered sector’s support. It gave around $223,000 in support of Trump, compared with none for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters analysis."

Registered voters prefer Clinton to Trump on education, foreign affairs

Young adults choose Clinton over Trump on nearly all issues

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- With the presidential election less than two months away, U.S. registered voters say Donald Trump is better able to handle economic issues -- such as employment and taxes -- than Hillary Clinton. However, these voters see Clinton as better suited than Trump on issues such as the treatment of minority groups, social issues, foreign affairs, education and immigration. Overall, of the 17 issues that Gallup asked registered voters about, Clinton leads Trump on 10.

Registered Voters' Perceptions of Which Candidate Is Best Able to Handle Key Issues Regardless of which presidential candidate you support, please tell me if you think Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would better handle each of the following issues.

While Clinton leads Trump on only three more issues total (10 for Clinton, seven for Trump), her average advantage far outpaces his. Clinton leads by an average of 19 percentage points, while Trump's average advantage is seven points.

The disparity in leads between Clinton and Trump in these policy spheres exceeds the gap between the major-party candidates in the two most recent presidential elections. In September 2008, John McCain led Barack Obama on six issues by an average of 12 points, while Obama led McCain on four issues by an average of nine points. In September 2012, Obama led Mitt Romney on seven issues by an average of 11 points -- driven largely by a 26-point advantage on social issues -- whereas Romney's lead on two issues averaged nine points.

Trump Weaker Among Republicans Than Clinton Is Among Democrats

Trump receives less support on these policy issues among registered Republicans than Clinton receives among registered Democrats. Republicans choose Trump over Clinton by an average of 71 points. Meanwhile, Clinton's advantage over Trump among Democrats across all policy spheres averages 81 points.

Among registered Republicans, Trump receives especially weak support on social issues, the treatment of minorities and climate change -- issues on which about three in 10 Republicans say Clinton is better suited. On economic issues -- such as taxes, the economy and the federal budget deficit -- Trump scores especially strongly among his political compatriots, with almost nine in 10 Republicans preferring him to Clinton.

Clinton's weakest point among registered Democrats is on the issue of government regulation of Wall Street and banks, on which slightly less than one-fifth of Democrats prefer Trump. However, in all other policy spheres, no fewer than eight in 10 Democrats say Clinton would be better able than Trump to handle the issue.

Independents strongly prefer Clinton to Trump on the treatment of minority groups in the U.S. (+41), climate change (+38), social issues (+37) and foreign affairs (+33). On immigration -- an issue central to Trump's campaign -- independents choose Clinton over Trump.

Trump's advantages over Clinton among independents reflect some of his strongest issues among Republicans. He leads Clinton on the budget deficit (+21), gun policy (+21) and government regulation of Wall Street (+20). However, on issues where Trump leads Clinton among independents, he averages a 15-point advantage, compared with Clinton's 22-point average advantage on issues where she leads.

Clinton Leads Trump on Nearly All Issues Among Young Americans

Both campaigns have struggled to resonate with young Americans, as both candidates' favorable ratings are lowest among young voters. When 18- to 34-year-olds are asked which candidate they believe to be best suited to handle particular policy issues, younger voters largely prefer Clinton over Trump. For issues on which Clinton leads, her advantage averages 31 points. In fact, young adults choose Clinton over Trump on nearly all issues that Gallup asks about. The only issue where young voters choose Trump over Clinton is on the regulation of Wall Street and banks (+7).

Bottom Line

Americans cite the economy and unemployment as some of the most important problems facing the country. While Trump leads Clinton among registered voters in terms of which candidate can best handle these issues, his advantage is relatively small. And among young adults, Clinton leads Trump by seven or eight points on these issues.

Trump, meanwhile, continues to emphasize his stance on immigration. ""Immigration"" is still one of the most frequently used words Americans use to describe what they've recently heard about Trump. However, registered voters overall and independents prefer Clinton to Trump on the immigration issue by margins of 13 and 10 points, respectively.

Overall, 84% of registered voters say that the issue of the economy will be very important to them in making their decision about who to vote for in the 2016 presidential election; slightly fewer (80%) say the issue of terrorism will be very important to their vote. In 2008, far more said the economy would be very important to their vote (87%) than the issue of terrorism (68%).

Other issues that rank highly on voters’ 2016 importance list include foreign policy (75% very important), health care (74%), gun policy (72%) and immigration (70%).

With an open seat on the Supreme Court, 65% say appointments to the nation’s highest court will be a very important factor in their decision this fall. About as many (63%) say the issue of how racial and ethnic minorities are treated will be very important to their vote.

Fewer than half of voters see abortion (45%) or the treatment of gay, lesbian and transgender people (40%) as very important to their vote.

Among Trump supporters, 90% call the economy very important to their vote and 89% say the same about the issue of terrorism. Other issues given high priority by Trump supporters include immigration (79%) and foreign policy (79%).

Large majorities of Clinton supporters also see the economy (80%) and terrorism (74%) as very important issues to their vote. Another top issue for Clinton supporters is how racial and ethnic minorities are treated: 79% of Clinton supporters say this is very important to their vote compared with just 42% of Trump backers who say the same. Clinton backers are somewhat less likely than Trump supporters to say immigration will be very important to their 2016 decision (65% vs 79%).

Comparable shares of Clinton (74%) and Trump (71%) supporters say the issue of gun policy will be very important to their vote. In 2012 and 2004, far fewer supporters of either the Republican or Democratic candidate said the issue of “gun control” was very important to their vote.

While the environment ranks relatively low among all voters as a 2016 issue, Clinton supporters are much more likely to say it is very important to their vote (69%) than are Trump supporters (32%).

Similarly, more Clinton (54%) than Trump (25%) backers say the issue of how gay, lesbian and transgender people are treated will be very important to their 2016 decision.

Across age groups, there are varying perspectives on the importance of issues in voting decisions.

Older Americans are much more likely than younger adults to say the issue of Supreme Court appointments and Social Security will be very important to their 2016 decision. About three-quarters of those 50-64 and 65 or older (74% each) say court appointments will be very important, compared with 60% of those 30-49 and just 45% of those under 30.

On the issue of Social Security, 78% of those 65 and older and 75% 0f those 50-64 say this will be very important to their 2016 decision, compared with 58% of those 30-49 and 57% of those 18-29.

Large majorities of those 65 or older (86%) and 50-64 (85%) say terrorism is a very important issue to their vote; somewhat smaller majorities of those ages 30-49 (77%) and 18-29 (68%) say the same.

Younger adults place greater importance than older adults on two issues: The treatment of racial and ethnic minorities and the treatment of gay, lesbian and transgender people. About three-quarters of those under 30 (74%) say the treatment of minorities is a very important issue to their vote, compared with 56% of those 65 and older. The issue of how gay, lesbian and transgender people are treated is a lower-tier issue across groups, but those under 30 (50%) are more likely than those over 65 (32%) to say it will be a very important issue in deciding how to vote this fall.

While a number of top issues, such as the economy, have been rated consistently high over the course of last several election cycles, immigration is an issue that has grown in importance. In the current survey, 70% of registered voters say immigration is very important to their vote for president in 2016, up from 41% in September 2012 and 54% in May 2008.

The increase in importance given to immigration has occurred among both Republicans and Democrats – though Republicans have consistently been somewhat more likely than Democrats to call it a very important issue to their vote.

Overall, 77% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters and 65% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say immigration is very important to their 2016 decision. Four years ago, 47% of Republicans and 37% of Democrats said this. In 2008 (when the issue was more salient to voters than in 2012), 64% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats said immigration was a very important issue in their vote choice.

Conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are both more likely than other members of their respective parties to call the issues of Supreme Court appointments and abortion very important to their 2016 decision.

About three-quarters of conservative Republicans and Republican leaners (77%) say the issue of Supreme Court appointments will be very important to their vote, compared with fewer (56%) moderate and liberal Republicans and leaners.

Similarly, among Democrats and Democratic leaners, more liberals (69%) than moderates and conservatives (57%) see court appointments as very important to their 2016 vote.

The same pattern is seen on the issue of abortion: 47% of conservative Republicans say abortion is a very important issue to their vote in 2016, compared with 31% of moderate and liberal Republicans.

About half of liberal Democrats (52%) say abortion will be very important to their 2016 decision; 42% of conservative and moderate Democrats say the same.

When it comes to which candidate would do the better job handling key issues, voters give the edge to Clinton over Trump in several areas, including making wise foreign policy decisions and dealing with immigration.

But while Clinton is seen as having the edge over Trump on a greater number of the issues included in the survey, Trump holds a narrow advantage over Clinton when it comes to improving economic conditions and defending the country from future terrorist attacks – two issues voters place near the top of their importance list.

Voters overwhelming say Clinton would do a better job dealing with race relations than Trump (66% vs. 26%) – the widest issue advantage for either candidate. Clinton also holds a wide advantage over Trump when it comes to the candidate who could better reflect voters’ views on abortion (53%-30%) and deal with health care (54%-37%). By almost 20 points, more voters say Clinton would be better at making wise foreign policy decisions than Trump (54%-36%). On the issue of immigration – an area where Trump has made a series of controversial comments – 51% of voters say Clinton would do the better job compared with fewer (42%) who say Trump would do better.

With a current vacancy on the Supreme Court, 52% say Clinton would do better selecting Supreme Court justices, compared with 40% who think Trump would have the better approach.

On trade policy, an issue that featured prominently in both parties’ primary campaigns, neither candidate enjoys a significant advantage: 48% of voters say Clinton would do better making wise decisions on trade compared with 46% who say Trump. Similarly, no candidate has a significant edge on gun policy – an issue that has received renewed attention in the wake of the nightclub shooting in Orlando, FL: 46% of voters prefer Clinton’s approach on guns, while 45% prefer Trump’s approach.

By a 48%-43% margin, Trump holds a slight edge over Clinton as the candidate voters say would do the better job improving economic conditions. On terrorism, Trump has a similar advantage: 48% say he would do the better job preventing future attacks; 43% say Clinton would do the better job.

Trump holds a wide edge over Clinton as the candidate seen as better able to reduce the influence of lobbyists and special interest groups in Washington: 50% think Trump would do the better job, while just 30% say Clinton would; 16% of voters volunteer that “neither” would do the better job reducing special interest influence in Washington.

In part, Trump’s overall deficit on select issues reflects some skepticism from Republican and Republican leaning registered voters – particularly those who preferred another candidate in the GOP primary.

Overall, 53% of Republicans and Republican leaners say Trump would do the better job dealing with race relations, while 36% say Clinton would do the better job and 11% volunteer that neither would or that they don’t know. Among Republicans who say they supported a candidate other than Donald Trump in the GOP primary, more say Clinton (51%) than Trump (34%) would do the better job on race relations.

Majorities of Republicans and leaners say Trump would do the better job than Clinton dealing with immigration (80%) and foreign policy (70%); Republicans who did not support Trump in the primary are 28 points less likely than those who did to say he would do the better job on immigration and 33 points less likely than GOP Trump primary backers to say he would do a better job than Clinton making wise foreign policy decisions.

Among Democrats, confidence in Clinton is lowest when it comes to reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interest groups in Washington. Overall, 52% of Democratic and Democratic leaning registered voters think Clinton would do the better job on this issue, while 24% say Donald Trump would do the better job and 20% volunteer that neither would. About four-in-ten Democrats who supported Clinton in the Democratic primary are not sure she would be the best candidate to reduce the influence of lobbyists and special interests: 57% say she would do the better job on this issue, while 22% say Trump would do better and 16% volunteer that neither would. Views among Democrats who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary are little different: 46% think Clinton would do the better job, while 27% think Trump would and 23% volunteer that neither would.

The gaps between Democrats who supported Clinton in the primary and those who supported Sanders are wider when it comes to which candidate would do better defending the country from future terrorist attacks and improving economic conditions. On the economy, 86% of Democrats who preferred Clinton in the primaries say she would do a better job than Trump compared with a smaller majority (68%) of Democrats who supported Sanders. Similarly, nearly nine-in-ten (87%) Democrats who backed Clinton in the primaries say she would do the better job defending the country from future terrorist attacks; 60% of those who supported Sanders say the same."

In a far-ranging interview and town-hall event with PBS NewsHour in Elkhart, Obama touted the economic gains seen under his watch in hard-hit counties like Elkhart, where the unemployment rate soared to nearly 20 percent soon after he took office.

Unemployment in the county, which the Obama administration used as a touchstone early on to gauge its economic recovery plan, now stands at roughly four percent.

“We’re going to have to make sure that we make some good decisions going forward, but the notion that somehow America is in decline is just not born out by the facts.”

“We’re going to have to make sure that we make some good decisions going forward, but the notion that somehow America is in decline is just not born out by the facts,” Obama said in an interview with the NewsHour’s Gwen Ifill.

Nevertheless, in the interview and a town hall held immediately after in downtown Elkhart, the president acknowledged that many people around the country remain worried about making ends meet.

“Even though we’ve recovered, people feel like the ground under their feet isn’t quite as solid,” Obama said. “If they’re feeling insecure, and they’re offered a simple reason to be more secure, people are going to be tempted by it.”

The comment was clearly aimed at Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump’s populist economic message has energized millions of voters, but his critics — including Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee — have long argued that Trump does not have the experience or gravity to lead the country.

The president declined to invoke the real estate mogul’s full name, saying that he would let Trump “do his advertising for him.”

But Obama criticized Trump’s claims that he could use his business acumen to spur economic growth and tackle other complex issues.

“He just says, ‘I’m gonna negotiate a better deal.’ Well how? How exactly are you going to negotiate that?” Obama said during the town hall portion of the event. “What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn’t have an answer.”

The remarks were a preview of Obama’s likely line of attack later this summer, when he plans to head out on the road to campaign for the Democratic nominee. But while Obama touched on the 2016 presidential election, he spent the bulk of the town hall addressing Elkhart residents’ concerns about the pace of the economic recovery.

“He just says, ‘I’m gonna negotiate a better deal.’ Well how? How exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn’t have an answer.”

Obama first came to Elkhart County in May 2008, during his presidential campaign. At the time of his visit, the county’s unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent. The president returned later that year, after securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and gave a speech vowing to spur economic growth in the region.

But the local economy took a nosedive soon after. By the time of Obama’s next visit, in February 2009, the county’s unemployment rate had shot up to 20 percent, making Elkhart a symbol of the many communities struggling to cope with the Great Recession.

Obama used that trip, his first as president outside of Washington, D.C., to make a last-minute push for the stimulus bill, a proposed package of federal spending and tax cuts aimed at reviving the economy.

In August 2009, after Congress passed the $787 billion recovery plan, Obama returned to Elkhart for the fourth time to announce stimulus funding for Indiana. The president also used the trip to push back against Republicans who argued that the stimulus plan wasn’t working.

Most economists now credit the stimulus bill with helping avert a deeper recession. The bill is often cited by Obama supporters as one of the president’s most important achievements. But Republican attacks on the recovery plan never stopped.

And the recovery in Elkhart has been uneven. After several years of slow but steady growth, the recreational vehicle manufacturing industry, which is based in Elkhart and anchors the regional economy, is back in full swing.

“Right now, things are going very well. We’ve gone from high unemployment to having jobs we can’t fill,” said Kyle Hannon, the president of the Elkhart Chamber of Commerce.

Victoria Bowen, a lifelong Elkhart resident who works at an RV factory, said she was struck by the number of help wanted signs around the town, just a few years after many businesses were shutting down or laying off workers.

“That means the economy is going again,” Bowen said, adding that she credits Obama for the city’s resurgence. “The economy was down, and he brought it back. I think Obama has done a good job.”

But others scoffed at the notion that Elkhart had recovered, and criticized Obama for not doing enough to create new jobs.

“He’s come to Elkhart a few times, and it seems like he’s done nothing to try and make things better,” said Steven Good, a homeless man who has struggled to find housing and work in the area. “He made lots of announcements but they were just words. Empty promises.”

Conversations with residents across the city revealed a racial divide, in particular among white conservatives who said they disliked the president and African-Americans, like Bowen, who are Democrats and support Obama.

The divide mirrored nationwide surveys that show more than 80 percent of blacks approve of the job Obama is doing. In contrast, his approval rating among whites has been stuck below 50 percent for the past several years.

More broadly, opinions of Obama in Elkhart broke down largely along partisan lines, with most Democrats in interviews expressing support for the president and most Republicans opposing his economic policies.

“Politicians get the most attention the more outrageous they sound. So if you’re civil and quiet and polite, nobody covers you. But if you say something crazy and rude you’re all over the news.”

Obama focused on his record in the PBS NewsHour town hall, and has used other interviews this year to burnish his legacy in the final months before he leaves office. But as Hannon noted, arguments over Obama’s legacy will continue long after he departs the White House.

“It’s going to take several years for that legacy to settle in,” Hannon said.

In the short term, Obama’s popularity in places like Elkhart could help determine the presidential election.

Trump will need to perform well in states across the Midwest in order to beat Clinton in the fall. Obama carried Indiana in the 2008 general election, becoming the first Democratic candidate to win the state since 1964. But Obama lost Indiana to Mitt Romney by 10 points in 2012, and the state is leaning Republican this year as well.

Trump won the GOP primary in Indiana by nearly 20 points last month, forcing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich out of the race.

At the NewsHour town hall, Obama said there would be “plenty of time” for him to campaign for Trump’s opponent once the last major primaries take place next Tuesday.

“There’s been a healthy debate in the Democratic primary, and it’s almost over,” Obama said. “I think we’ll probably have a pretty good sense next week of who the nominee is going to be.”

Clinton has a large delegate lead over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but Sanders won several states last month and could be competitive in California, which awards the bulk of the remaining pledged delegates, next week.

Obama appeared eager to take on Trump, though he lamented the culture of modern-day campaigning.

“Politicians get the most attention the more outrageous they sound. So if you’re civil and quiet and polite, nobody covers you. But if you say something crazy and rude you’re all over the news,” Obama said.

He added, “that has fed this kind of arms race of insults and controversy that doesn’t shed a lot of light even though it generates a lot of heat.”

Whatever happens statewide in November, Elkhart County will likely wind up in the Republican column. The county has voted for the Republican candidate in the past four presidential races.

“This is a very, very Republican county,” Hannon said. “And that might be part of the reason why Obama doesn’t get a lot of credit around here.”

408,Donald Trump lost most of the American economy in this election - The Washington Post,Donald Trump lost most of the American economy in this election  The Washington Post,"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvbmsvd3AvMjAxNi8xMS8yMi9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbG9zdC1tb3N0LW9mLXRoZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1lY29ub215LWluLXRoaXMtZWxlY3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"In the modern era of presidential politics, no candidate has ever won the popular vote by more than Hillary Clinton did this year, yet still managed to lose the electoral college. In that sense, 2016 was a historic split: Donald Trump won the presidency by as much as 74 electoral votes (depending on how Michigan ends up) while losing the nationwide vote to Clinton by 1.7 million votes and counting.

But there's another divide exposed by the election, which researchers at the Brookings Institution recently discovered as they sifted the election returns. It has no bearing on the election outcome, but it tells us something important about the state of the country and its politics moving forward.

The divide is economic, and it is massive. According to the Brookings analysis, the less-than-500 counties that Clinton won nationwide combined to generate 64 percent of America's economic activity in 2015. The more-than-2,600 counties that Trump won combined to generate 36 percent of the country's economic activity last year.

Clinton, in other words, carried nearly two-thirds of the American economy.

Here's how the researchers, at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, visualized that. You can see immediately what's going on: With the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas, and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized economic county in the country.

This appears to be unprecedented, in the era of modern economic statistics, for a losing presidential candidate. The last candidate to win the popular vote but lose the electoral college, Democrat Al Gore in 2000, won counties that generated about 54 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the Brookings researchers calculated. That's true even though Gore won more than 100 more counties in 2000 than Clinton did in 2016.

In between those elections, U.S. economic activity has grown increasingly concentrated in large, “superstar” metro areas, such as Silicon Valley and New York.

But it's not the case that the counties Clinton won have grown richer at the expense of the rest of the country — they represent about the same share of the economy today as they did in 2000. Instead, it appears that, compared to Gore, Clinton was much more successful in winning over the most successful counties in a geographically unbalanced economy.

The Brookings analysis found that counties with higher GDP per capita were more likely to vote for Clinton over Trump, as were counties with higher population density. Counties with a higher share of manufacturing employment were more likely to vote for Trump.

“This is a picture of a very polarized and increasingly concentrated economy,” said Mark Muro, the policy director at the Brookings metro program, “with the Democratic base aligning more to that more concentrated modern economy, but a lot of votes and anger to be had in the rest of the country.”

As Muro notes, many state legislatures are divided on similar grounds, between higher-output metro areas and lower-output rural ones. Often, that divide pushes governors of those states, even the ones who hail from cities, to push hard for economic development in lower-output areas. Such a dynamic could be an upside under a president who won votes representing only a third of the country's economy — to respond to his voters, Trump could push policies to help those areas adapt more rapidly to the changing economy.

There's a downside, though, for a candidate such as Trump, whose economic appeal was rooted in a promise to restore coal, manufacturing and other jobs lost in the shifts of the past several decades.

That task will be difficult, Muro has written, in part because manufacturers have grown substantially more productive in recent years, meaning they probably won't be adding millions more workers even if Trump pursues major changes in trade policy that result in more goods being made in the United States.

“The prescription isn't that helpful,” Mark said. “We're going to have a lot of questions about how to translate the political geography into actually helpful policy.”

Since this group of less educated whites represents about one third of the electorate, we need to understand why it went so heavily for Trump. Was it economics or culture?

The economic argument holds that decent paying jobs are disappearing as a result of trade, technology, and de-industrialization. With a scarcity of good jobs, many people – men in particular – have faced high rates of joblessness. Some have chosen not to work at all rather than accept very low paid jobs. Cut loose from the moorings that work and a sense of contributing provides, many of the working class have become discouraged or depressed and have turned to unhealthy behaviors, even suicide; causing a rise in mortality, as documented by Anne Case and Angus Deaton. Their health problems can be linked back to their poor economic prospects and the associated loss of meaning in their lives. Evidence for this story has been found in several economic studies. For example, a recent paper by Justin Pierce and Peter Schott shows that rising imports from China following the liberalization of trade in 2000 has led to both bad employment outcomes and rising suicide rates in the U.S. counties most affected even after carefully controlling for other possible explanations. Under these circumstances, Trump’s promise to reduce competition from trade and immigrants was the right message – or so goes the economic side of the argument.

Trump’s promise to reduce competition from trade and immigrants was the right message – or so goes the economic side of the argument.

The cultural argument is more about identity politics and lack of trust in mainstream institutions. Trump’s bigoted comments, his refusal to be deterred by elite opinion, his success in business, and his outsider status all appealed to small town and rural white Americans of modest means. They were more angry than poor. As Arthur Brooks has put it, they have lost dignity, not just income.

Evidence for the cultural side of the argument is also strong. First, there was Thomas Frank’s What’s the Matter with Kansas?, arguing that the white working class is so concerned with guns, gays, and abortion that they vote Republican despite its very negative implications for their own economic prospects. (Frank has a new book called Listen Liberal arguing strongly that the fault lies with Democrats for not paying enough attention to this group.)

More recently, several new books and articles have elaborated on the theme. The two most important, I think, are Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance and Strangers in Their Own Land by Arlie Hochschild. Both are close-up portraits of two white working class communities, one in Appalachia and one in Louisiana. They portray a group of people in rural or small town America with middling jobs and a host of problems from broken families to drug addiction but also a fierce loyalty to family, community, and church. They resent upwardly mobile minorities, immigrants, and liberal elites. And even the women in these communities believe that women should not compete with men. They hate government in almost all of its manifestations even though they are often dependent on it themselves. They are especially critical of bureaucrats who have “cushy jobs” and of people who rely on “handouts” from the government.

Hochschild’s masterful book makes clear that the conservative politics she finds in Lake Charles, Louisiana have no rational basis. It is delusional and self-defeating. As in Frank’s Kansas, people are clearly voting against their own self interest. The terrible human and natural devastation wrought by toxic chemicals in the area goes hand in hand with hatred of the EPA and a ready acceptance of wrongdoing by corporate polluters (who do at least provide jobs). She calls this “the great paradox.” What she finds is an emotional and irrational attachment to a set of conservative views, driven by Fox news and its equivalents, by resentment of elites, and by the fact that everyone else holds the same anti-government attitudes. These conservative beliefs are a comforting tribal imperative reinforced by friends, family, and neighbors.

Vance, who grew up in Appalachia, also talks about disdain for mainstream institutions and liberal elites. He emphasizes, in addition, the role of “learned helplessness,” a kind of fatalism born of having too little control over one’s life. Then there is the association of doing well in school with femininity and the breakdown of the family. A teacher he interviews says she is expected to shepherd the children in her community but complains that their parents are often wolves.

Trump spoke to these people in the heartland, not just because he was against trade and wanted to make America great again, but because in speech and attitude, he thumbed his nose at the elites. He may have been rich but his rhetoric was not polished and certainly not politically correct. Many who voted for him were clearly racist and misogynist, but perhaps less out of dislike for individual blacks or women, but because these groups and their liberal advocates are seen as asking for special privileges not available to the white working class.

There has been an outpouring of other commentary on these issues. Joan Williams talks about a class cultural gap (professionals especially are resented by the working class) and the loss of “manly dignity” in these communities. Others who have weighed in include Charles Murray, Jonathan Rothwell, Alan Krueger, Nick Eberstadt, Scott Winship, Richard Reeves, Carol Graham, and the Economist magazine. The Economist, for example, finds that markers of an unhealthy life style (obesity, heavy drinking, lack of exercise, diabetes) are a better predictor of Trump’s margin over Romney than any other variable, including lack of education (although this is a close second).

I confess to being unsure about how to interpret all of this. Of course both economics and culture matter. Indeed, they interact. So, it’s complicated. Perhaps Charles Murray is right when he argues in Coming Apart that the breakdown of the family has played a primary role. Perhaps Thomas Frank and E.J. Dionne are right that the Democratic party has fallen down on its historical commitment to the working class and that the solution is more and better jobs. (But whether the promise of better jobs would swing a lot more votes into the Democratic column, as many assume, remains unclear.) Perhaps David Brooks is right that people are lonely and sad. Probably everyone is partly right such that we shouldn’t look for simple explanations, much less simple answers. But the recent election has been a wake-up call to dig a little deeper."

Story Highlights Economic Confidence Index climbs 13 points

Index positive for the first time since March 2015

Republicans' economic outlook improves drastically

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' confidence in the U.S. economy increased sharply after the election, moving from a slightly negative evaluation (-10) to a slightly positive one (+3). Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index had been consistently negative throughout the year leading up to the election.

Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, Before and After the Election Nov 1-7 , 2016 Nov 9-13 , 2016 -10 +3 Gallup Daily Tracking

Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index is the average of two components: how Americans rate current economic conditions and whether they feel the economy is improving or getting worse. The index has a theoretical maximum of +100 if all Americans were to say the economy is doing well and improving, and a theoretical minimum of -100 if all Americans were to say the economy is doing poorly and getting worse.

The index has registered positive only a handful of times over the nine years Gallup has tracked it daily -- the most recent being March 2015. For the week of Nov. 7-13, including two pre-election and five post-election days of interviewing, the index averaged 0.

The increase in economic confidence mostly stems from Republicans' more positive views after Republican Donald Trump won the election. Gallup has previously noted that Americans view the economy through a political lens. Republicans have had a dismal view of the economy -- especially of its future direction -- during Democratic President Barack Obama's two terms.

Republicans' Economic Outlook Improves Substantially

After Trump won last week's election, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U.S. economy's outlook than they did before the election. Just 16% of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81% said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49% say it is getting better and 44% worse.

Conversely, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents' confidence in the economy plummeted after the election. Before the election, 61% of Democrats said the economy was getting better and 35% worse. Now, Democrats are evenly divided, with 46% saying it is getting better and 47% saying it is getting worse.

Perceptions of Whether Economy Is Getting Better or Worse by Political Party, Before and After the 2016 Presidential Election Republicans, pre-election (Nov 1-7 ) Republicans, post-election (Nov 9-13 ) Democrats, pre-election (Nov 1-7 ) Democrats, post-election (Nov 9-13 ) % Getting better 16 49 61 46 % Getting worse 81 44 35 47 Index (% better minus % worse) -65 +5 +26 -1 Party groups include independents who lean to the party Gallup Daily tracking

Republicans Less Negative About Current Economic Conditions

In addition to being more optimistic about the economy's future than they were before the election, Republicans are also slightly less negative about where economic conditions currently stand -- likely because they will have a Republican president in the near future. However, they remain negative overall about the current state of the economy under the incumbent Democratic president. It is likely that their view of current economic conditions will further improve, possibly into positive territory, when Trump takes office in January.

Republicans' current conditions component score has increased to -5, up significantly from -21 before the election. The latest score is the result of 21% of Republicans saying the economy is ""excellent"" or ""good,"" and 26% saying it is ""poor.""

Democrats, on the other hand, have become more negative in their views of the current state of the U.S. economy, but the change is smaller among this group. Democrats' component score fell to +17 after the election, compared with +26 beforehand.

Bottom Line

The election of Trump has transformed the way Republicans and Democrats view the economy, particularly in their assessments of whether it is getting better or worse. But given the political and economic tumult of the past week, measures of the index in the coming weeks may be more indicative of U.S. economic confidence in the year ahead. On the one hand, global markets trembled on election night as Trump's victory became clearer. On the other hand, U.S. markets rallied later in the week, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching a new high on Monday.

It's too early to say whether these are sustainable gains in confidence. But in the immediate future, Trump's victory has improved his party's confidence in the economy. Barring any major events, it is likely that Republicans will shift to a positive index score once the incoming president takes office, while Democrats' confidence will take a hit.

These data are available in Gallup Analytics.

It whittled their paychecks. It devalued the type of work they did best. It shuttered factories and mines and shops in their communities. New industries sprouted in cities where they didn't live, powered by workers with college degrees they didn't hold.

They were not the only ones who felt abandoned by a rapidly globalizing economy, but they developed a distinctly strong pessimism in its face.

On Tuesday, their frustrations helped elect Donald Trump, the first major-party nominee of the modern era to speak directly and relentlessly to their economic and cultural fears. It was a “Brexit” moment in America, a revolt of working-class whites who felt stung by globalization and uneasy in a diversifying country where their political power had seemed to be diminishing.

Early on the morning of Nov. 9, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York. Here are key moments from that speech. (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

It was a rejection of the business-friendly policies favored at various points by elites in both parties, which deepened trade relationships with foreign countries and favored allowing more immigrants in. And it was a raw outburst at the trends of rising inequality and economic dislocation that defined America's economy thus far this century.

Whites without a college degree — men and women — made up a third of the 2016 electorate. Trump won them by 39 percentage points, according to exit polls, far surpassing 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney's 25 percent margin. They were the foundation of his victories across the Rust Belt, including a blowout win in Ohio and stunning upsets in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In polling, these voters have expressed deep racial and cultural anxieties. In exit polls they were more likely than the country as a whole to say that illegal immigrants should be deported. But those polls also suggested economic concerns and hostility toward leaders in Washington were much more important factors driving them to Trump.

Half of these voters said the economy was the most important issue in their vote, compared to 14 percent for immigration. A majority said international trade takes away American jobs. Three-quarters said the economy is “not good” or “poor” and nearly 8 in 10 said their personal financial situation was the same or worse than it was four years ago. Two-thirds said they preferred Trump to handle the economy instead of Democrat Hillary Clinton, compared with less than half of the electorate overall.

These frustrations were not new. They had mounted for decades, boiling over in the slow recovery from the Great Recession. That was particularly true among men. From 1975 to 2014, according to census data analyzed by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, white male workers without a college degree saw their median incomes fall by more than 20 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Their incomes fell 14 percent between 2007 and 2014.

Last year, amid a much improved U.S. economy and a tightening labor market, their incomes had jumped by 6 percent, according to the Center's analysis. But that increase was nowhere close to enough to make up the ground lost in the recession — let alone since the 1970s.

“It’s completely understandable how these workers feel left behind,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the center who is a former aide to Vice President Biden.

At the same time, these working class whites have seen the fruits of American prosperity increasingly go to the very rich. “Superstar” cities, like San Francisco, Boston and yes, Washington, gained even more wealth, and they have been responsible for an increasingly large share of the country's job growth.

Meanwhile, non-college whites saw jobs go away and businesses fold in the rural communities and smaller cities where they are more likely to live, particularly in the Rust Belt.

“Their access to economic opportunity in large measure comes down to the luck of geography,” said John Lettieri, co-founder of the Economic Innovation Group, an advocacy group whose research also showed that this group of voters is underrepresented in America's most prosperous regions.

Many of the downtrodden areas have lost factory jobs over the last several decades, as expanding trade and advancing technology pushed the economy away from production work and into services. Some areas suffered as coal mines closed. Others experienced rapid growth in high-paying energy extraction and support jobs several years ago as hydraulic fracturing boomed, only to watch many of those jobs evaporate when oil prices fell.

The workers increasingly came to see trade deals as the culprit — namely the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada in the 1990s and the effort to open up trade up trade with China in 2000, a decision that economic research suggested has cost America at least 2 million jobs on net.

Trump courted working class whites by promising a restoration of the old industrial economy — through renegotiated trade deals and tariffs on imports; by pledging to deport immigrants, which he said would reduce competition for native-born workers; and by promising rapid economic growth from tax cuts, deregulation and more drilling.

Many economists, including several conservative ones, warn Trump's plans will not deliver the relief those workers are seeking. Some say tariffs won't bring back jobs and could actually lead to recession. Others say Trump's plans ignore more critical issues for the working class, such as the need for improved worker training or measures to encourage workers to migrate to higher-opportunity regions.

“That’s the most disappointing part of the 2016 election,” said Abby McCloskey, an economist who focuses on the middle class and who advised some of Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination. Like Clinton, she said, Trump had “resorted to partisan talking points that the system is rigged against these workers.”

Trump's message did not resonate with black or Latino workers, who earn less at every education level than whites do. Those workers lean Democratic by various degrees but appeared especially repelled by Trump's attacks on immigrants and his stoking of racial resentments.

Critically, his huge margins among blue-collar whites would not have sufficed to deliver him the presidency, if he had not also maintained a slim advantage among whites with college degrees as well. As a group, those workers have been the winners of the new economy, blessed with cheaper imported consumer goods and a persistent wage advantage over their non-college counterparts.

Trump's challenge was inspiring the blue-collar whites without alienating the college-educated ones. He succeeded, and it won him the White House."

Trump gets set to enter the White House. For anyone in Britain, there is a sharp tang of déjà vu in the air: this feels like the morning after the Brexit vote all over again. Eric Kaufmann explains that, as with Brexit, there’s little evidence that the vote had much to do with personal economic circumstances.



For months, commentators have flocked to diagnose the ills that have supposedly propelled Trump’s support, from the Republican primaries until now. As in Britain, many have settled on a ‘left behind’ narrative – that it is the poor white working-class losers from globalization that have put Trump over the top. Only a few clairvoyants – Michael Lind, Jonathan Haidt – have seen through the stereotypes.

But, as in Britain, there’s precious little evidence this vote had much to do with personal economic circumstances. Let’s look at Trump voting among white Americans from a Birkbeck College/Policy Exchange/YouGov survey I commissioned in late August. Look at the horizontal axis running along the bottom of figure 1. In the graph I have controlled for age, education and gender, with errors clustered on states. The average white American support for Trump on a 0-10 scale in the survey is 4.29.

You can see the two Trump support lines are higher among those at the highest end of the income scale (4) than the lowest (1). This is not, however, statistically significant. What is significant is the gap between the red and blue lines. A full two points in Trump support around a mean of 4.29. This huge spread reflects the difference between two groups of people giving different answers to a highly innocuous question: ‘Is it more important for a child to be considerate or well-mannered?’ The answers sound almost identical, but social psychologists know that ‘considerate’ taps other-directed emotions while ‘well-mannered’ is about respect for authority.

People’s answer to this question matters for Trump support because it taps into a cultural worldview sometimes known as Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA). Rather than RWA, which is a loaded term, I would prefer to characterise this as the difference between those who prefer order and those who seek novelty. Social psychologist Karen Stenner presciently wrote that diversity and difference tends to alarm right-wing authoritarians, who seek order and stability. This, and not class, is what cuts the electoral pie in many western countries these days. Income and material circumstances, as a recent review of research on immigration attitudes suggests, is not especially important for understanding right-wing populism.

Figure 1.

Now look at the same graph in figure 2 with exactly the same questions and controls, fielded on the same day, in Britain. The only difference is that we are substituting people’s reported Brexit vote for Trump support. This time the income slope runs the other way, with poorer White British respondents more likely to be Brexiteers than the wealthy. But income is, once again, not statistically significant. What counts is the same chasm between people who answered that it was important for children to be well-mannered or considerate. In the case of Brexit vote among White Britons, this represents a 25-point difference around a mean of 45.8 per cent (the survey undersamples Brexiteers but this does not affect this kind of analysis). When it comes to Brexit or Trump, think successful plumber, not starving artist or temporary lecturer.

Figure 2.

Some might say that even though these populist voters aren’t poor, they really, actually, surely, naturally, are concerned about their economic welfare. Well, let’s take a look at the top concerns of Trump voters in figure 3. I’ve plotted the issues where there are the biggest differences between Trump supporters and detractors on the left-hand side. We can start with inequality. Is this REALLY the driving force behind the Trump vote – all that talk about unemployment, opioid addiction and suicide? Hardly. Nearly 40 per cent of those who gave Trump 0 out of 10 (blue bar) said inequality was the #1 issue facing America. Among folks rating the Donald 10 out of 10, only 4 per cent agreed. That’s a tenfold difference. Now look at immigration: top issue for 25 per cent of white Trump backers but hardly even registering among Trump detractors. Compared to immigration, even the gap between those concerned about terrorism, around 2:1, is not very striking.

Figure 3.

For Brexit vote, shown in figure 4, the story is much the same, with a few wrinkles. The gap on immigration and inequality is enormous. The one difference is on ‘the economy in general,’ which Trump supporters worry about more than Brexiteers. This could be because in the graph above I am comparing extreme Trump backers with extreme detractors whereas the Brexit-Bremain numbers include all voters. Still, what jumps out is how much more important immigration is for populist voters than inequality.

Figure 4.

Why is Trump, Brexit, Höfer, Le Pen and Wilders happening now? Immigration and ethnic change. This is unsettling that portion of the white electorate that prefers cultural order over change.

The US was about 90 percent white in 1960, is 63 percent white today and over half of American babies are now from ethnic minorities. Most white Americans already think they are in the minority, and many are beginning to vote in a more ethnopolitical way. The last time the share of foreign born in America reached current levels, immigration restrictionist sentiment was off the charts and the Ku Klux Klan had 6 million members – mainly in northern states concerned about Catholic immigration.

Ethnic change can happen nationally or locally, and it matters in both Britain and America. Figure 5, which includes a series of demographic and area controls, looks at the rate of Latino increase in a white American survey respondent’s ZIP code (average population around 30,000 in this data). The share of white Americans rating Trump 10 out of 10 rises from just over 25 percent in locales with no ethnic change to almost 70 percent in places with a 30-point increase in Latino population.

The town of Arcadia in Wisconsin – fittingly a state that has flipped to Trump – profiled in a recent Wall Street Journal article, shows what can happen. Thomas Vicino has chronicled the phenomenon in other towns, such as Farmer’s Branch, Texas or Carpentersville, Illinois. There are very few ZIP codes that have seen change on this scale, hence the small sample and wide error bars toward the right. Still, this confirms what virtually all the academic research shows: rapid ethnic change leads to an increase in anti-immigration sentiment and populism, even if this subsequently fades. The news also spreads and can shape the wider climate of public opinion, even in places untouched by immigration.

Figure 5.

Now let’s look in figure 6 at Brexit, and how White British voters in wards with fast East European growth in the 2000s voted. With similar controls, it’s the same story: when we control for the level of minorities in a ward, local ethnic change is linked with a much higher rate of Brexit voting. From under 40 percent in places with no ethnic change to over 60 percent voting Brexit in the fastest changing areas. Think Boston in Lincolnshire, which had the strongest Brexit vote in the country and where the share of East Europeans jumped from essentially zero in 2001 to the highest in the country by 2011.

Figure 6.

The Trump and Brexit votes are the opening shots which define a new political era in which the values divide between voters – especially among whites – is the main axis of politics. In a period of rapid ethnic change, this cleavage separates those who prefer cultural continuity and order from novelty-seekers open to diversity. Policymakers and pundits should face this instead of imagining that old remedies – schools, hospitals, jobs – will put the populist genie back in the bottle.

“My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden and will tap into the incredible, unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams,” Trump said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York.

The Republican nominee said his plans would raise the nation’s economic growth rate to at least 3.5 percent, well above its current rate of about 2 percent, and create 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years.

For Trump’s plans to succeed, they would have to overcome forces in the economy, such as rising automation, an aging population and low-wage competition overseas, that have led even conservative economists to say a 3.5 percent growth rate is an improbable goal.

The U.S. economy is already creating 2.5 million jobs a year, the same pace promised by Trump over the next decade.

The heart of Trump’s plan is a revised tax code, which includes a pledge that no business should pay more than 15 percent of its income in taxes, down from the current 35 percent corporate tax rate. Few businesses now pay the full 35 percent rate, taking advantage instead of many deductions in the existing tax code.

He also proposed simplifying the U.S. tax code for individuals, reducing the current seven tax brackets to three: 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent of income after deductions.

Trump called for the elimination of what’s known as the carried interest loophole, which is used by hedge funds and other investment funds to reduce their tax burden.

As president, Trump said he would cut the number of regulations imposed by the federal government, including some that are designed to combat climate change and protect the food Americans eat. The celebrity businessman said that “excessive regulation” costs Americans nearly $2 trillion a year.

Among those he plans to target: Environmental Protection Agency regulations for coal-fired power plants and standards for ground level ozone. His campaign also said he would target the Food and Drug Administration’s “food police,” and rules that govern “food production hygiene, food packaging, food temperatures.”

Trump said he will lift restrictions on energy production, including offshore drilling, scrap trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and implement a child care plan, including six weeks of paid maternity leave, he outlined earlier this week.

While Trump said the economic growth and some limited spending cuts would fully pay for the cost of his tax cuts, and may even allow for a reduction in the nation’s federal budget deficit, critics have said his economic proposals would add as much as $10 trillion to the nation’s debt over the course of a decade.

The campaign disputes those estimates. To help offset the cost of the tax cuts, he said Thursday his administration would reduce non-defense, non-safety net spending by one percent of each previous year’s total. Trump said that would reduce spending by $1 trillion over a decade.

He vowed to not cut defense spending and to exempt Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid from any reductions. Yet if benefits to veterans are included as part of defense spending, the programs Trump places off limits for cuts make up nearly 70 percent of the federal budget, and it wasn’t immediately clear how he would reach his spending cut goal with such programs off the table.

Such an approach also would conflict with House Speaker Paul Ryan plans for the federal budget, widely embraced by Republicans, that call for reining in the costs of programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

While looking at number of influences on the presidential vote outcome, we found that in a year of massive divides, one particular economic split stands out.

Our observation: The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America’s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015. By contrast, the more-than-2,600 counties that Donald Trump won generated just 36 percent of the country’s output—just a little more than one-third of the nation’s economic activity.

Candidates’ counties won and share of GDP in 2000 and 2016

Year Candidates # of Counties won Aggregate share of GDP 2000 Al Gore 659 54% George W. Bush 2397 46% 2016 Hillary Clinton 472 64% Donald Trump 2584 36%

Source: Brookings analysis of Moody’s Analytics estimate

To see how this could be, take a look at this quick visualization, which suggests what’s going on:

Here you can see very clearly that with the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas and a big chunk of Long Island Clinton won every large-sized county economy in the country. Her base of 493 counties was heavily metropolitan. By contrast, Trumpland consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny low-output locations that comprise the non-metropolitan hinterland of America, along with some suburban and exurban metro counties, as Indeed Chief Economist Jed Kolko pointed out in a tweet.

Moreover, while this divide is striking by any standard, it appears to be “unprecedented in the era of modern economic statistics,” as Tankersley noted in his story, for a losing presidential candidate to have represented so large a share of nation’s economic base. By comparison, Democratic Presidential candidate Al Gore in 2000 won counties that generated only about 54 percent of the country’s gross domestic product en route to winning the popular vote, while losing the election in the Electoral College. Gore, won more than 100 more counties in 2000 than Clinton did in 2016, meaning that his appeal, while less monolithic across high-output counties, extended into more lower-output areas.

The upshot: No election in decades has revealed as sharp a political divide between the densest economic centers and the rest of the country — between what Tankersley labeled in a tweet “high-output” and “low-output” America.

All of which suggests multiple problems. Most broadly, the stark political divide underscores the likelihood of the two parties talking entirely past each other on the most important issues of economic policy. Given the election map we revealed, the Trump administration will likely feel pressure to respond most to the desires and frustrations of the nation’s struggling hinterland, and discount the priorities and needs of the nation’s high-output economic base."

John Taylor: Economic growth and job growth will increase if there is tax reform, regulatory reform and monetary reform. There is a great deal of agreement by President-Elect Trump and by Congress about these issues, so there is an opportunity to increase economic growth. For example, the Trump tax reform proposal and the Ways and Means tax reform proposal are very close in reducing rates and expanding the base. Similarities also exist in the areas of regulation and monetary reforms.

John Cochrane: This depends on what Trump and congressional Republicans do with their golden opportunity. I hope they stick to the script: Pass the Paul Ryan “better way” regulatory reform plan, pass straightforward fixes to the tax code, entitlements, the Affordable Care Act, financial regulation and so forth. Bipartisan reform plans are on the shelf for all of these. Immigration reform and trade are a stretch, given campaign rhetoric, but given widespread consensus, there is hope here, too. There is a need to rein in the out-of-control and politicized regulatory agencies. If they just did this simple mind-the-store sort of thing, restoring some rule of law and certainty to the lives of businesses and reducing the flow of favors out of Washington, D.C., the economy ought to take off.

What do you expect to change?

Taylor: This depends on policy. My research [for example, in First Principles] and that of others shows that the slow growth of the economy during the past dozen years is mainly due to economic policy deviating from the principles that have worked in the 1980s and 1990s. A change in policy will improve the current trajectory of the economy.

Cochrane: If the president and Congress stick to the simple script of commonsense reform, economic growth should take off. If they start fighting among themselves, waste effort on social issues, immigration and trade barriers and start misusing regulatory and legal power for their own political purposes, then stagnation will continue until the next crisis or recession.

What are the factors that could affect the economy in the future regardless of which president is leading the country?

Taylor: The growth of the global economy is important. Here the United States needs to show leadership in making sure that the openness of the U.S. economy is matched by similar openness in the rest of the world. This could be a principle of our international agreements in the trade and monetary areas.

John Cochrane (Image credit: Courtesy John Cochrane)

Cochrane: We pay far too much attention to presidents and their agendas. This isn’t an elected dictatorship. People should pay attention to Congress, where much policy leadership resides now, and the courts. Wickard v. Filburn should be the litmus test now – economic freedom – not Roe v. Wade. People should pay attention to state and local affairs. The federal government doesn’t run the Palo Alto zoning board.

The big picture is enormously hopeful: self-driving everything, the gene and microbiome revolutionize medicine. We see this here in Silicon Valley. But those great ideas need to be embodied into new disruptive companies, which makes existing companies very unhappy and sends them to Washington for protection. On the other hand, there are earthquake faults with a lot of built-up stress, lots of debts that people can’t pay and promises that can’t be kept. If not managed adroitly, the next crisis will be upon us sooner than we think.

What are some positive aspects about the state of the economy that this country could hope to preserve?

Taylor: The most positive aspects are the U.S tradition of the rule of law, the reliance on markets and a cost-benefit approach to government at the federal, state and local level. U.S. colleges and university are at the top, but not K-12 education. The U.S. needs to build on the success at the college level and improve the K-12 levels.

Cochrane: The United States is still the most innovative country in the world. Our legal and regulatory system, with all its warts, has a lot more checks and balances than other countries.

What are some of the potential challenges that could surface under Trump?

Taylor: The country is now quite divided about what to do, but everyone wants a stronger economy and improved security. The challenge is to bring greater unity on policy so we get the needed economic reforms.

Cochrane: Trump will face internal political challenges. He has to unite the Republicans and peel off the centrist Democrats. The split in the Democratic party and Trump’s relative lack of ideology can be strong assets to forge a free market, socially liberal consensus. He will face international challenges – Russian and Chinese adventurism, chaos in the Middle East – all tempting quick and thoughtless reactions. He needs, first of all, to go quietly reassure our friends and allies that we stand with them – no spin, no big public statements, we have your back. We will speak softly, carry a big stick and mean what we say.

We've broken down the two candidates' policy proposals for the economy on everything from Wall Street regulation to fiscal policy. Using the campaigns' official positions as well as statements from the candidates themselves, we look closely at the details, and what economists have said about their potential impact.

Skye Gould/Business Insider

Taxes

Trump's plan would move all Americans into three tax brackets, down from the current seven. The top bracket for married joint filers making more than $225,000 a year would pay 33%; the $75,000-to-$225,000 bracket would pay 25%; and the under-$75,000 bracket would pay 12%. Right now, people who make under $75,00o pay a 15% rate, while the top bracket — made up of those making $466,950 — pays 39.6%.

Trump would cut the corporate tax rate to 15%. It now sits at 39%, but many companies pay much less in their effective tax rate. The average effective tax rate for S&P 500 companies is 29%, according to research by Goldman Sachs.

According to the Tax Policy Center, Trump's plan would incentivize investment by businesses and individuals, but the benefits would be offset unless there was a significant decrease in federal spending. Currently, Trump's plan indicates that he would increase spending.

The total impact of Trump's tax proposal would decrease GDP growth by 4% over the next 20 years from the baseline scenario of the current tax policies according to the Tax Policy Center report.

Clinton's plan calls for increasing taxes for people who make over $5 million a year by 4%, in what her campaign calls the ""Fair Share Surcharge."" Additionally, Clinton would make it so that people making more than $1 million a year do not pay an effective tax rate (after deductions) under 30%.

For corporations, Clinton plans to prevent ""inversions,"" in which companies move their headquarters overseas in order to pay a lower rate, and charge an ""exit fee"" on companies moving their businesses outside the country.

According to the Tax Policy Center, Clinton's plan would decrease investment from the top earners but would also significantly reduce the federal deficit.

""And the proposals would raise marginal tax rates on labor and capital, thus reducing incentives to work, save, and invest among high-income households,"" said the report. ""The proposals would increase federal revenues by $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years and would therefore reduce future deficits and slow, somewhat, the accumulation of public debt.""

Job growth

Clinton has introduced a number of measures to try to produce job growth. In addition to investing in infrastructure and manufacturing, Clinton has emphasized ending ""quarterly capitalism,"" which focuses on returns to shareholders. Clinton aims to get businesses to focus on labor and capital investment by modifying capital-gains taxes, giving tax credits for long-term investments and new hires, and ""shedding a light"" on excessive stock buybacks.

""And here’s something that you don’t always hear enough of from Democrats: a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay,"" Clinton said in a speech on August 11. ""And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our private investments.""

Trump does not have a specific plan on creating job growth, but his policy positions are designed to increase jobs in the US. For instance, Trump wants to decrease regulation on energy production to create mining and energy-related jobs, which have been decreasing in recent years.

""We are also going to fully capture America’s tremendous energy capacity,"" said Trump in a speech on June 28. ""This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines.""

Also, Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare, which he said would save 2 million jobs over the next 10 years. Trump has also stated that his trade polices will lead to more manufacturing and goods-based jobs in America.

Clinton has said that she would strengthen regulation on financial institutions and also crack down on nonfinancial lending from the ""show banking"" sector. Additionally, Clinton's plan calls for reducing compensation to executives at financial institutions in the event of fines from regulators.

""While institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences — or none at all, even when they’ve already pocketed the gains,"" said Clinton in a speech on July 13. ""This is wrong, and on my watch, it will change.""

Trump, on the other hand, has called for a repeal of the Dodd-Frank regulation that grew out of the financial crisis, saying it has prevented banks from lending money to average Americans. Additionally, Trump has called for a ""pause in all new regulation"" and a review of existing regulation, which would appear to include regulation on Wall Street. Trump has been critical of hedge fund managers, saying they ""get away with murder."" But it is unclear what he would do to address the issue. In his economic vision on the campaign website, there is no mention of either Wall Street or Dodd-Frank.

""Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,"" said Trump told Reuters in May.""It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop.""

Trade

One of the largest differences between the candidates has been their ideas on global trade.

Trump has been mostly protectionist, saying that existing trade deals have taken manufacturing out of the country while railing against free-trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). At one point in the campaign, Trump suggested a 45% tariff on all Chinese imports. While he later went back on the idea, Trump has been adamant in his assertion that China is ""sucking us dry.""

""When Donald J. Trump is president, China will be on notice that America is back in the global leadership business and that their days of currency manipulation and cheating are over,"" reads the Trump campaign's website. ""We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.""

Trump believes that negotiating new deals could be beneficial, and the US could ""win"" at trade under his presidency.

Meanwhile, Clinton does not have a specific trade plan but has pledged to fight the TPP, a deal she once helped to create. In general, Clinton has shifted from pro free trade to something of a trade skeptic.

""My message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" said Clinton during a speech in Michigan in August. ""I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president. As a senator, I fought to defend New York's manufacturers and steel makers from unfair Chinese trading practices.""

Fiscal policy

Both candidates have emphasized the importance of investing in American infrastructure and spending federal money on projects. Trump has said that the country needs to rebuild ""crumbling"" roads and bridges, while Clinton has similarly said that rebuilding infrastructure is key to America's future.

Clinton's plan calls for a five-year, $275 billion investment into a variety of projects, including airport modernization and Wi-Fi accessibility in rural areas.

""So we have to rebuild the infrastructure we have, and we have to build a stronger future together because every community in our country, every single one of them, deserves clean water, clean air, clean energy, and think of the millions of people we can put to work, including some of those laborers right down there in the front,"" said Clinton during a speech in California in July.

Trump's campaign said that he will lead a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure by using tax incentives to spur private investment.

The plan would give private firms an 82% tax break after asking for an initial investment to build revenue-generating infrastructure projects such as toll roads and airports. The Trump campaign said this would require no corresponding tax increases.

What economists say

A number of Wall Street researchers have weighed in on the economic plans of Clinton and Trump. The consensus is that Clinton's plan would roughly maintain the status quo from President Obama's tenure.

""Our expectations for a Clinton presidency do not require changing our outlook for growth, policy, earnings, and inflation,"" said James Sweeney, chief fixed-income economist at Credit Suisse.

If Clinton is able to follow through on all her stated goals, however, it could put pressure on business investment and keep economic uncertainty high enough to curb some growth.

""How left of center Clinton is once in office will determine the degree to which uncertainty drag diminishes post-election,"" wrote Dana Peterson, a North American economist at Citi in a note to clients in August. ""Uncertainty could remain elevated or even increase if Clinton pursues the more populist aspects of her campaign platform (e.g. 'America First' attitude towards trade, aggressively higher taxes, more intense regulation of the financial sector, leaning too hard on China)."""

Trump has the good fortune of taking office as the economy is finally recovering from the 2008 crisis. For Democrats, the bad news is that just as Barack Obama got tarred by the struggling economy that he inherited from George W. Bush, Trump will get credit for the good economy that he inherits from Obama—growth in the last quarter of 3.5 percent, unemployment of 4.6 percent (a level not seen for nine years), and 16 million jobs added since the recovery began.

All this will be good for Trump, if he doesn’t mess it up. And that’s the rub: there is a good chance he will. His policies make it almost inevitable. The president-elect seems to believe that he can make the economy grow at 4 percent annually, as promised, while at the same time massively bringing down the trade and fiscal deficits, if not turning them into surpluses. But the laws of economics don’t bend to political rhetoric, and there are some surprises in store for the new president.

First, let’s take a look at what seems to be Trump’s core economic strategy. To the extent that a strategy can be discerned, it involves a big tax cut for the rich, an infrastructure program driven by tax credits, increased military spending, browbeating firms not to move jobs abroad, a 45 percent tariff on goods from China, and the repeal of the Dodd-Frank legislation and other financial and environmental regulations. For those of us old enough to remember Ronald Reagan, it’s largely another dose of Reaganomics: the notion of incentivizing the economy through lower taxes while simultaneously liberalizing the economy so that entrepreneurs can get down to the task of making it strong. Indeed, the growth should be so strong that, in theory, tax revenues would increase and even those at the bottom, who got little direct benefit from tax cuts, would be much better off than they otherwise would have been.

Well, for Reagan, things didn’t quite go as planned. The deficit soared, growth slowed, inequality grew, those in the middle saw their incomes stagnate, and those at the bottom saw their incomes fall. The economy began its rapid deindustrialization, but nothing was done to help those whose jobs were destroyed. Thus was born the “displaced middle”—the group of angry middle-aged white men who seem to have been central to Trump’s campaign.

As the liberalization agenda continued after Reagan, the economy became exposed to increasing risks, facing its first financial crisis in more than a half century, in 1989, and the worst crisis in three quarters of a century, in 2008. Remarkably, after having suffered so much from this agenda—and with those in the middle having built up understandable anger—the country decided in 2016 to double down on a failed strategy.

Trump has been criticized by mainstream Republicans for not really being one of them. But he is definitely one of them when it comes to the central palliative for any ill befalling the country: a tax cut for the rich. Indeed, his proposed cut goes further than the tax cuts that others have proposed, with fully half the benefits flowing to the top 1 percent of Americans. Trump’s corporate tax reform has one thing to say for itself: it would end the perversion of the current system, which encourages multi-nationals to park their money abroad. But it does this at an enormous price: lowering the tax on the repatriated funds to some 10 percent, perhaps less—a tax giveaway of at least half a trillion dollars. And one thing we can be sure of: reducing taxes on past investments provides no beneficial future incentive.

The laws of normal economics dictate that lower taxes combined with increased spending will lead to bigger deficits. Trump criticized Obama’s deficits. How does one square the circle? Trump has some spending cuts in mind, but there will be significant spending increases, too—for instance, on the military. Privatization of Medicare will also be expensive, so spending there will increase as well, even if benefits received by the elderly decrease. And because federal-government employment has been repeatedly trimmed—as a percentage of the population, it’s the lowest it has been in at least 100 years—there’s not much fat left to cut. Someone has to administer well-loved programs, like Social Security, and someone is going to have to round up all those 11 million immigrants in order to deport them.

George H.W. Bush famously criticized Reagan for his “voodoo economics.” And he was right. But Trump is taking a page out of the same book. Somehow, this time, tax cuts and spending increases will so stimulate the economy that tax revenues will grow. In fact, Trump is as likely to be disappointed as Reagan was. People forget, but Reagan was forced to reverse and revise his 1981 tax cuts twice—in 1982 and 1986.

America has a major infrastructure deficit. Both Hillary Clinton and Trump recognized this. Trump’s plans for $1 trillion in infrastructure investment seem grandiose, but as with so much of Trump’s program, there is less here than meets the eye. His infrastructure program is supposed to be financed out of an 82 percent tax credit to hedge funds and others who undertake this investment. But unless one is willing to be patient—to wait three to six years—one has to rely on the long discredited “shovel ready” projects, which may create jobs willy-nilly, but won’t constitute the strategic infrastructure revolution the country needs.

Hedge funds are not noted for their long-term thinking—for them, a quarter is an eternity. Their goal will be to turn a quick buck on the government’s magnanimous offer before Washington wakes up. Here’s what they’ll likely do: they’ll try to privatize whatever public assets can be sold. Of course, from a societal point of view, this is not investment—it’s just changing ownership and control of assets. With the federal government paying 85 cents of every dollar spent in privatization, we can expect a gold rush. Ordinary citizens will pay twice for this gift to the hedge funds: first through the cost of the tax credits, and second through the tolls and fees that private owners will charge to recuperate their “investment.” This is a particularly foolish time to engage in such tax shenanigans, because government can borrow at close to zero interest rates. And it’s not as if the hedge funds have any experience in building and managing infrastructure. The history of such privatizations is disastrous: large numbers of them have failed within a few years, after the funds have taken out their money.

To see how the game is played, at our expense, let’s assume that a trillion dollars actually goes to new investment (an unlikely assumption). If the government itself had made the investment, the annual cost to the taxpayer would be $20 billion, assuming a 2 percent interest rate. Now assume that hedge funds borrow 80 percent, adding in $200 billion of their own money. But with the 82 percent tax credit, the Treasury is out $820 billion.

Note the Houdini arithmetic: the hedge funds only had to put up $200 billion, but they get a check from the Treasury for $820 billion. Trump doesn’t seem to understand that a tax credit is a form of government spending. That’s why we call such spending “tax expenditures.” His trillion dollars for “infrastructure spending” will not translate into a trillion dollars of new infrastructure. It will translate into a trillion dollars of additional deficit.

Trump has criticized the Federal Reserve for maintaining interest rates that are too low. Many members of the Fed have also been itching to raise interest rates. Some (joined by gold bugs and inflation hawks on Trump’s team) see inflation around the corner, given the buildup in the Fed’s balance sheet. Some worry about the distortion in financial markets, especially as irrational markets seem to price risk too low when interest rates get low. Some, worried that we have not had a recession for eight years (far longer than the typical period), want to “re-arm” the Fed so that it has some ammunition when the next one occurs. Trump has two appointments to make to the Fed, and if he chooses those inclined to his views, and replaces Janet Yellen when her term ends, in 2018, then interest-rate hikes and monetary tightening seem inevitable. But these actions will almost surely slow down the economy. There’s a good chance that monetary tightening will more than offset any stimulus that comes from tax cuts or new spending.

That’s because the fiscal stimulus is likely to be weak. As noted, much of the infrastructure spending won’t go to new infrastructure, but to privatization of existing infrastructure. Much of the money from that, as well as from the tax cuts, will go to the 1 percent, who spend a much smaller fraction of their income than those at the bottom.

There’s one more reason that the economy will be weak: contrary to what Trump wants or intends, the trade deficit will increase. Here’s a bit of economics that likely goes beyond Trump: whenever a country invests more than it saves, there must be an inflow of capital to finance the deficit; and that inflow of capital must be equal to the country’s trade deficit. Economists differ on lots of things, but not on what I’ve just written; these are truisms. So again, what matters is not political rhetoric, but a close examination of the underlying forces.

Trump claims that his program will stimulate national investment. As I’ve explained, I think he’s exaggerated the extent of new infrastructure. If history is a guide, little of the multi-national money coming back, under an amnesty, will wind up in investment, despite whatever promises are made. And higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy are likely to dampen investment, especially among small- and medium-size enterprises, the source of job creation in any economy.

But assume that Trump is partially correct: there will be an increase in national investment. At the same time, national savings are almost surely going down, as the deficit soars from the tax cuts. That means that the trade deficit will increase. And with the increase in imports exceeding exports, G.D.P. will be depressed. Worse still, the very group that Trump promised to help will be among the biggest losers, as America continues on its path of deindustrialization.

How, one might ask, is this possible, given Trump’s rhetoric, his determination to move against China with a 45 percent tariff? There’s a global macroeconomic variable that Trump left out of his calculus, and that’s America’s exchange rate—not just with China, but with the entire world. If America’s exchange rate increases, our exports become more expensive, and imports become cheaper—Italian designer clothing for the 1 percent and Indian and Bangladeshi clothing for the 99 percent.

Higher interest rates normally result in a higher exchange rate. But what happens if Trump does build his wall with Mexico, repeals NAFTA, imposes 45 percent tariffs against China, and labels China a foreign-exchange-rate manipulator? One of his advisers should have told him that China has been intervening in its exchange rate to prevent it from falling. If China stopped intervening, its exchange rate would fall—and our imports from China would increase. If it reduced restrictions on its citizens investing abroad, it would fall even more. If Trump imposes new tariffs on China, production of clothing and textiles won’t shift back to the U.S.; it will just move to elsewhere in the developing world. A few hi-tech companies might start producing goods in the U.S., but the sad news is that the jobs will be few and they will be hi-tech—not the jobs promised for the dislocated workers of the Rust Belt. And again, Trump will be foiled by the exchange rate: the higher tariff will result in a depreciation in China’s exchange rate, partially undoing any hoped-for benefits."

On the Republican side, supporters of Donald Trump stand out for their unfavorable views of free trade, negative assessments of national economic conditions and their own personal finances, and for being more likely than supporters of other GOP candidates to say the economic system in this country unfairly favors powerful interests. Despite these divisions, much also unites Republican registered voters who back different primary candidates. On policy, there is broad consensus that the government should not be responsible for ensuring that all Americans have health care coverage. And on broader values, large majorities of Republicans believe that hard work leads to success in this country and that government is doing too much better left to businesses and individuals.

There also are many points of general agreement among Democrats: That corporate profits are too high, that the government should ensure health care coverage for all Americans, and that the government should be doing more to solve problems. But differences also emerge among Democrats in their views of the country. Most Sanders supporters say that hard work is no guarantee of success in this country, while Clinton supporters take the view that people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard. In addition, most Clinton supporters say problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement; Sanders supporters aren’t so sure: About as many say U.S. efforts to solve problems around the world usually end up making things worse as say global problems would be even worse without U.S. efforts.

Views of national economic conditions

Most registered voters continue to see an uneven economic playing field in the U.S.: 68% say the economic system in the country unfairly favors powerful interests, while just 30% say the economic system is generally fair to most Americans.

Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters are slightly more likely to view the U.S. economic system as unfairly favoring powerful interests (54%) than being fair to most Americans (44%). This view is much more widespread among Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters. By a roughly four-to-one (80%-19%) margin, Democratic voters say the U.S. economic system unfairly favors powerful interests.

Among Republicans, a clear majority (61%) of Trump supporters say the economic system is tilted towards the powerful, compared with fewer (38%) who say it is generally fair. By contrast, about as many supporters of Cruz and Kasich say the U.S economic system is generally fair to most people as say it unfairly favors powerful interests.

An overwhelming 91% of Sanders supporters view the U.S. economic system as unfair, while just 9% say it is generally fair. Most Clinton supporters also hold this view, but by a somewhat less overwhelming margin (73%-25%).

Three-quarters of Democratic registered voters (75%) say that business corporations make too much profit, while just 22% say they make a fair and reasonable amount of profit. Among Republican registered voters a 58% majority believes that business corporations generally make a fair profit; 37% who say they make too much profit.

On balance, supporters of the three remaining Republican candidates see corporate profits as fair and reasonable rather than too high. However, the share of Trump supporters who say corporations make too much profit (43%) is somewhat higher than the share of Kasich (32%) or Cruz (31%) supporters who say this.

As with views of the fairness of the economic system, differences on the Democratic side are limited to the size of the majorities expressing a shared view. Fully 82% of Sanders supporters say business corporations make too much profit; a somewhat smaller majority (69%) of Clinton supporters also holds this view.

Heading into the election, views of current economic conditions in the U.S. today are mixed. A plurality of registered voters report that conditions are only fair (43%); smaller shares say that conditions are excellent or good (28%) or poor (29%). As has been the case throughout the Obama administration, Republican registered voters are more likely than Democratic registered voters to view economic conditions negatively.

Trump supporters have particularly negative perceptions of the state of the economy: Nearly half (48%) say conditions are poor and 39% say they are only fair; just 12% call them excellent or good. Supporters of Cruz and Kasich are less negative: Roughly three-in-ten Cruz (31%) and Kasich supporters (28%) say economic conditions are poor. Pluralities of Cruz and Kasich supporters (47% each) say that economic conditions in the country today are only fair.

Among Democratic voters, Clinton supporters have a brighter view of current economic conditions than Sanders supporters. Overall, 43% of Clinton supporters say that the economy is in excellent or good shape, while 41% say conditions are only fair and just 15% say the economy is in poor shape. Sanders supporters are more likely to describe conditions as only fair (46%) than as excellent or good (30%); 23% say conditions are poor.

Despite differing views on the state of the national economy, Republicans and Democrats have similar views about job availability in their local area. Roughly half of both Democratic and GOP registered voters say that jobs are difficult to find in their community (50% and 51%, respectively) while slightly smaller shares of both groups (43% of Democrats, 45% of Republicans) say there are plenty of jobs available.

A majority of Trump supporters (56%) say jobs are difficult to find in their community, while fewer (39%) say there are plenty of jobs available. Supporters of John Kasich offer more positive evaluations of their local job situation: 53% say there are plenty of jobs available in their community, while 42% say that jobs are difficult to find. Among Cruz supporters, 51% say jobs are difficult to find compared with 46% who say there are plenty of jobs available.

Among Democratic voters, Sanders supporters (55%) are more likely than supporters of Hillary Clinton (47%) to say jobs are difficult to find.

Trump supporters least satisfied about their personal finances

When it comes to assessments of personal finances, Donald Trump’s supporters are less satisfied with their own situation than backers of Ted Cruz or John Kasich. Half (50%) of Trump supporters say they are not very satisfied with their own financial situation, while 48% say they are generally satisfied with the way things are going for them financially. Among Kasich (73%-24%) and Cruz (61%-38%) supporters, far more say they are generally satisfied with their personal financial situation than not very satisfied.

Among Democratic voters, 65% of Hillary Clinton supporters and 57% of Bernie Sanders supporters say they are generally satisfied with their own personal financial situation.

Despite doubts about the fairness of the U.S. economic system, a majority of registered voters (61%) continue to say that most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard, while 37% say hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people.

Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are divided in their views on this question. Most Sanders supporters (57%) say that hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people, while 42% say that most people who want to get ahead can make it through hard work. Views among Clinton supporters are the reverse: By a 59%-39% margin, Clinton backers say that most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard.

There are no significant differences in views among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, with at least seven-in-ten of those who support Trump, Cruz or Kasich saying most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard.

Partisans remain deeply divided over federal role in health care

One of the widest partisan divides on issues is whether or not it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that all Americans have health care coverage. A broad 83%-majority of Republican registered voters say this is not the federal government’s responsibility; a similarly large 78%-majority of Democratic registered voters say this is the responsibility of the federal government.

Within the two parties there is little variation across supporters of each of the candidates. Broad majorities of Trump, Cruz and Kasich supporters say it is not the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, while large shares of Clinton and Sanders supporters say this is the responsibility of the federal government.

Little appetite for considering reductions in Social Security

When asked about the long-term future of Social Security, about seven-in-ten registered voters (71%) say that benefits should not be reduced in any way, while only about a quarter (26%) says some reductions in benefits for future retirees need to be considered.

While many questions regarding government benefits elicit opposing views among Republicans and Democrats, there is broad consensus on preserving Social Security benefits. Clear majorities of Republican and Democratic registered voters — and backers of all five presidential candidates — oppose reductions to the Social Security benefits of future retirees.

Free trade agreements viewed positively by Democratic voters

Registered voters are currently split in their overall view of how free trade agreements have impacted the U.S.: 47% say free trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries have been a good thing for the U.S., while about as many (43%) say they have been a bad thing. Opinions about free trade agreements among voters have turned more negative since May 2015, when more said they had been a good thing (53%) than a bad thing (37%) for the U.S. Current views are similar to those measured in March 2011 and April 2009.

Views of U.S. free trade agreements are more positive among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (56% good thing vs. 34% bad thing) than Republican and Republican-leaning voters (38% good thing vs. 53% bad thing). This marks a shift from May 2015, when both groups took a positive view of free trade, on balance.

Among Republican voters, Trump supporters stand out for their negative views of free trade: 67% of Trump supporters say free trade agreements have been a bad thing for the U.S., while just 27% say they have been a good thing. Republican supporters of Ted Cruz (48% good thing vs. 40% bad thing) and John Kasich (44% good thing vs. 46% bad thing) hold more mixed views.

By a 58% to 31% margin, more Clinton supporters say free trade agreements have been a good thing than a bad thing for the U.S. Views among supporters of Bernie Sanders are similar (55% good thing vs. 38% bad thing).

Registered voters’ perceptions of the personal impact of free trade agreements also are mixed: 42% say free trade agreements have definitely or probably helped the financial situation of their family; about as many (39%) say these agreements have definitely or probably hurt their family’s finances. Overall views on this question are little changed from May 2015, although attitudes have shifted within partisan groups since then.

In the current survey, more Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say free trade agreements have hurt their family’s finances (48%) than say they have helped (36%). In May 2015, about as many Republican voters said they had helped their family’s financial situation (38%) as hurt it (41%). By contrast, views among Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters in the current survey (48% helped vs. 32% hurt) are slightly more positive than they were in May 2015 (43% helped vs. 38% hurt).

As with views of the impact of free trade agreements on the country overall, Trump supporters are much more likely than Cruz or Kasich supporters to say free trade has hurt their own personal financial situation. By a 60% to 26% margin, more Republicans who support Trump for their party’s presidential nomination say free trade agreements have definitely or probably hurt their family’s finances than definitely or probably helped. Far fewer Kasich (42% helped vs. 42% hurt) or Cruz (45% helped vs. 36% hurt) supporters think free trade agreements have hurt the financial situation of their own family.

Among Democratic voters, supporters of Clinton take a slightly more positive view of free trade’s impact on their personal finances than supporters of Sanders. About half of Democratic voters who support Hillary Clinton (51%) say trade agreements have helped their finances, while fewer (29%) say they have hurt their finances. Among Sanders supporters, 36% say free trade agreements have hurt their family’s finances, compared with 46% who say they have helped.

Views of U.S. efforts to solve problems around the world

When it comes to U.S. engagement with global problems, a majority of registered voters see the U.S. as having a positive impact. Six-in-ten (60%) say problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement, while 34% say that U.S. efforts to solve problems around the world usually end up making things worse. Majorities of Republican (65%) and Democratic (58%) voters say U.S. global efforts usually do more good than harm.

Among Democrats, there is a divide in opinion about the impact of U.S. global involvement between Sanders and Clinton supporters. Two-thirds (66%) of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters who support Hillary Clinton say that problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement, compared with just 28% who say U.S. efforts usually make things worse. By contrast, about as many Sanders supporters say U.S. efforts to solve world problems usually end up making things worse (45%) as say problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement (49%).

Among Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters, 72% of Cruz supporters and 70% of Kasich supporters say that problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement; a narrower majority of Trump supporters (57%) also takes this view.

Republican and Democratic registered voters continue to express fundamentally different views on the role of government in this country.

About three-quarters of Republican voters (76%) say government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals, while just 22% say government should do more to solve problems. Democratic voters want a bigger role for government: 65% say it should do more to solve problems, compared with just 30% who say it is doing too much better left to business and individuals.

The preference for a government that does less is shared by large majorities of Republican supporters of Kasich (81%), Cruz (79%) and Trump (73%).

On the Democratic side, similar majorities of Sanders supporters (68%) and Clinton (66%) supporters say government should do more to solve problems."

Larry Beinhart is a novelist, best known for Wag the Dog.

The economy, and especially the anaemic recovery, has been a disappointment to all but the top 1 percent, and only the top 0.1 percent have really done well.

When Bill Clinton ran for president he had a note hanging from the wall beside his desk. It said, “It’s About the Economy, Stupid.”

So, too, is this election.

Sort of.

Bernie Sanders made it his issue. In America, “socialism” is a dirty word. The softcore version of the still dreaded “communism”. In spite of being a self-declared socialist, having the Democratic Party establishment lined up against him, and being the most ethical fundraiser in the history of American politics, Bernie seriously challenged Hillary Clinton.

Trump made it his issue. If he had been able to keep focus on it, it would be The Issue.

It remains an important part of his appeal. It is certainly the most valid, reality-based reason for his appeal.

Bad Trade Deals

According to Trump the reason that Americans are not doing well is the loss of manufacturing.

This is due to Bad Trade Deals. Especially NAFTA. And especially our Bad Deals with China, which, he says, is cheating.

It is also due to Illegal Immigrants. They take away jobs and lower the rates of pay for people who work.

OPINION: Trump for dummies

It is also because of the Washington Establishment. They have done nothing to help working people. They only help rich people, who have bought them. Trump knows, because he’s one of the rich guys who’s bought them.

Trump points out, as did Bernie Sanders, that Hillary Clinton is part of that Establishment.

Her husband, Bill Clinton, passed the worst trade deal of all, NAFTA, the free trade deal with Mexico and Canada. She was for the Trans-Pacific-Partnership, NAFTA with Asia, which would be even worse. She is against it now. Trump takes the credit for that.

Hillary doesn’t have real policies to fix the problems of the American economy.

What of this is true?

The illegal immigrant issue is flat-out false.

But it probably signals issues of relative deprivation.

Everyone has lost out in relation to the people in the cream on top.

White Men are not only doing less well, flat-out, they have also lost their economic and social superiority over the people who used to be reliably below them -ethnic and racial minorities and women. by

However, Women, Blacks, Latinos are doing better than they were 50 years ago. Much better.

Thus White Men are not only doing less well, flat-out, they have also lost their economic and social superiority over the people who used to be reliably below them – ethnic and racial minorities and women.

Manufacturing was where the well-paying jobs with good benefits were. Back in the Golden Age that Trump is referring to when he promises to “Make America Great Again”. Most people seem to agree that the loss of manufacturing jobs is the reason wages have gone down. Especially for men without college educations.

But now, entry-level car workers are now getting $14 an hour. As a point of reference, the movement to raise the minimum wage has been aiming at $15 an hour.

Therefore, there must be other factors that make for high and low pay than being in manufacturing. Even if Trump were to “bring jobs back from China, Mexico, Japan, Vietnam”, why would they pay more than the minimum wage? Which Trump thinks should not be raised.

It is also worth noting that every new car plant in America has, in fact, been bought with subsidies from the states and localities where they are located. So not only are the wages unimpressive, other people are being taxed to support them. Almost all large enterprises, including retailers such as Walmart, have learned to play this game.

OPINION: The garden of Americanly delights

Free trade, the ability to pit workers in different nations against each other, the ability to close a facility and move it to a develpoing country rather than pay decent wages and maintain decent health and safety standards, is one of the most powerful weapons that capital has in modern class warfare.

Class warfare

Is there class warfare in America? Take it from Warren Buffett, ranked in 2015 as the third wealthiest person in the world.

“There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”

Trump is right about the Establishment. There once was a part of the political establishment that was very concerned about the wellbeing of the middle class, the working class, and even the poor. That no longer seems to be the case.

The Clintons have been part of that change and they have benefited from it. Both politically and financially.

Under Roosevelt, the government had rescued America. It had rescued capitalism. Hell, it had rescued the world.

In 1980, along came Ronald Reagan, who said: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.'”

Ideologically, Reagan swept all before him. Government was bad. Taxes were bad. Regulations were bad. The response from the Left was feeble. The response from the Democratic Party was fear. The response from economists was to buy into it.

Bill Clinton ran for president in the wake of Reagan’s triumphs.

He adopted a tactic called “triangulation”. He kept some of his party’s ideals, but he also championed ideas that appealed to people on the Right. Most of all, he found ways to embrace Big Money, and for Big Money to embrace Democrats. The Republicans had older money. The Democrats had hipper, new money. But it was still a marriage based on the dowry.

There once was a part of the political establishment that was very concerned about the wellbeing of the middle class, the working class, and even the poor. That no longer seems to be the case. by

Clinton won two terms with triangulation.

There are now two parties in America, one that proudly represents the interests of money and one that sells out to money.

Hatred welcome

Long ago, Franklin Roosevelt said, “We know now that government by organised money is just as dangerous as government by organised mob … They are unanimous in their hate for me – and I welcome their hatred.”

Barack Obama had record contributions from Wall Street for his campaign. When he came into office, his financial advisers were part of the Wall Street, Federal Reserve, Clinton administration, and even Bush administration, revolving door. He told the bankers, in stern tones: “Only my administration stands between you and the pitchforks.”

The thing is, it did. No one was prosecuted. The Federal Reserve quietly – one might say secretly – gave the banks trillions of dollars. Most Democrats stood with him. The Republicans moved even further to the right.

Nobody screamed out against income inequality.

OPINION: An Introduction to Trumpology

Until Donald Trump. And Bernie Sanders.

The sad part is that Trump’s actual policy proposals will make things worse. He is taking the policies that created the problem and doubling them.

The good part is that Bernie Sanders – and Donald Trump – have pushed Hillary Clinton to actually look at the problem, to reconsider her married-to-the-money positions, and to come up with some solutions.

There are important ideological issues here. What makes a sound economy? Can we have the benefits of trade without the harm? What is the role of government? How does income inequality come to be? How dangerous is it? How can it be dealt with? In this new form of class warfare, is there anyone on our side?

Sadly, in this election, the answers are largely a con man’s come on and bombast on one side, and, except by accident, the establishment’s weary conventional wisdom on the other. They deserve deeper thought and greater insight. Not just in America. In different permutations and combinations these conflicts exist in every country. This is how the argument is playing out in the United States, but these are world issues.

Editor's note: This piece was originally posted on Real Clear Markets on December 13, 2016.

One month after the election, a huge market rally shows stock-market investors like the changes Donald Trump will bring to the business world. At the same time, great uncertainty remains about the new Administration’s policies toward the Middle East, Russia, trade relations, and other matters of state and defense. But on the core issues of macro policies for the U.S. economy, he will propose a large fiscal stimulus package and the Republican Congress will gladly go along. Details are still unknown, but they are likely to include lower tax rates on corporate profits and most personal income brackets, a massive public works initiative to modernize the nation’s infrastructure, and regulatory reforms that will favor profits in some sectors. Not only does the fiscal package promise to promote expansion, it comes at a time when the economy is doing pretty well even without it. Even before the election, the nation’s output was already growing quicker and the labor market was already getting tighter. In the third quarter, gross national output, an average of the income and product sides of the national accounts, rose at a 4.2 percent rate. And the unemployment rate declined to 4.6 percent in October, which was the average rate for 2006-2007 when the last expansion peaked. In this environment, some are alarmed that bond prices have tumbled since the election, seeing this as a signal of excessive deficits and rising inflation ahead.

So is adding fiscal stimulus in today’s environment too much of a good thing? Should Congress therefore balk at large tax or spending changes that add to deficits at this time? Many current economic models use an unemployment rate between 4 and 5 percent as full employment, taken as the rate that can be sustained without steadily accelerating inflation. The inference some will draw is that fiscal stimulus now risks overshooting into the inflationary zone with too low an unemployment rate. There are two issues here. One is how fast aggregate demand can grow without being constrained by the economy’s potential output level, which recent estimates show to be growing only slowly. The other is whether the Trump initiatives will have important supply-side effects that would make the economy’s potential output grow noticeably faster than these recent estimates, thus permitting a faster growth in aggregate demand and output. Sound infrastructure improvements will improve productivity in the long run, but their effects are spread over a distant future. And as for changes in income and profits taxes, estimates of supply-side effects range from modest to negligible among professional economists and from zero to important among politicians. Trump will sell his plans for taxes, spending, and regulation as measures that will grow productivity and raise the supply side potential of the economy. He is not reluctant to exaggerate. But even if, to be on the safe side, we assume supply side effects are negligible, it is being far too cautious to argue that we are too near full employment for a major fiscal stimulus now. Careful analysis shows that the labor market works most smoothly with a modest positive rate of price inflation. It also shows that there is no dangerous knife edge case with inflation hard to tame once it starts. The lowest annual unemployment rate since the late 1960s was 4.0 percent in 2000 and the core CPI inflation rate then was 2.6 percent. This was about the same rate that prevailed throughout the long expansion of the 1990s. So, although there will be lots of room to argue about aspects of Trumps’ program, an expansionary fiscal policy is the right macroeconomic policy today. And the sharp rise in government bond rates since the election should be seen as a return towards normalcy rather than as a signal of excessive deficits and inflation."

The story of the American economy in the past eight years is one of tension between an aggressive ""monetary"" policy and a nonexistent ""fiscal"" policy.

Monetary policy has come from the Fed lowering interest rates to nearly zero in an effort to pump up the economy. This policy has led to tepid growth, and essentially run its course. There is only so much the Fed can do.

Fiscal policy is a combination of reforming the corporate tax code and government spending on big projects that will pump money into the economy and create new jobs. With Republicans now in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, the years-long standoff may be broken.

President Barack Obama got a relatively wimpy stimulus package passed at the start of his term but hasn't been able to get anything going since then.



Left-wing economist Paul Krugman has been pounding the table for an increase in fiscal stimulus for years now, to no avail.

Trump could change all of this.

The first thing Trump mentioned in his victory speech was spending on infrastructure.

""We are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,"" he said. ""We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it."""

On Election Day, Donald Trump swept many traditionally Democratic Rust Belt states. One of those was Pennsylvania.

For the first time in more than two decades the Keystone State went red. The Democrats' upset in a once-reliable blue state was fueled by working-class voters who have seen their communities hit hard over the decades-long decline of coal, steel and manufacturing in their areas.

Rural Fayette County is an hour south of Pittsburgh and one of the poorest counties in the state. Though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans almost 3 to 1, unofficial county election results show Trump trounced Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by almost 30 points.

In Uniontown, the seat of Fayette County, Main Street is lined with decaying brick buildings. Several store fronts stand empty and many of the sidewalks are in need of repair. Area residents tell NPR that downtown used to be bustling and full of life, but the decline of ""king coal"" hit hard southwest Pennsylvania hard.

Watching his community decline is one reason lifetime Democrat and retired coal miner Walter Pleban voted for Donald Trump. Pleban hails from a long line of miners and even in retirement still supports the United Mine Workers of America.

""And what we'd like to see, they do something with the coal again because so many people in this area, in our area around here, worked in the mine,"" Pleban says. ""And now there's a lot of mines closed and there's a lot of fellows without jobs.""

Pleban hopes Trump will bring back jobs to Fayette County, though he wouldn't say how long he'd give the real estate mogul to make that happen.

""We'll see what happens,"" he says.

Tina Allen is also a lifelong Democrat who crossed the aisle to vote for Trump. Her husband is a coal miner.

""If he's unemployed, where is he going to go? He's almost 60 years old,"" Allen says.

Allen hopes with a President Donald Trump, her husband's mine will be able to stay open and maybe even hire more people. But her main concern is the Affordable Care Act and the high cost of health insurance. Allen says her daughter has high insurance premiums, though she's unsure if that insurance is through the ACA.

""Everyone I talked to that's on Obamacare, it has almost doubled,"" Allen says. ""So something needs done.""

Allen says she got in fights with her mother, a strict Democrat, over her choice to vote for Trump.

""We didn't speak for days. I was told if my grandfather was living, he would disown me,"" Allen says. ""I says, 'Mom, I've got to do what I have to do.'""

She and her mother have since made amends, Allen says – and right in time for the holidays.

Allen says Uniontown is also ready to put aside the politics and come together to celebrate the season. She's the lead organizer for the Uniontown's annual ""Home for the Holidays"" parade and light-up night. Allen helped transform downtown into small-town holiday fever on Thursday.

People lined the sidewalk of Main St. to see the parade, which included everything from the local high school marching band to dancers and costumed characters. The historic State Theatre was turned into a marketplace for homemade cookies sold for charity, and the mayor lit a Christmas tree in Storey Square to the sound of holiday music and the excited gasps of adults and giggles of children.

Community members of all political persuasions came out for the event including Fayette County Democratic Party Chairman Jim Davis.

In the spring, Davis was trying to raise alarm bells to his party. He told NPR that he was concerned about the large Republican turnout in the Pennsylvania primary and he that he was seeing Democrats in his country switch their party registration so they could vote for Trump in the general election.

The writing was on the wall.

""We didn't want to see it,"" Davis says. ""We didn't want to accept it but ... it was obvious.""

David doesn't square lay blame on Clinton. Instead, he says it was the system that allows people to think they have a right to run for a certain office is what failed the Democrats.

""You should earn it, and competition is better,"" Davis says.

""I think a lot of good candidates assumed she would be the candidate, she would be the next president and they stepped out,"" he says.

Davis believes the Democratic Party has to reinvent what they stand for in order to win back blue-collar voters and stop putting social issues at the forefront of the party. Democrats, he says, have to start talking about things like how to bring decent jobs into places like Fayette County.

""Not a job that pays $8 an hour with no benefits, but a job that can pay a reasonable wage with benefits that a man can raise his family, can hopefully buy a house and send his children off to college, maybe state school, but college,"" Davis says. ""That's the kind of thing we've got to start talking about."""

For the past five months, a Twitter bot created by the website Gawker had been sending him tweets with quotes from the Italian fascist Mussolini. Now, as one popped into Trump’s notifications – “It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep” – he pressed retweet, broadcasting the quote to more than 10 million followers.

Journalists spotted the tweet; later that day, Trump was asked about it on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But the billionaire was unrepentant. “It’s a very good quote,” he said. “I didn’t know who said it, but what difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else?”

Asked whether he wanted to be associated with Mussolini, Trump replied, “No, I want to be associated with interesting quotes.” And he added, “Hey, it got your attention, didn’t it?”

It seemed like a ridiculous statement. And, in conventional political terms, Trump was a ridiculous candidate. It wasn’t simply his outlandish and offensive comments, it was his threadbare campaign – because, in the early days especially, Trump ran his candidacy on the cheap. He skimped on staff and infrastructure. He refused to pay for expensive television ads. In the first two months of 2016, Trump spent less on TV advertising than any other major candidate.

But Trump didn’t need to pay for ads – because he had people’s attention. In the new economy, that is all that matters.

Attracting attention has been an industry – advertising – since the second half of the nineteenth century. But in the last 25 years, it has turned into the basis for the entire digital economy. The crucial change was the ability to produce and consume media at increasingly low marginal cost.

At first, people called this new era the “information age,” thinking that once knowledge could be produced cheaply, everyone would be given access to it. In fact, now that information could be manufactured for next to nothing, it became relatively unimportant. What mattered was the truly scarce resource: the attention to consume it.

Today, tech and media companies compete for attention, in the form of time spent on their apps and websites. The business model is simple: capture attention, then monetise it through advertising. Most people won’t click on the adverts, but enough will (or so we hope). In that sense, not much has changed since the first email spammers swamped Yahoo and Hotmail inboxes with ads for vitamins and penis-lengthening. The only difference: today the spam is called “content.”

Once, content meant meaningful material. Now, it means something akin to “stuff”. Instead of art, literature, film and journalism, we have “stuff”. The message – what, in some old fashioned sense, it actually “says” – is beside the point. All that matters is whether it grabs attention.

This dynamic is dictated by the big tech companies which effectively own the internet. Think of any app on your home screen: Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Gmail, Tinder. Every time they send you a notification it may purport to be for your own good, or at least your own convenience; in reality it is a call for attention. Once you arrive on the app, there are a host of tricks designed to keep you there, from Tinder’s swipe to Instagram’s infinite scroll."

She sat me down in a chair just beside her, and for more than an hour, explained why she detested Hillary Clinton and was ecstatic to vote for Trump this year.

Clinton, she told me, is an atheist who wears an earpiece during debates so billionaire George Soros can feed her talking points. The day Clinton collapsed into the back of her van when she was sick with pneumonia? According to Kessler, the Clintons hired a young actress to run up and give Clinton a hug for a staged photo after the collapse. Kessler also said she’d seen videos of Bill Clinton raping an underage girl but that the video had mysteriously disappeared. She wondered why no one was talking about Bill Clinton’s illegitimate, half-black son. And she said that whenever she talks negatively about Clinton online, “they”---presumably the technology overlords---shut her phone down.

At some point, I stopped Kessler to ask her where she’d gotten all these stories, stories I knew were false Clinton conspiracy theories. Her answer: “It was on my Facebook page.”

Kessler's stories were extreme, yes, but I should have known then that Trump enjoyed the support of enough people like Kessler, being fed an entirely different narrative about the two candidates, to help carry this election. But I missed it entirely. Because of her conviction that these stories were true, I considered Kessler part of a fringe that could not possibly gain the backing of enough voters to win. I missed this because, well, I was living in my own bubble, too.

I’ll stop here to say that, no, this isn’t another story about how Facebook gave us President-elect Trump. By now, there are plenty of solid stories like that, and they’re not wrong. To be sure, Facebook played an instrumental role in this election by allowing the kind of fake news stories Kessler described to me to proliferate and by giving all of us the option of only seeing the content we “like.” But it would be wrong to lay the election results entirely at Facebook’s feet. Trump won in large part because he mastered this particular moment in social media’s evolution in a way that no presidential candidate---not even Barack Obama, whose embrace of social media was historic in its own way---has ever done before.

We may not know exactly how rich our soon-to-be president actually is. But in an economy where clicks are currency, Trump is King Midas.

The Popularity Vote

Nicco Mele was as clueless as anyone that Trump was going to win the election. This is strange, since Mele actually predicted just that in his 2012 book, The End of Big. Mele describes how the internet enabled insurgent political candidates like Barack Obama in 2008 to succeed by corroding traditional top-down political power structures. That corrosion is in many ways a good thing, he wrote, because the political class is corrupt and divisive. “Yet in hastening the demise of parties and empowering upstarts, radical connectivity also paves the way for a dangerous populism to take hold of our political system,” he says. “We get exciting candidates like Barack Obama who can shake up the system, but also extremist or fringe candidates who if elected could bring the whole house down.”

Economics correspondent Paul Solman sat down with Columbia University’s Adam Tooze to discuss. An economic historian, Tooze gives much needed historical perspective to Trump’s economic plan as put forward by his economic adviser Peter Navarro on Real Clear Policy.

PAUL SOLMAN: You’ve read Donald Trump’s so-called Gettysburg address, his economic program. [In late October, Trump spoke to supporters in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where Lincoln gave his famous Gettysburg Address over 150 years ago.] Historically, what does it remind you of?

ADAM TOOZE: I think as a historian, what strikes one the most about this program is simply its nationalism. Thinking about the record of American economic programs, it strikes me as perhaps the most nationalist in tone and in spirit that we’ve seen in the U.S. since the so-called isolationism of the Republicans in the 1920s.

READ MORE: What is the Trump trade doctrine? His economic adviser explains

PAUL SOLMAN: The Roaring Twenties was a period of enormous economic growth in the United States.

ADAM TOOZE: Absolutely, it was also a period of a rebound from an enormous war, so the growth is not altogether surprising, but it was growth that was also unstable and that came crashing down in 1929 in the Great Depression. And it was a period in which America’s economic policy was, from the point of view of the wider world, unhelpful, some would even say irresponsible, in failing to figure out the implications of America’s policy on trade, its policy on migration and its policy on foreign investment as well as the implications of those policies for Europe and Asia in the 1920s. And so in that respect, too, one is worried, perhaps, about the historical parallels.

PAUL SOLMAN: And the historical parallels specifically with regards to, say, immigration and trade?

“What’s striking about the Trump program in its current form is that it’s unspecific about how it will be funded. It has about it the feel of financial engineering almost.”

ADAM TOOZE: Two of the key elements in the program that Trump outlined at Gettysburg are an aggressive assertion of American national interests with regards to trade policy. The renegotiation of NAFTA and the renegotiation of a recent deal with South Korea, for instance, are mentioned as hot button topics that the new administration will address. And the other nationalist plank of the program is obviously the policy toward immigration and the promise to dramatically change the regime of migration to the U.S.

PAUL SOLMAN: But the program also has a huge investment in infrastructure?

READ MORE: Column: How cities and states are leading the fight for more beneficial trade

ADAM TOOZE: So the investment program is there for infrastructure. Clearly, the United States economy is in desperate need of investment in its infrastructure to repair deterioration, to provide America with a 21st century backbone for economic growth. What’s striking about the Trump program in its current form is that it’s unspecific about how it will be funded. It has about it the feel of financial engineering almost. There’s an element of hand-waving about how government money will be multiplied by means of public-private partnership, which is a common feature in thinking about government spending in an age of high debt, when any incoming administration is looking to provide stimulus without ramping up enormous deficits and adding to America’s existing debt burden.

PAUL SOLMAN: But President-elect Trump seems to be committed to a major infrastructure program. If he doesn’t get the private investment, I would think, or at least people think, he will use government money to do it and provide the jobs and re-build America.

ADAM TOOZE: Yes, I mean the need for investment is evident, and it was also a major part of his stump speeches while he was touring America. It’s also part of the piece with his commitment to the redevelopment of American manufacturing and industrial jobs, providing jobs for the constituency which was so important in electing him last night.

“There’s no question at all that over the last 20 years blue-collar America, middle America, has been in the firing line of the pressures of globalization.”

There’s no question at all that over the last 20 years blue-collar America, middle America, has been in the firing line of the pressures of globalization, which is also being felt everywhere else in the world — in Europe, even in the rust-belt in China. In the 1980s and 1990s, major industrial concentrations that were built up in the heyday of heavy industry in the middle of the 20th century — 1930s, 1940s, 1950s — came under massive competitive pressure from new suppliers in the Asian tigers, in Japan and South Korea, and all of them saw huge job losses. And these have continued if one thinks, for instance, of the troubles of the American auto sector all the way through to 2008, 2009. There is a constituency there which is clearly facing existential questions about its employment prospects in the 21st century.

PAUL SOLMAN: But he’s addressing that constituency.

ADAM TOOZE: That is certainly the promise of his campaign, and the promise of his economic program. This economic program is really the pick-up truck of economic programs, it’s the Ford F-150 of economic programs, it’s macho, it’s heavy industrial, it’s about blue-collar jobs, it’s about the jobs of the 20th century, it’s about manufacturing, it’s about oil and fossil fuels. It’s a deliberate, forceful reassertion of an image of American industrialism that we have inherited from the 20th century.

READ MORE: Yes, trade with China took away blue-collar jobs. And there’s no getting them back.

PAUL SOLMAN: As a historian do you find that anachronistic?

ADAM TOOZE: In some senses I think it’s almost deliberately anachronistic. There’s a retro feel to the Trump program, and one can understand the politics of that at this moment: It speaks to a constituency that’s underserved. I think if one wanted to make sense of this program, it’s a kind of holding action, it’s an effort to bide time for a constituency of workers who have really been suffering in the last 20 years and who need to be prepared and be given time to prepare for a transition to a very different type of employment that we may be moving into in the coming decades.

PAUL SOLMAN: So it’s buying time for the children of these people while they continue to have jobs that are essentially going to disappear anyway?

“[Trump’s economic program is] a deliberate, forceful reassertion of an image of American industrialism that we have inherited from the 20th century.”

ADAM TOOZE: For the last 20 years, all the way back to the Clinton administration of the 1990s, the question of how we reskill the American workforce for future employment is one of the key issues of economic policy. What will be interesting to see is whether or not we see from the administration initiatives on higher education for this workforce. Because if those kinds of training opportunities are not provided, then I do think this program begins to look like a defensive, holding acting, a rearguard action, buying time for workers who might not otherwise find positions in the 21st century.

As you say, perhaps with their children, this is a launching pad. Without a stable, domestic platform, without a stable home, it’s difficult for kids to make their way into college education. We know that social mobility in the United States over the last generation has slowed down. A lot of that has to do with the fact that the bottom has fallen out of working-class families, which previously might have provided a springboard to higher education in the glory days of American public universities in the ’50s and ’60s. Those kinds of routes out of blue-collar family backgrounds –by way of college education into white collar work — were quite common. And they’ve become increasingly less so in part because of the crisis in manufacturing and in industrial work.

PAUL SOLMAN: But this was the rationale for saving the auto industry, wasn’t it? The Democratic Party’s rationale was, we’ll preserve jobs at least for a while to keep the people who have had them employed.

ADAM TOOZE: I think there’s a real common ground here, in fact. That was an exception within the Obama administration’s economic policy, a crisis that he inherited from the previous administration, and felt it was essential to carry through on. It went hand in hand with really deep restructuring with both GM and Chrysler, but in a sense I think one can see the Trump program as if it were that element of the bailout of 2009, writ very large, and now extended out towards fossil fuels."

But it should have come as no surprise to those who were paying close attention to the economic indicators in the swing states, states that can tip the outcome of a US presidential election because they have a significant number of votes in the Electoral College and neither major political party is guaranteed to win the votes of the state, that decided the election.



Based on polls and historical evidence, a Trump victory was not expected in the states that swung the election in the Republican’s favor: Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Pennsylvania and Michigan have not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, and neither Florida nor Ohio have voted for a Republican candidate since 2004. On the other hand, although North Carolina and Georgia have historically voted for the Republican presidential candidate, polls did not show a definitive winner in either state prior to election day.

Analysis, however, shows that economic performance in most swing states has fallen far below the US average on US President Barack Obama’s watch. This reality contributed to a majority of residents of these states voting for Trump, the candidate who promised economic growth for those “left behind.” While the United States as a whole did fairly well in rebounding from the great recession of 2008, improvements were less evident in states such as Florida, Michigan, Georgia, or North Carolina (Table 1).

Table 1. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis

*Light blue figures are the most significant differences from the US average.

The average annual rate of growth for the US economy from 2008 to 2015 has been 2.7 percent in nominal terms. In contrast, Florida saw only 1.7 percent growth, Michigan fared slightly better at 1.9 percent, and Georgia saw growth of 2.4 percent. In Florida, in particular, growth in the agriculture sector remained, on average, flat, and the level of sectoral output today is nearly the same as it was in 2007. In these states, where total economy average annual growth was increasing at a lower rate than the total economy of the United States, it should have been clear that voters would have supported a candidate who blamed the state of the economy on the current president, spread the message that his opponent would have continued the current economic trend, and promised to reinvigorate the economy in a way that would have improved the quality of life for these voters. What is interesting is that Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was projected to win Michigan, and polls did not indicate a decisive winner in Florida or Georgia.

In addition to the slow economic growth, income per capita also fell in some of the swing states relative to the national average. The US average annual rate of growth of per capita income has been 2.4 percent between 2008 and 2015. Meanwhile, Florida is trailing at 1.5 percent, and Georgia and North Carolina have experienced 1.6 percent growth rate of per capita income. The sense of lagging behind the rest of the US population might have influenced the majority of voters in these states to vote for Trump.

Of particular interest is that with regard to all economic factors analyzed, as they relate to the outcome of the election—total economy, agriculture, manufacturing, per capita income average annual rate of growth, and all industry private sector employees—Florida has improved at a dramatically lower rate, compared to the other swing states analyzed since 2008.

Another interesting state to consider is Ohio. At the most recent count, Trump won this state by approximately 400,000 votes. However, Ohio’s economic growth is not significantly behind that of the national average. That said, Ohio’s private sector employment has grown the least throughout the Obama years of all the states analyzed. Total private employment growth in Ohio is only 0.6 percent, while the total growth of private jobs throughout the United States has been 4.7 percent. Graph 1 shows the job growth in each of the states analyzed between 2007 and 2015 as measured by the percent change in the number of employees in the private sector per state.

Trump defined his campaign around the concept of the many “forgotten people” in the United States who were not experiencing the same economic growth as the rest of the country. Looking at the data, it is evident that these “forgotten people” live in the swing states.

So here are 10 likely consequences of the Trump presidency, divided equally between the good and the bad.

The good news starts with US growth, which will almost surely accelerate above the 2.2% average annual rate during Barack Obama’s second term. This is because the Republican aversion to public spending and debt applies only when a Democrat like Obama occupies the White House. With a Republican president, the party has always been glad to boost public spending and relax debt limits, as it was under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W Bush. Thus, Trump will be able to implement the Keynesian fiscal stimulus that Obama often proposed but was unable to deliver.

The resulting deficits may be described as “supply-side economics”, rather than Keynesian stimulus, but the effect will be the same: growth and inflation will both increase. As the US economy runs into the limits of full employment, additional growth will push inflation higher, but that bad news can wait until 2018 and beyond.

Second, sensible tax reforms, such as an amnesty for multinational companies that repatriate foreign profits, will finally become law. The Republicans’ hegemony will enable easy agreement on tax cuts financed mainly by higher public borrowing, rather than by facing down special interest lobbies’ resistance to the elimination of exemptions and loopholes. These tax reforms will create even bigger budget deficits, which in turn will stimulate more growth and inflation.

A third boost to economic growth will come from deregulation. While battles over energy and environmental laws may dominate the headlines, the biggest economic impact will come from reversing bank regulations. As banks are encouraged to loosen lending standards, especially for middle-income households, an upswing in residential construction and debt-financed consumption should add further growth impetus. Excessive deregulation could cause a re-run of the 2007 financial crisis, but that, too, is a risk for 2018 and beyond.

Fourth, Trump could be good for geopolitical stability, at least in the short term. Trump’s preference for transactional realpolitik over Obama’s liberal interventionism should stabilise relations with Russia and China as the world is divided into spheres of influence. Trump could give Russia freer rein in Ukraine and Syria in exchange for restraint in central Europe and the Baltics. China’s inevitable dominance in Asia could be accepted, provided it avoids outright wars with Japan, Taiwan, and other countries whose security is, in theory, guaranteed by treaties with the US. The Middle East is bound to remain a cauldron of geopolitical unrest; but, even here, Trump’s preference for local strongmen over “democracy promotion” could restore a degree of stability (at the cost of human rights).

Finally, Trump’s election could force Americans to recognise flaws in their own democracy, even as they abandon global “democracy promotion.” The fact that Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2 million could re-energise efforts to reform the electoral college – efforts that already have resulted in the necessary legislation in states representing 61% of the required votes. And the overwhelming opposition to Trump in trend-setting states such as California and New York could encourage their voters to elect legislatures to counteract federal conservatism with progressive state laws on issues ranging from air quality and health care to abortion, treatment of immigrants, and gun control.

Now for the bad news. For the first time since the 1930s, the US has a president who views trade as a zero-sum game. Trump’s protectionist campaign rhetoric may not have been meant literally, but if he fails to deliver any of the trade curbs that he promised, Republicans will suffer a backlash from what is now their core voter constituency, voters in declining industries and regions.

US global leadership is therefore bound to shift away from free trade, globalisation, and open markets. Nobody can predict the full effects of the biggest regime change in global economic management since the 1980s; but they will surely be negative for emerging economies and multinational companies, whose development models and business strategies have assumed free trade and open capital flows.

A second, more immediate, threat stems from enacting large tax cuts and boosting public spending in an economy already nearing full employment, which implies accelerating inflation, higher interest rates, or probably some combination of the two. Given the likelihood of additional trade protectionism and measures to remove immigrant workers, the increase in inflation and long-term interest rates could be quite dramatic. The impact on financial markets will be disruptive, regardless of whether the Fed aggressively tightens monetary policy to pre-empt rising prices or lets the economy “run hot” for a year or two, allowing inflation to accelerate.

With the US economy growing faster than expected and long-term interest rates rising, excessive strengthening of the dollar is a third major risk. Even though the dollar is already overvalued, it could move into a self-reinforcing upward spiral, as it did in the early 1980s and late 1990s, owing to dollar debts accumulated in emerging markets by governments and companies tempted by near-zero interest rates.

Fourth, the combination of a dollar squeeze and protectionism spells big trouble for developing countries, with the possible exception of some relatively closed economies such as Brazil, Russia, and India, whose development strategies are less reliant on free trade and foreign financing.

Finally, the most dangerous consequence of Trump’s victory may be its contagion effect on Europe. Just as Britain’s referendum proved uncannily predictive of Trump’s win, Trump looks like a leading indicator of populist upheavals in Europe, which could trigger another euro crisis and threaten the breakup of the European Union. The next anti-establishment victories, according to opinion polls, will be in Italy’s constitutional referendum and Austria’s presidential election. Globalists can only hope that the polls again turn out to be wrong – but in the opposite direction.

But the plan could drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers and risk setting off a trade war — if it’s legal to begin with.

In a series of early-morning tweets Sunday, Trump vowed a 35 percent tax on products sold inside the U.S. by any business that fired American workers and built a new factory or plant in another country.

Trump campaigned on a vow to help American workers but also to reduce taxes and regulations on businesses.

Trump tweets “there will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border.”

He says companies should be “forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake.”

expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016

Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Trump would face a potent legal challenge if he tried to impose taxes, known as tariffs, on specific companies without congressional approval.

Hufbauer also doubts that Trump could identify a group of companies —those that move jobs overseas, then ship goods back into America — for special tariffs. “I’m skeptical,” he says, predicting that courts would block such a move.

University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers saw another problem with Trump’s plan: His proposed tariffs would only hit U.S. companies that build plants overseas. They wouldn’t apply to foreign firms that ship goods to the U.S. “Tariffs are one thing,” Wolfers tweeted. “Tariffs that attack only on U.S. firms are another altogether.”

Trump made the comments three days after he announced that appliance maker Carrier had agreed to reverse its decision to ship 800 jobs from an Indiana factory to Mexico.

During the presidential campaign, he repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs — 35 percent on Mexican imports, 45 percent on Chinese. Tariffs are meant to give homegrown companies a price edge by making their foreign competitors’ products more expensive — and to punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices.

Since Trump’s election, his team has described tariffs as a potential tool to be used to pry concessions from America’s trading partners. “Tariffs are part of the negotiation,” Wilbur Ross, an investment banker slated to become Trump’s Commerce secretary, told CNBC last week.

Tariffs could prove costly. They are imposed at the border, and importers would likely try to pass along as much of the cost as possible to their customers.

A 45 percent tariff on Chinese-made goods could drive up U.S. retail prices on those goods by an average of about 10 percent, Capital Economics has calculated. Consumers would probably have to pay up because there are few alternatives to Chinese-made for many products. China, for instance, produces about 70 percent of the world’s laptops and cellphones.

Taxing foreign goods could also start a trade war. The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper, has already warned that China could retaliate by limiting sales of U.S. cars and iPhones and by ordering aircraft from Europe’s Airbus instead of America’s Boeing.

In 2009, the Obama administration taxed Chinese tires to protect American tire makers from a surge in imports. Beijing retaliated with a tax of up to 105 percent on U.S. chicken parts.

Researchers at the Peterson Institute found that the tire tariffs probably saved 1,200 jobs in the U.S. tire industry. But higher tire prices cost American consumers an extra $1.1 billion — more than $900,000 for every job saved.

He says companies should be “forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake.”"

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Many political analysts have tried to pinpoint the reasons why Donald Trump, a political outsider, has won the Republican party's presidential nomination. A new Gallup analysis offers one clue: Americans who view Trump favorably are significantly more likely than other Americans to report feeling financially insecure. The large gap in financial insecurity persists even after controlling for income, education, occupation, party affiliation and various other measures of objective economic circumstances.

This analysis is based on interviews conducted July 2015 through August 2016 as part of Gallup Daily tracking. Over this period, Gallup asked a random sample of U.S. adults two of the eight questions measuring financial worry, shown below.

Gallup U.S. Financial Anxiety Index Questions Measuring Financial Worry 1 You are watching your spending very closely. 2 Would you be able right now to make a major purchase, such as a car, appliance or furniture, or pay for a significant home repair if you needed to? 3 At this time, are you cutting back on how much money you spend each week, or not? 4 Are you feeling pretty good these days about the amount of money you have to spend, or not? 5 Did you worry yesterday that you spent too much money, or not? 6 You have more than enough money to do what you want to do. 7 Do you have enough money to buy the things you need, or not? 8 Are you feeling better about your financial situation these days, or not? Items 1, 3 and 5 are coded as affirmative if respondent agrees, whereas the others are coded as affirmative if respondent disagrees. Gallup Daily tracking, July 2015-August 2016

Americans with a favorable opinion of Trump report relatively high levels of financial anxiety across seven of eight survey questions when compared with those holding an unfavorable view of Trump. For example, those with a favorable opinion of Trump are 23 percentage points more likely to say they are not feeling better about their financial situation these days, 17 points more likely to say they do not feel good about the amount of money they have to spend and 13 points more likely to say they are cutting back on spending.

Republicans and conservatives have reported higher levels of financial insecurity than Democrats and liberals since at least 2013, but these party and ideological differences do not account for the gap in financial insecurity between those who do and do not favor Trump. Republicans who view Trump favorably are still more likely to express economic insecurity on each item than Republicans who view him unfavorably.

For example, 59% of Republicans who have a favorable view of Trump report that they do not feel good about the amount of money they have to spend, compared with 45% of Republicans who have an unfavorable view of Trump. Republicans who have a favorable view of Trump are also 15 points more likely than fellow Republicans who do not favor Trump to say they are not feeling better about their financial situation these days.

Differences between columns 3 and 4 are significant. Gallup Daily tracking, July 2015-August 2016

Financial Insecurity Particularly High Among Affluent Trump Supporters

Financial anxiety is generally lower among those with higher household incomes, but across income groups, those who view Trump favorably are more likely to be worried about their personal finances.

The largest gaps in worries about personal finances tend to be found in households earning $200,000 or more in annual income. Among these affluent households, 51% of those who favor Trump say they don't have enough money to buy what they want, compared with just 31% of those who do not favor Trump. Those who favor Trump are also twice as likely as those who do not favor Trump to report that they are not feeling better about their financial situation (52% vs. 25%). Similar differences occur on the other financial questions tested.

The differences in financial worry between those who do and do not favor Trump are smaller among households with annual income below $100,000, although even within this group, statistically significant gaps remain for seven of the eight questions.

Heightened Insecurity Not Readily Explained by Objective Circumstances

Donald Trump has a more positive image among people who worry about their finances, no matter how grounded those concerns are in the apparent reality of their circumstances.

The financial insecurity gap between those who do and do not view Trump favorably cannot be explained by income or other objective economic and social circumstances. The relationship between viewing Trump favorably and feeling financially insecure holds even after statistically controlling for individual factors such as age, veteran status, gender, race, ethnicity, employment status, education, occupational category, religion, party affiliation and ideology.

Likewise, the gap remains even after taking into account the local cost of living, the average income of people living in the respondents' ZIP codes and income growth in those ZIP codes. For additional details on other variables included in this analysis, see the survey methods section.

It is unclear what is behind the significant relationship between the high levels of financial insecurity and having a favorable opinion of Trump. It may be that there are unmeasured economic factors or experiences not considered here that explain the correlation, or the financial insecurity gap may be attributable to other differences -- such as knowledge, media consumption, cultural practices or some other factor -- between those who favor Trump and those who do not.

Survey Methods

Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted July 8, 2015, through August 31, 2016, on the Gallup U.S. Daily tracking survey, with a random sample of 112,995 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. All reported means and statistical significance include computed design effects for weighting.

Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 60% cellphone respondents and 40% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.

To conduct further analysis, the responses to each of the eight questions were standardized and summed to create a financial insecurity index. This index was analyzed as a dependent variable in a regression that controls for whether someone favors Trump and a number of individual and geographic-level controls, including mean income at the ZIP code level as reported in IRS records, ZIP code income growth from 2013 to 2014, the share of ZIP code income from social security, the ratio of mortgage interest payments to income, average capital income in the ZIP code, the percentage of tax returns with capital income, the area's share of jobs in manufacturing in 1999 and job growth from 2000 to 2015. The cost of living, which was also included, was calculated by dividing median gross rent in the respondent's commuting zone to U.S. median gross rent. Many of these variables predicted higher or lower anxiety, but they did not account for the anxiety of Trump supporters. The Trump variable remained highly positive and significant as a predictor of financial insecurity for the general index and each subitem.

Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate it.

And I’d like to thank the owner of the plant, Gabe and Gloria. You’re here someplace. Thank you.

I want to thank Rick Santorum, our senator, great senator for being here and for the endorsement. We really appreciate it. And I have to say, all of the amazing workers. Gabe said they are the most important. The amazing workers. And I know you have been through some very, very tough times, but we’re going to make it better and we’re going to make it better fast, OK? Just watch.

So today I’m going to talk about how to make America wealthy again. We have to do it. With 30-miles from Steel City, Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation. The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our a great American landscape.

But our workers’ loyalty was repaid, you know it better than anybody, with total betrayal. Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization, moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. Globalization has made the financial elite, who donate to politicians, very, very wealthy. I used to be one of them.

I hate to say it , but I used to be one. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache. When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians have proven, folks, have proven they do nothing.

For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into Depression-level unemployment. Many of these areas have never recovered and never will unless I become president.

Then, they’re going to recover fast. Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families. Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they love shipped thousands and thousands of miles away.

Many Pennsylvania towns, once thriving and humming, are now in a state of total disrepair. This wave of globalization has wiped out totally, totally, our middle class. It does not have to be this way. We can turn it around and we can turn it around fast.

But if we are going to deliver real change, we’re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations, media leaks and political dynasties. The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything and say anything to keep things exactly the way they are.

The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge, nothing is going to change. The inner cities will remain poor. The factories will remain closed. The borders will remain open. The special interests will remain firmly in control. Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small.

And they want to scare the American people out of voting for the better future. And you have a great future, folks. You gave a great future. These people have given her tens of millions of dollars. My campaign has the absolute opposite message. I want you to imagine a much better life and a life where you can believe in the American dream again. Right now, you can’t do that.

I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who led us from one financial and foreign policy disaster to another. Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders.

I was on the right side of that issue, as you know, with the people. I was there. I said it was going to happen, I felt it. While Hillary, as always, stood with the elites and both she and President Obama predicted that one, and many others, totally wrong.

Now, it’s time for the American people to take back their future. Going to take it back.

That’s the choice that we face. We can either give into Hillary Clinton’s campaign of fear or we can choose to believe again in America.

Very sadly, we lost our way when we stopped believing in our country. America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer. You know that from right here, right in this plant.

The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle-class the world has ever known. But then, America changed its policy from promoting development in America — in, in, in America — to promoting development in other nations. That’s what’s happening and that’s what’s happened.

We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable, and our politicians did nothing about it. Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result. I have visited cities and towns across this country where one-third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years. Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export. We can’t continue to do that. This is not some natural disaster, it’s a political and politician-made disaster. Very simple. And it can be corrected and we can correct it fast when we have people with the right thinking. Right up here. It is the consequence… It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism. This is a direct affront to our founding fathers, who — America wanted to be strong. They wanted this country to be strong. They wanted to be independent and they wanted it to be free.

Our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians, believe me.

George Washington said that the promotion of domestic manufacturing will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government. Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the expediency of encouraging manufacturing in, in, in the United States.

And listen to this. The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that, quote, “the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.” He understood it much better than our current politicians, that’s why he was Abraham Lincoln, I guess.

Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production.

Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we’ve turned things completely upside down. We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death and then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free. How stupid is this? How could it happen? How stupid is this?

As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to declare our economic independence once again. That means…

That means voting for Donald Trump.

I’ll do it. No doubt about it. Not even a little doubt. It also means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years. America has lost nearly 1/3 of its manufacturing jobs since 1997. Even as the country has increased its population, think of this, by 50 million people. At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.

First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the disaster called NAFTA. Second, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. NAFTA was the worst trade deal in the history – it’s like – the history of this country. And China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest job theft in the history of our country.

It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA. People don’t remember. In 1993. And Hillary Clinton who supported it. And the havoc that it wreaked after he left office was unbelievable. It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China’s disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible, terrible agreement.

Then as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to the trade deficit, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.

And I have been talking about China for many years. And you know what? Nobody listened. But they are listening now. That, I can tell you.

The city of Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have lost 1/3 of their manufacturing jobs since the Clinton’s put China into the WTO. 50,000 factories across America have shut their doors in that time. And this factory, because of your great owners, Gabe and Gloria, it’s hanging in. Hanging in. But they just told me, it is not easy.

Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result and it’s the result of trade with China. It was also Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea, as reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May . This deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs.

As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs.

Trade reform and the negotiation of great trade deals is the quickest way to bring our jobs back to our country.

To understand why trade reform creates jobs, and it creates a lot of them, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper. Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product. From 1947 to 2001, a span of over five decades, our inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product grew at a rate of 3.5 percent. However, since 2002, the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports, the GDP growth rate has been cut in half.

But is this mean for Americans? Not good. For every 1 percent of GDP growth, we failed to generate in any given year, we failed to create over one million jobs.

What a waste, and what a sad, sad thing.

American’s job creation deficit, due to slower growth since 2002, is well over 20 million jobs. And that is just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages. Wages are very low, because there is no competition. And they are going to go up, because we’re going to thrive again as a country.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership is the greatest danger yet. The TPP, as it is known, would be the death blow for American manufacturing. It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own. It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters — cheaters, that’s what they are, cheaters.

They are not playing by the rules. They are cheating. It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into United States markets, while allowing foreign countries to continue putting up barriers in front of our exports — which is what they do. It is very hard to export to their countries. They make it very difficult.

We, on the other hand — come on in, everybody. Come on in. Bad leadership.

The TPP would lower tariffs would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas.

That is not all, mark my words. China will enter the TPP through the back door at a later date. They are watching, they are studying. They are not in it now, but are going to be in it. If it is good, they will be there.

By the way, if it is no good, they’ll pass. It’s the same way, always is.

The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest wage countries on Earth. Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence.

That’s what is happening. The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto. These commissions are great for Hillary’s Wall Street funders, who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the outcomes.

It should be no surprise, then, that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Please remember that, especially in November.

She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the gold standard. Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago.

But when she saw my stance — which is totally against — she was shamed into saying she would be against it, too. And I will tell you, it was the same shame that she had recently where she was sort of forced into saying radical “Islamic terrorism,” which she didn’t want to say, but she was shamed into that.

But have no doubt that she will immediately approve it, if it is put before her. And that is guaranteed. Guaranteed.

She will do this, just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street and throughout — throughout her career. Her whole career she has betrayed the American worker. She is trying to put on a good front now, she will betray you again.

Her career and her husband have signed so many disasters and never, ever forget NAFTA. Just never ever forget it, because you know what it’s done and I know what it’s done. And in touring, I’ve seen the devastation that it’s left behind.

Here’s how it would go. She would make a small token change, declare the TPP Pact fixed and ram it through and you will suffer. That is why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with TPP in its current form.

You know what that means. That means like they will make a little two-word change and she will fix it and she will feel great. But she says in its current form, she can rush to embrace it again and she will at the earliest opportunity. If the media doesn’t believe me, I have a challenge for you and Hillary. Ask Hillary if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form.

There’s no way to fix TPP. We need bilateral trade deals. We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down, like TPP does.

A Trump administration will change our failed trade policies, and I mean quickly.

Thank you. Here are seven steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs. Number one, I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.

I am going to appoint the toughest and smartest, and I know them all, trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.

I am going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm you, the American worker.

I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses. And abuse is the right word.

Number four. I’m going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot. Not just a little, by a lot for our workers.

And if they don’t agree to a renegotiation, which they might not because they are so used to having their own way — not with Trump they won’t have their own way.

Then, I will submit under Article 2205 of the NAFTA Agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.

Number five. I’m going to instruct my treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, which should have been done years ago.

Any country that devalues their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the United States, which is many countries, will be met with sharply. And that includes tariffs and taxes.

Number six, I’m going to instruct the U.S. trade representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO.

China’s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO and I intend to enforce those rules and regulations. And basically, I intend to enforce the agreements from all countries, including China.

Seven, if China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful — this is very easy. This is so easy. I love saying this. I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

And when they say trade expansion, they’re talking about other countries, they’re not talking about us because there is no expansion. They get the expansion, we get the joblessness. That’s the way it works. It’s not going to happen anymore.

President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry. I remember. His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45 percent and his tariff to shield America’s semiconductor industry was 100 percent, and that had a big impact, folks. A big impact.

Hillary Clinton and her campaign of fear will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war. You already have a trade war, and we’re losing badly. Badly.

She has it completely backwards. Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible deal after another, from NAFTA, to China to South Korea. It doesn’t matter. No matter where she went, the American worker was hurt and you’ll be hurt worse than ever before if she becomes president of the United States. That, I can tell you.

A Trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people and the American worker. The era of economic surrender will finally be over. It will be over. You’re not going to see it anymore. Well, I can’t guarantee it, because after me, they’ll probably start doing it again. But we will have four and maybe eight great, great productive years and we’ll never go back and we’ll make sure we never go back.

Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. I appreciate it.

A new era of prosperity will finally begin. America will be independent once more. Independent once more. Doesn’t that sound great?

Under a Trump presidency, the American worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them.

We will stand up to trade cheating. Cheating. Cheaters, that’s what they are. Cheaters. We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens the American job.

We will make America the best place in the world to start a business. We’ll hire workers and we’ll open factories and we’ll get rid of these horrible regulations that make it impossible to do business in this country.

This will also include massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses. We will also get rid of all of these rules and all of these problems and all of the bureaucracy which are destroying, absolutely destroying our job creation capacity, which we used to be the best in the world and now we’re getting close to the bottom, folks. We’re getting close to the bottom.

Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we’re one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. We’re also going to fully capture America’s tremendous energy capacity. This will create for our workers, and that’s what we want, for our workers, growth for our economy, and begin reducing our budget deficits which are massive; yearly budget deficits, massive.

Our trade deficits, we don’t even want to talk about it. Our budget deficits are massive.

Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines — and she wants to shut down and she said it just recently — she wants to shut down the miners. I want to do exactly the opposite.

A Trump administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure. And aluminum.

Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State Building, that’s what we’re going to do. It built the Empire State Building. It will be American steel that will fortify America’s crumbling bridges — American steel. It will be American steel.

It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring, soaring into the sky, beautiful sight, more beautiful with American steel. It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities. It will be American hand (ph) that remake this country, and it will American energy mined from American resources, that powers this country.

It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. Nobody else — American workers.

We are going to put American steel and aluminum back into the backbone of our country.

This alone will create massive numbers of jobs, high-paying jobs, good jobs, not the jobs we have today, which everybody agrees are bad jobs. We’re going to create massive numbers of good jobs.

On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America first again.

We are going to make America wealthy again.

We are going to reject Hillary Clinton’s policy of fear and her policy of absolute nonsense, because it’s not working and it’s grossly incompetent, and we can’t take it any longer, and we’re not going to take it any longer.

We are going to embrace the possibilities of change, but real change, not Obama change, real change.

It’s time to believe in the future. It’s time to believe in each other. It’s time to believe in America again. This is how we are going to make America great again for all Americans, for all Americans.

We’re going to make America great again for everyone, greater than ever before. And I promise you if I become president, we are going to be working again. We are going to have great jobs again. You’re going to be so happy. You’re going to be proud of your president. You’re going to be proud, proud, proud of our country once again.

Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much."

I’ve seen some of them before, but that was always with the presumption he was unlikely to win. Now I watch them trying to figure out how he did it, and how the Democrats can rebuild their economic message out of this mess.

His speeches are full of virulent ethnic nationalism, to be sure — that’s what I noticed during the campaign — but he also has a way of approaching the economy that sabotages Democratic positions effectively, even when those positions are strong.

There was a time I assumed if the Democrats “moved left” they could win over the working class, even those who don’t usually vote. Now I realize that this move is far more complicated than simply getting past neoliberalism. With Trump at the helm of the conservative movement for the foreseeable future, creating effective agendas and messages that hit home will be even harder.

Watching Trump with fresh eyes shows that we need to think more clearly about how Democratic proposals assume people will accede to changing social norms, how to convey to voters that the policies pursued by the rich are a problem, how to have clear messaging, how to deal with trade, and how to deal with questions involving wages and power. I don’t have the answers, certainly not here and now; but getting the questions right is the first step.

Talk about jobs, jobs, and more jobs

Trump talked about jobs. All the time. This gets lost in the coverage, which focused on the inflammatory scandals. Listen:

When I win on November 8, I am going to bring back your jobs. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to an end. We will make Michigan the economic envy of the world once again. The political class in Washington has betrayed you. They’ve uprooted your jobs, and your communities, and shipped your wealth all over the world. They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan crumbled. I will end the theft of American prosperity. I will fight for every last Michigan job. — Trump, Michigan, October 31, 2016

It’s the first and most consistent thing he discusses. It’s implied that he’s speaking of a specific kind of job, a white, male, breadwinning manufacturing job. He doesn’t discuss “the economy” and how it could work for all, he doesn’t talk about inequality, he doesn’t talk about automation and service work. He just declares that you will have a high-paying manufacturing job when he is president.

So what? Much of the Democratic platform is based on the assumption that most Americans understand that the kind of political economy he’s talking about, a country filled with high-paying manufacturing positions, has been anachronistic for decades. Family leave, child allowances, and universal pre-K acknowledge that we need to look beyond male breadwinners as the core economic unit. Fight for $15 is about turning service work into a decent, secure, working-class life. Efforts to try to disentangle commodities like health care and retirement from employment start from the premise that many people won’t get such benefits from their jobs. Many voters don’t want to hear this.

Lots of voters don’t dislike the rich

Trump never blames the rich for people’s problems. He doesn’t mention corporations, or anything relating to class struggle. His economic enemies are Washington elites, media, other countries, and immigrants. Even when financial elites and corporations do something, they are a combination of pawns and partners of DC elites.

It’s important to watch that trick, it conceals who has agency under runaway inequality. From a June speech in western Pennsylvania: “Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization, moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.” The rich buy politicians (and Trump, of course, can’t be bought!) but he doesn’t turn around and denigrate those rich people.

Trump was smart to take this approach. As the University of California Hastings law professor Joan C. Williams noted in an important essay, “the white working class (WWC) resents professionals but admires the rich.” The WWC doesn’t encounter rich people, but “professionals order them around every day. The dream is not to become upper-middle-class, with its different food, family, and friendship patterns; the dream is to live in your own class milieu, where you feel comfortable — just with more money.”

Now even if the WWC doesn’t resent the rich, Trump is likely to test that by appointing billionaires and Goldman Sachs alumni to his administration. But there’s a reason his appointments aren’t sounding alarm bells right away, and it has to do with that logic of aspiration. The media could have done a better job of explaining how Trump’s tax plan worked — hint: it’s not populist — but both the media and Democratic establishment failed to appreciate this deeper, consistent message.

We’ll need to do better putting populist energy against the bosses and owners. The mechanical, bloodless algebra of Piketty and income statistics won’t be enough by themselves. We need a story of owners and investment to go with it. We need to talk about monopoly power, and the harms it causes, especially as Trump doesn’t take it up.

Meanwhile, we should feel out our own case against professionals. Tying professionals to commodification, the people who get in the way of needed goods — especially with whatever TrumpCare ends up looking like — might be one way to go.

Policy, policy everywhere, nor any drop to drink

Trump and his team were a mess on campaign discipline. But when it came to the economic platform in his speeches he remained disciplined and clear: He’s going to crush undocumented workers, roll back globalization, and cut taxes and regulations in DC. He has catch phrases and symbols for each (the wall, rip up trade deals, drain the swamp), and it’s easy for his (white) voters to imagine how those line up with a better economic situation for themselves. As I’ve emphasized, this is what policy is, and Trump was fantastic at it.

What were Clinton’s three things to benefit workers? There was policy everywhere, but none of it was clear to voters. An infrastructure deal — though would that even happen and didn’t Obama already try that? Anyway, Trump promised to do it twice as big. After that it wasn’t clear what was a priority.

Stuff that actually would affect workers’ lives was presented in a technocratic and vague way. Clinton spoke of “short-termism” instead of bosses who would rather give money to shareholders than invest in their companies and workers. “Shadow banking” instead of “Wells Fargo was ripping you off and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stopped it.” I use these terms too — they are useful when talking to other economists — but I’m not running a political campaign.

The sheer volume of Clinton’s small-bore policy proposals blurred out potentially useful items. When a really important fact sheet on fighting monopoly power was released, it got a paragraph 4,000 words into one speech (“As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don’t keep getting bigger and bigger”). It disappeared into a list of her policies, rather than becoming a rallying cry. We need to remember that a narrative of what has happened to workers and how we are going to fix it is more important than covering every potential policy base.

The economists’ way of talking about trade does not translate

Trump is unapologetically against trade that harms American workers. I would have assumed he was fighting a straw man here, but one thing I’ve learned is that a certain class of liberal doesn’t approach job loss from trade with a regrettable sense of the trade-offs, but instead a more absolutist belief that Americans don’t have any claim on the jobs that go away anyway. It’s all for the best, in the long run.

When it came to the economic platform in his speeches, Trump was disciplined and clear: He’s going to crush undocumented workers, roll back globalization, and cut taxes and regulations in DC. What were Clinton’s three things to benefit workers?

The brilliant economist David Card gave me a useful point here during an interview: The divide among economists on trade is driven by the fact that labor economists study the real effects of unemployment on real people, where trade and macroeconomists treat people as just another commodity. (One of the people who broke the consensus on the effects of trade with China — who highlighted some of the negative effects — was David Autor, a leading labor economist.)

I’d phrase it this way: Are people just like a barrel of oil? In the abstract models of trade economists, commodities like oil will always get sold at some price, they will get to where they need to get to do so, and they’re largely indifferent on the process. Even when commodity markets are off, oil can sit in tankers floating in the ocean waiting out price moves, and it makes no difference to the oil.

Oil doesn’t experience unemployment as the most traumatic thing that can happen to it. Oil moves magically to new opportunities, unlike people who don’t often move at all. A barrel of oil doesn’t beat their kids, abuse drugs, commit suicide, or experiencing declining life expectancy from being battered around in the global marketplace. But people do, and they have, the consequences persist and last, and now they’ve made their voices heard. It’s the dark side of the political theorist Karl Polanyi’s warning against viewing human being as commodities.

For the life of me I don’t know why President Obama spent the summer of 2016 fighting hard for TPP when it was clear it was hurting Hillary Clinton, making her promise to pause trade deals not credible, and giving Trump live ammo. But he did. I don’t know if Trump or the people around him will be smart enough to use trade to split workers away from the Democrats much harder than they have, or if Democrats can come up with a better answer on trade and industrial policy that what they’ve done. But this is a live issue.

Jobs and wages are easier to talk about than transfers and the safety net — for better and worse

Trump also never mentions poverty. And while he talks a lot about reducing taxes, he never talks about increasing transfers, redistribution, or access to core goods. He talks about wages, full stop. He also talks about places. Dying towns that need revitalizing.

Democratic policy centers on poverty and transfers. There are a lot of reasons for this. Obviously, people in poverty are worse off than others, and there are philosophical reasons to want a market system that allows for inequality as long as it benefits the worst-off in society.

But another reason is that you can measure transfers. I’m part of a group that wants to focus on getting wages up (a goal that can be described using the ugly term “predistribution”) as a distinct yet complementary program to redistribution and also something that builds broader power for people. One obstacle I hit is that while getting wages up is a hazy and complicated process, redistribution can be done and measured with clinical precision.

It can also be taken away with that same precision. Trying to reduce “post-tax-and-transfer” inequality, the tactic that the left has been cheering as the way forward, is going to be a major casualty in the next four years — probably the next 10 months even. It will lose out conceptually, since the Trump administration doesn’t think that way at all, and it will lose out practically, as the conservatives destroy transfers and progressive taxation. Getting a clearer strategy and narrative around pushing wages up, and getting a fuller agenda around places left behind, needs to be central to Democratic policy.

Where to go from here?

There are a lot of reasons Clinton lost. There was some made-up wishful thinking in retrospect: Her unfavorables were “priced-in,” I heard, which isn’t a thing. What I haven’t seen an answer for is that for all the money and tech, the pollsters in Brooklyn HQ failed to see that the blue wall was much less safe than projected. Something broke down there and it’s urgent to understand why.

But even without that loss there would have been a need to reboot. As the reporter Ezekiel Kweku writes in an excellent article for MTV News, “The lesson we should draw from Clinton’s loss is not that white supremacy is unbeatable at the polls, but that it’s not going to beat itself.… If the Democratic Party would like to keep more Donald Trumps from winning in the future, they are going to have to take the extraordinary step of doing politics.” Politics is informed by analysis and policy, and though it is clear we need policy to move beyond neoliberalism, that is only the first step. The journey to find this new path is just beginning.

In order to get a full grasp of where he stands, we've broken down the ideas of Republican nominee Donald Trump based on proposals on his websites and statements he's made. We've also included analysis of the proposals by economists.

In the first debate, Trump said the economy was in a ""bubble"" sustained by the Federal Reserves low interest rate policy. He claimed that nothing had grown in the economy since the financial crisis except stock prices and the debt. Thus, the minute Obama ""hits the gold course"", as Trump said, the Fed will raise rates and the entire economy will collapse.

Trump, paradoxically, has also said that high interest rates are bad.

As for the rest of the issues, check out Trump's stances below.

Taxes

Trump's plan would move all Americans into three tax brackets, down from the current seven. The top bracket for married joint filers making more than $225,000 a year would pay 33%; the $75,000-to-$225,000 bracket would pay 25%; and the under-$75,000 bracket would pay 12%. Right now, people who make under $75,00o pay a 15% rate, while the top bracket — made up of those making $466,950 — pays 39.6%.

Trump would cut the corporate tax rate to 15%. It now sits at 39%, but many companies pay much less in their effective tax rate. The average effective tax rate for S&P 500 companies is 29%, according to research by Goldman Sachs.

According to the Tax Policy Center, Trump's plan would incentivize investment by businesses and individuals, but the benefits would be offset unless there was a significant decrease in federal spending. Currently, Trump's plans indicate that he would increase spending.

""However, unless it is accompanied by very large spending cuts, it could increase the national debt by nearly 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts,"" said the Tax Policy Center's report.

Job Growth

Trump does not have a specific plan on creating job growth, but his policy positions are designed to increase jobs in the US. For instance, Trump wants to decrease regulation on energy production to create mining and energy-related jobs, which have been decreasing in recent years.

""We are also going to fully capture America’s tremendous energy capacity,"" said Trump in a speech on June 28. ""This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines.""

Also, Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare, which he said would save 2 million jobs over the next 10 years. Trump has also stated that his trade polices will lead to more manufacturing and goods-based jobs in America.

Regulation on Wall Street

Trump has called for a repeal of the Dodd-Frank regulation that grew out of the financial crisis, saying it has prevented banks from lending money to average Americans. Additionally, Trump has called for a ""pause in all new regulation"" and a review of existing regulation, which would appear to include regulation on Wall Street.

Related story

Trump has been critical of hedge fund managers, saying they ""get away with murder."" But it is unclear what he would do to address the issue. In his economic vision on the campaign website, there is no mention of either Wall Street or Dodd-Frank.

Trade

Trump has been mostly protectionist, saying that existing trade deals have taken manufacturing out of the country while railing against free-trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). At one point in the campaign, Trump suggested a 45% tariff on all Chinese imports. While he later went back on the idea, Trump has been adamant in his assertion that China is ""sucking us dry.""

""When Donald J. Trump is president, China will be on notice that America is back in the global leadership business and that their days of currency manipulation and cheating are over,"" readsthe Trump campaign's website. ""We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.""

Advertisement

Trump believes that negotiating new deals could be beneficial, and the US could ""win"" at trade under his presidency.

""Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,"" said Trump told Reuters in May.""It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop.""

In the first debate, Trump railed against Clinton for her husband Bill's passage of NAFTA calling it the ""worst thing to ever happen to the manufacturing industry.""

Fiscal Policy

One area where both candidates seem to agree is the need to rebuild infrastructure in American through federal spending.

Advertisement

Trump's campaign does not provide a full infrastructure plan, but he has said that he will spend $500 billion on infrastructure to stimulate the economy and provide growth.

""[Twenty-eight] percent of our roads are in substandard condition and 24 percent of bridges are structurally deficient or worse,"" reads the website. ""Trump’s plan will provide the growth to boost our infrastructure, Hillary Clinton’s will not.""

What economists say

A number of Wall Street researchers have weighed in on the economic plans of Trump.

Economists have taken a more extreme view of Trump's plans. Most economists have warned that there could be serious negative shocks to the country's economy under a Trump economic plan.

Kevin Logan, chief US economist at HSBC, said that the implementation of Trump's trade policies would lower exports and increase the cost of goods in the US, which would be a serious shock to economic growth.

""While tax cuts that were implemented in the first year of a Trump administration might give GDP a short-term boost for a year or so, the combined supply shock from a contraction in the labor force and from the disruption to international trade would likely put the economy into a recession after a year or two,"" said Logan in a note to clients.

Both Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's analytics, and William Buiter, chief economist at Citi, agreed that the combined trade shock and increased deficit from the full implementation of Trump's plans would lead to a recession.

Oxford economists estimated that Trump's plans would lose the US $1 trillion, and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania said Trump's immigration planwould cost the US 4 million jobs.

On the other hand, Larry Kudlow, an economist and commentator for CNBC, has said thatTrump's tax plans would be stimulative for the economy. Kudlow has compared Trump's tax cuts to those under President John F. Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan, noting that both of those instances led to 5% GDP growth. Kudlow has, however, criticized Trump's immigration and trade policies.

Additionally, a number of business leaders, such as T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn, have said that Trump's stance on regulation would increase business investment."

“Over the next 10 years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5 percent growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math. It works,” Trump said. Moments later, Trump told the crowd at the nonpartisan Economics Club of New York he thought his team could surpass 4 percent annual growth. ""My great economists don't want me to say this, but I think we can do better than that.”

Trump’s proposal is ambitious -– the nation hasn’t seen 3.5 percent annual growth since 2004 and 4 percent growth since 2000. The country has hovered around 2 percent growth since the recession, and economists have called previous Republican calls to double growth unrealistic.

Trump said the growth could be achieved through tax reform, massively slashing regulations, rebuilding the nation’s coal and steel industries and renegotiating trade deals. Trump's speech relied heavily on his past economic proposals, and somewhat more realistic proposal for growth. Last year Trump proposed he could hit 6 percent growth.

“Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success,” Trump said in his speech Thursday.

But when pressed to explain and quantify the impressive results he predicted, Trump struggled to offer more details.

“We’re going to unleash tremendous opportunity,” he said in a question-and-answer session after his prepared remarks. “We’re going to unleash a lot with the regulations. We’re going to unleash tremendous number of jobs coming into the country. We’re going to have great cutting, waste, fraud and abuse.”

His speech didn’t reference entitlement reform, something conservative economists widely believe is crucial to lessening the debt and deficit. Trump said significant growth would cut down the deficit.

He blamed Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama for doubling the national debt -– he did not acknowledge the two costly wars that were in progress when the president took office –- and argued that Clinton’s plan would “cost our economy $5 trillion.”

That’s just shy of half what Trump’s tax plan was previously estimated to cost the nation, before he modified it over the summer and later said he would allow parents to fully deduct their childcare expenses.

“You can visit our website, just look at the math, it works,"" Trump said Thursday of his plans."

Clinton's plan calls for increasing taxes for people who make over $5 million a year by 4%, in what her campaign calls the ""Fair Share Surcharge."" Additionally, Clinton would make it so that people making more than $1 million a year do not pay an effective tax rate (after deductions) under 30%.

For corporations, Clinton plans to prevent ""inversions,"" in which companies move their headquarters overseas in order to pay a lower rate, and charge an ""exit fee"" on companies moving their businesses outside the country.

According to the Tax Policy Center, Clinton's plan would decrease investment from the top earners but would also significantly reduce the federal deficit.

""And the proposals would raise marginal tax rates on labor and capital, thus reducing incentives to work, save, and invest among high-income households,"" said the report. ""The proposals would increase federal revenues by $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years and would therefore reduce future deficits and slow, somewhat, the accumulation of public debt.""

Job growth

Clinton has introduced a number of measures to try to produce job growth. In addition to investing in infrastructure and manufacturing, Clinton has emphasized ending ""quarterly capitalism,"" which focuses on returns to shareholders. Clinton aims to get businesses to focus on labor and capital investment by modifying capital-gains taxes, giving tax credits for long-term investments and new hires, and ""shedding a light"" on excessive stock buybacks.

""And here’s something that you don’t always hear enough of from Democrats: a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay,"" Clinton said in a speech on August 11. ""And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our private investments.""

Trump does not have a specific plan on creating job growth, but his policy positions are designed to increase jobs in the US. For instance, Trump wants to decrease regulation on energy production to create mining and energy-related jobs, which have been decreasing in recent years.

Regulation on Wall Street

Clinton has said that she would strengthen regulation on financial institutions and also crack down on nonfinancial lending from the ""show banking"" sector. Additionally, Clinton's plan calls for reducing compensation to executives at financial institutions in the event of fines from regulators.

""While institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences — or none at all, even when they’ve already pocketed the gains,"" said Clinton in a speech on July 13. ""This is wrong, and on my watch, it will change.""

Trump, on the other hand, has called for a repeal of the Dodd-Frank regulation that grew out of the financial crisis, saying it has prevented banks from lending money to average Americans. Additionally, Trump has called for a ""pause in all new regulation"" and a review of existing regulation, which would appear to include regulation on Wall Street.

""We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.""

Trump believes that negotiating new deals could be beneficial, and the US could ""win"" at trade under his presidency.

Meanwhile, Clinton does not have a specific trade plan but has pledged to fight the TPP, a deal she once helped to create. In general, Clinton has shifted from pro free trade to something of a trade skeptic.

""My message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" said Clinton during a speech in Michigan in August. ""I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president. As a senator, I fought to defend New York's manufacturers and steel makers from unfair Chinese trading practices.""

Fiscal policy

Both candidates have emphasized the importance of investing in American infrastructure and spending federal money on projects. Trump has said that the country needs to rebuild ""crumbling"" roads and bridges, while Clinton has similarly said that rebuilding infrastructure is key to America's future.

Clinton's plan calls for a five-year, $275 billion investment into a variety of projects, including airport modernization and Wi-Fi accessibility in rural areas.

""So we have to rebuild the infrastructure we have, and we have to build a stronger future together because every community in our country, every single one of them, deserves clean water, clean air, clean energy, and think of the millions of people we can put to work, including some of those laborers right down there in the front,"" said Clinton during a speech in California in July.

Trump's campaign does not provide a full infrastructure plan, but he has said that he will spend $500 billion on infrastructure to stimulate the economy and provide growth.

""[Twenty-eight] percent of our roads are in substandard condition and 24 percent of bridges are structurally deficient or worse,"" reads the website. ""Trump’s plan will provide the growth to boost our infrastructure, Hillary Clinton’s will not.""

What economists say

A number of Wall Street researchers have weighed in on the economic plans of Clinton and Trump. The consensus is that Clinton's plan would roughly maintain the status quo from President Obama's tenure.

""Our expectations for a Clinton presidency do not require changing our outlook for growth, policy, earnings, and inflation,"" said James Sweeney, chief fixed-income economist at Credit Suisse.

If Clinton is able to follow through on all her stated goals, however, it could put pressure on business investment and keep economic uncertainty high enough to curb some growth.

""How left of center Clinton is once in office will determine the degree to which uncertainty drag diminishes post-election,"" wrote Dana Peterson, a North American economist at Citi in a note to clients in August. ""Uncertainty could remain elevated or even increase if Clinton pursues the more populist aspects of her campaign platform (e.g. 'America First' attitude towards trade, aggressively higher taxes, more intense regulation of the financial sector, leaning too hard on China).""

The election of Donald Trump demands a reevaluation of the future of globalization and our earlier optimism that the open global economic order will endure. It is time to consider the possibility that a single politician could reverse decades of global trends. We published a short paper a month ago assessing the claim that globalization was on the verge of a retreat. Our conclusion was relatively sanguine. Based on an assessment of the movement of goods, money, and people across international borders, we found little evidence that globalization is already receding—see Figure 1. We also showed that the global economy is more integrated today than during the peak of the early 20th century, which we interpreted as a repudiation of the claim that globalization had reached unsustainable levels; we are skeptical that such levels exist in a literal sense. Looking to the future, we speculated that the years immediately ahead will be characterized either by stabilization in the level of globalization, or further integration but occurring at a more modest pace than in the past.

Merchandise exports and foreign capital stock are expressed in market dollars as a share of global income expressed in international dollars, and will therefore differ with those cited elsewhere. Full description of sources and methodology are available in this report. How, if at all, does the election of Donald Trump alter our views? It is worth emphasizing that a resistance to globalization was arguably the foremost policy theme in Trump’s election campaign. In the speech announcing his presidential bid, Trump railed against the United States’ existing trade agreements, threatened to slap taxes on U.S. companies investing overseas, and pledged to build a wall to keep out migrants, whom he accused of being rapists. Trump’s plan for his first 100 days in office reaffirms the centrality of this theme, with a commitment to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA, abandon support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), label China a currency manipulator, establish tariffs to discourage companies from off-shoring production and jobs, expel more than two million migrants, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions, and build the wall.

Let’s assume President-elect Trump succeeds in implementing this agenda. We see its effects on globalization playing out at three levels. The first is the direct effect of the U.S. turning inward. The U.S. is the world’s largest economy, measured in market dollars, and its third most populated. A partial withdrawal from the global economy by the U.S. is therefore likely to register in measures of globalized stocks and flows, simply by virtue of the country’s size. Indeed, America holds the largest share of global trade, foreign capital stocks, and migrants. Yet, relative to its size, America is not as globally integrated as many other countries. It is those areas where the U.S. is most globally intertwined, as measured by the vertical axes of Figure 2, that the direct impact of a Trump presidency on globalization could theoretically be greatest. Figure 2: Global shares of trade, capital markets, and migration Authors’ calculations based on Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2014, U.N. 2015a, and World Bank 2016. Capital stock assets include estimates of external debt, foreign direct investment (FDI), and portfolio equity stocks. Full description of sources and methodology are available in this report. For instance, despite the prominence of trade during the election campaign, the U.S. is a relatively closed economy. It accounts for only 11 percent of global trade volumes—far below its 24 percent share of global GDP. That said, this likely understates the country’s footprint in global trade given that the U.S. imports many final goods whose production occurs along international supply chains. By contrast, the U.S. plays a fuller role in global capital markets. Within those markets, the area that may be most directly vulnerable to Trump’s policies is outward foreign direct investment (FDI). The U.S. lays claim to 18 percent of global FDI assets. However, the U.S. is most globalized, relative to other countries, in terms of its openness towards migrants. The country is home to 19 percent of the world’s migrant stock, while accounting for only 4 percent of the world’s population. In fact, the U.S. is the top destination for migrants from 60 countries. The expulsion of large numbers of migrants and greater restrictions on the number of future entrants would directly alter this aspect of the global economy. While the direct effects of the U.S. turning inward on global economic integration are important, they are still likely to be relatively small in terms of the three series presented in Figure 1. Much larger effects are possible in terms of the impact Trump’s policies could have by changing the behavior of other countries. This is the second level at which we see Trump’s effect on globalization unfolding. We may see countries retaliate against U.S. protectionist policies. This is the basis for concerns that Trump could precipitate a trade war. We may see countries retaliate against U.S. protectionist policies. This is the basis for concerns that Trump could precipitate a trade war. The threat has already been made explicit by the state-sponsored Chinese tabloid, Global Times, which proposed that China respond to aggressive trade policies by cancelling contracts with U.S. suppliers, imposing tariffs on U.S. imports, and limiting the number of Chinese students studying in American universities, and by French presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy who has suggested that the Europe Union impose a tax on U.S. products and limit the participation of foreign companies in EU public contracts if Trump withdraws from the Paris climate accord. Countries and their leaders may instead imitate Trump’s policy agenda, whether in pursuit of similar electoral success or on the basis that his election gives his anti-globalization agenda legitimacy. In the past week, politicians from Italy, Hungary, Greece, and elsewhere have invoked Trump’s victory as justification for policies that reverse the pattern of globalization.

Alternatively, countries may repudiate global norms and institutions that underpin the globalized economy, if they feel that the U.S. is no longer committed to upholding the liberal economic order. This reflects the widely held belief that the stability of the existing economic order hinges on the example set by the U.S., as the longstanding global economic hegemon. Such an outcome foreshadows chaos, but with the era of U.S. global economic pre-eminence coming to a close, those norms and institutions, from World Trade Organization membership and rules, to the various U.N. conventions concerning the treatment of migrants and refugees, were always likely to be tested soon. Trump’s election may usher a more rushed transition as emerging markets that have benefited most from the open global economy come to its defense. There is already some evidence of this kind of realignment, as members of the TPP seek to patch together the deal without the U.S., and China makes the case for its alternative regional trade deals. The third and final way in which we interpret the effect of Trump’s election on the future of globalization is the injection of a huge amount of uncertainty. The breaking of globalization’s first wave a century ago is proof that the forces of global economic integration are neither irresistible nor irreversible. The breaking of globalization’s first wave a century ago is proof that the forces of global economic integration are neither irresistible nor irreversible. Trump’s ascent to the White House adds to the evidence, representing the biggest shift in the U.S.’s orientation vis-à-vis the global economic system in the post-war period. This policy discontinuity is a source of uncertainty in and of itself. We have assumed that Trump will deliver on his anti-globalization agenda, yet for now it remains unclear whether he will pursue it in full and what constraints to its implementation will arise. Perhaps the most important risk concerns how he will respond to unanticipated events over the period of his presidency, through the prism of his anti-globalist perspective. This uncertainty alters the way we view the direct and indirect effects of Trump’s policies described earlier by reducing our confidence in them and expanding the range of possible outcomes. Taking these considerations together, our view on globalization’s future has indeed changed. We are much less assured that the open global economic order will endure."

Rural white women were right there in the voting lines with them.

The NBC News national exit poll documented how Trump and his populist message disproportionately appealed to both white men and women living in rural America. A recent survey by Pew Research Center, conducted this spring in association with the Markle Foundation, illustrates the depth of their financial frustrations with the status quo on some key economic measures – anxieties that are more deeply felt by rural whites than by whites living in the nation’s cities or suburbs.

Overall, Trump won small towns and rural America easily on Nov. 8, claiming 62% of the votes while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton received 34%. By contrast, Trump won a more modest 50% to 45% victory in the suburbs while losing handily to Clinton in urban areas 59% to 35%.

The gender gap was a key part of the narrative this election season. Overall, 54% of all women voters said they voted for Clinton, while about the same proportion of men supported Trump (53%), the NBC News exit poll found. But among whites, the story was very different – particularly among men and women living in rural areas or small towns.

Trump won comfortable majorities of both rural white men and women, according to the exit poll. While Trump held a 10-percentage-point advantage over Clinton among white women nationally (53% to 43%), his victory margin nearly triples to 28 points among rural white women (62% to 34%). Trump led Clinton by 32 points among all white men nationally (63% to 31%), but he beat the Democrat by 48 points among white men living in rural areas (72% to 24%).

The Pew Research Center survey, conducted May 25 to June 29, 2016, with a nationally representative sample of 5,006 adults, suggests that the broad economic concerns of rural white Americans align to a striking degree with several key issues that were among the cornerstones of the Trump campaign: jobs, immigrants and fears about an eroding standard of living. Moreover, these anxieties are more deeply felt among rural whites than among whites in the cities or suburbs. Among the issues:

Where are the jobs? Not here. Roughly seven-in-ten rural white residents (69%) say jobs in their communities are hard to find. By contrast, 45% of whites living in urban areas and 54% of those living in the suburbs say it’s difficult to find work where they live, the Pew Research Center survey found. About three-quarters (74%) of rural white women and 64% of rural white men say jobs are scarce. In each case, those shares are significantly higher than those of urban white women and men (50% and 40%, respectively) who say it’s hard to find work in their areas, as well as those of their suburban counterparts (56% of suburban white women and 50% of suburban white men).

Concerns about working immigrants. Most rural white residents (65%) say American workers are being hurt by the growing number of immigrants working in the U.S., compared with about half of urban (48%) and suburban (52%) white residents. Among whites, both rural men and women (65% for both groups) are more likely than urban men (46%) and women (49%) or their suburban counterparts (55% and 49%, respectively) to say immigration has a negative impact on workers.

Pessimism about their children’s financial future. A core tenet of the American dream is the belief that each generation will be better off than the last. Overall, 46% of Americans say they expect their children will be better off than they are, while about a quarter (24%) say their children will be worse off and 19% say their children will enjoy about the same standard of living. But rural white residents are less certain about their children’s future than whites living in cities or the suburbs. A third of rural whites – but only about a quarter of white city dwellers (23%) or suburbanites (28%) – believe their children will have a worse standard of living when they are their age. Rural white men in particular hold this bleak view; among all rural whites, 40% of men but only 27% of women predict a worse standard of living for their children. By contrast and regardless of their gender, about a quarter (23%) of urban whites and roughly three-in-ten suburban whites (28%) are similarly pessimistic about their children’s future, the Center’s survey found.

On other jobs-related issues, there are additional prominent gender gaps among white adults living in rural America. For example, rural white women are far more likely than men to say the federal government has at least some responsibility to ensure that workers have the right training and skills to be successful (67% of women say this compared with 53% of men). In fact, about a quarter of rural white men (23%) say the federal government has no responsibility for worker training and education, a view shared by only 6% of rural white women.

On other measures that did not feature prominently in Trump’s campaign, rural white men stand apart from rural women as well as from white urban and suburban residents. While substantial majorities of men and women see some role for colleges and universities in providing necessary skills and education, rural white men are far less likely than rural white women (71% vs. 92%) to say this. Rural white men are also significantly less likely than urban or suburban white men (82% and 84%, respectively) to see a role for institutions of higher education."

Mnuchin is confirming that he and Ross are joining Trump’s Cabinet, pending confirmation by the Senate.

He tells CNBC’s “Squawk Box” in an interview Wednesday that “we’re thrilled to work for the president-elect and honored to have these positions.”

Mnuchin says “sustained economic growth” is the chief priority of the incoming administration and he says “we can absolutely get to sustained 3 to 4 percent” in the gross domestic product.

He’s also outlining what he calls “the largest tax change” since President Ronald Reagan — cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, a “big” middle-class income tax cut and simplifying taxes.

Mnuchin led Trump’s finance operations during the presidential campaign and became close to the president-elect and his family.

Ross is a billionaire investor who’s considered the “king of bankruptcy” for buying beaten-down companies with the potential to deliver profits."

Fact-Checking Trump's Speech on Trade

The presumptive GOP presidential nominee slammed “a policy of globalization,” that has hurt the middle class and praised voters in Great Britain for choosing to withdraw from the European Union.

“Friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders. I was on the right side of that issue, as you know,” Trump said.

The real estate mogul lumped rival Hillary Clinton with the North American Free Trade Agreement and World Trade Organization, both of which he argued have crippled American manufacturing towns like Monessen, Pennsylvania.

“You will be hurt worse than ever before if she becomes president of the United States,” Trump said of Clinton. “That I can tell you.”"

President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly selected erstwhile rival and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to serve as his energy secretary.

If confirmed, Perry will oversee American energy policy and its ramifications on the economy, environment and national security.

CBS News and other outlets reported the news late Monday night, hours after Perry met with the president-elect in New York. It was the second time Perry had made the trip to Trump Tower.

Trump's transition team did not confirm the report Tuesday morning but praised Perry's time as governor. ""They talk about Texas' economic revival and a lot of that had to do with the energy sector,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters.

Yet Perry has previously supported abolishing the Department of Energy entirely. Famously, during a presidential debate in November 2011, Energy was the third federal agency that Perry couldn't name while trying to list the three he wanted to eliminate.

“It’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone — Commerce, Education and the, um, what’s the third one there? Let’s see,” Perry said, before finally giving up with his now-infamous ""oops.""

On Tuesday morning, Trump aides did not seem concerned with the possibility of selecting someone to lead a department that he had once wanted to eliminate.

""It's [Trump's] agenda that's being implemented, not somebody else's,"" Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said. ""It's not a vice-versa thing where we're buying into their agenda. They're buying into our agenda.""

The appointment marks a full repair in Perry’s relationship with Trump. Perry called Trump “a cancer on conservatism” last year while the two men were in a crowded field for the Republican presidential nomination. But Perry was one of the first members of the Republican establishment to back Trump, once it became clear in May that the real estate mogul had secured the party's nomination.

Perry’s background as governor of Texas, a state rife with natural resources, is a key qualifying credential for the post. But this Cabinet role can go well beyond oil and natural gas. The outgoing secretary of energy, Ernest Moniz, had a physics background and played a central role in President Obama’s Iranian nuclear deal.

While Perry's nomination is not official yet, Texas Republicans began celebrating the news Tuesday morning. U.S. Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis, a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called the former governor an ""excellent choice.""

""Perry possesses a very strong energy background and has a track record of proven executive leadership,"" Barton said in a statement. ""I have known Rick Perry since we were classmates at Texas A&M University, and he has always been a man of character. America is an energy superpower and Gov. Perry’s expertise will be a valuable asset to the administration.""

Some of the reactions were more playful, given Perry's infamous debate flub. The Club for Growth, a conservative group, said it supported Perry for the job — ""and the most important pro-growth step he could take at the Energy Department would be to fulfill his 2012 campaign pledge to eliminate it.""

If confirmed, Perry will be the third Texan to serve as secretary of energy. Previously, Houstonian Charles Duncan served in this role under President Jimmy Carter, as did Laredo native Frederico Peña in the Clinton administration.

Perry will face Senate confirmation once Trump takes office. Republicans control the Senate, making that process all the easier for the president-elect’s nominees.

And yet his most enthusiastic support tended to come from those with average and stagnating incomes and low levels of education. What gives?

Trump’s victory clearly appears to stem from a sense of economic powerlessness, or a fear of losing power, among his supporters. To them, his simple slogan, “make America great again,” sounds like “make you great again”. Economic power will be given to the multitudes, without taking anything away from the already successful.

Those on the downside of rising economic inequality generally do not want government policies that look like handouts. They typically do not want the government to make the tax system more progressive, to impose punishing taxes on the rich, in order to give the money to them. Redistribution feels demeaning. It feels like being labeled a failure. It feels unstable. It feels like being trapped in a relationship of dependency, one that might collapse at any moment.

The desperately poor may accept handouts, because they feel they have to. For those who consider themselves at least middle class, however, anything that smacks of a handout is not desired. Instead, they want their economic power back. They want to be in control of their economic lives.

In the 20th century, communists politicised economic inequality, but they made sure their agenda could in no way be interpreted as creating alms or charity for the less successful. It was fundamentally important that communists take power by a revolution, in which workers unite, take action and feel empowered.

Trump supporters call his triumph a revolution, too, though the violence – at least by the campaign itself – was limited to name-calling and insults. It was still nasty enough, apparently, to inspire those of his supporters who interpret aggressiveness as evidence of power.

It is certainly not just in the US that people desire a sense of vocational accomplishment, rather than simply money to live on. In no country does it feel generally right to respond to rising economic inequality by imposing heavy taxes on the rich and transferring the money to others. That feels like changing the rules of the game after it has been played.

In their recent book Taxing the Rich: A History of Fiscal Fairness in the United States and Europe, Kenneth Scheve of Stanford and David Stasavage of New York University use two centuries of data on tax rates and on income inequality to examine outcomes in 20 countries. They found that there was little or no tendency for governments to make taxes more progressive when pretax inequality increased.

Katherine Cramer, author of The Politics of Resentment, gained some insight into this outcome in Wisconsin, where, like Trump, the state’s governor, Scott Walker, has been popular among working-class voters. After he was elected in 2010, Walker cut taxes on higher incomes, refused to raise the state minimum wage above the federally-mandated minimum, and rejected the insurance exchanges created by Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare reform, which would benefit lower-income people. Instead, Walker promised measures that would take power away from labor unions, actions that usually are perceived as likely to lower working-class incomes.

Cramer interviewed rural working-class voters in Wisconsin, trying to understand why they supported Walker. Her interviewees stressed their rural values and commitment to hard work, which have been a source of personal pride and identity. But they also stressed their sense of powerlessness against those perceived as unfairly advantaged. She concluded that their support for Walker, amid evidence of economic decline, reflected their extreme anger and resentment toward privileged people in big cities, who, before Walker, had ignored them, except to tax them. And their taxes went, in part, to pay for government employees’ health insurance and pension plans, benefits that they themselves often could not afford. They wanted power and recognition, which Walker seemed to offer them.

Such voters are also almost certainly anxious about the effect of rapidly rising information technology on jobs and incomes. Economically successful people today tend to be those who are technologically savvy, not those living in rural Wisconsin or rural anywhere. These working-class voters feel a loss of economic optimism, but admiring their own people and upholding their values, they want to stay where they are.

Trump speaks these voters’ language; but his proposals to date do not seem to address the underlying shift in power. He stresses cutting domestic taxes, which he asserts will unleash a new flurry of entrepreneurism, and renegotiating trade deals in a protectionist direction to keep jobs in the US. Such policies, however, are unlikely to shift economic power to those who have been relatively less successful. On the contrary, entrepreneurs may develop even more clever ways to replace jobs with computers and robots, and protectionism may generate retaliation by trading partners, political instability and ultimately possibly even hot wars.

To satisfy his voters, Trump must find ways to redistribute power over income, not just income itself, and not just by taxing and spending. He has expressed only limited ideas here, like subsidising school choice to improve education. But powerful economic forces such as technological innovation and lower global transportation costs have been the main drivers of increasing inequality in many countries. Trump can’t change this fact.

If those who lack the skills that today’s economy demands refuse redistribution, it is hard to see how Trump will make them better off. The Trump revolution, as it has been presented so far, seems highly unlikely to deliver what his supporters really want: an increase in workers’ economic power.

Speaking in a critical swing state that has struggled with the decline of American manufacturing, Clinton seemed to aim her message at the economically anxious — arguing that Trump is a false prophet who will leave America hurting, just like he has done for countless of people during his business career.

“We cannot let him bankrupt America like we are one of his failed casinos,” Clinton said. “Those promises you're hearing from him at his campaign rallies? Those are the same promises he made to his customers at Trump University. And now they're suing him for fraud. The same people he's trying to get to vote for him are people he's been exploiting for years.”

She pointed to 3,500 lawsuits and hundreds of liens against Trump, including many from people who claim Trump never paid them for services. “He made a fortune filing bankruptcies and skipping creditors,” Clinton added.

She acknowledged that many people are not satisfied with the post-recession economic recovery under President Obama, and skeptical of the trade deals he supports, but she said Trump is not the answer.

The speech was designed as the counterpart to one Clinton gave earlier this month in San Diego, California, bashing Trump on national security.

“You might think that because he has spent his life as a businessman, he might be better prepared to handle the economy. It turns out, he's dangerous there, too,” Clinton said. “Just like he shouldn't have his finger on the button, he shouldn't have his hands on the economy.”

In a change of strategy — perhaps resulting from the ouster Monday of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski — Trump’s campaign fired back at Clinton by sending multiple emails to reporters with detailed responses to her claims.

“How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?” Trump tweeted in response.

For Clinton's part, Tuesday’s speech demonstrated less swagger and contained fewer zingers than the previous one, but she still trashed the man she repeatedly called “Donald” as a reckless cynic who cares only about himself.

“Everything seems to be a game for him,” she said. “This is his one move: He makes over-the-top promises...and then everything falls apart and people get hurt.”

In some ways, Clinton’s message on Trump emulated the one Democrats used to tarnish Mitt Romney in 2012: That he got rich by crushing people's’ dreams and, that if given the reigns of power, would only seek to further enrich himself and his peers at the top of the economic ladder.

In a nod to the left flank of her own party, Clinton mentioned Elizabeth Warren’s name twice, saying that Trump would undo her work reining in wall Street.

Trump’s tax plan, Clinton claimed, would cut rates on hedge fund managers and give more to the 120,000 richest American families than to 120 million working families. ""I did have to look twice, because I didn't believe it,” she said of the statistic.

“Of course, Donald himself would get a huge tax cut under his plan. But we don't know exactly how much because won't' release his tax returns,” she continued, underscoring her attempt to show that Trump’s talk of looking out for the little guy is empty pandering.

Noting that every major presidential nominee in modern history has released his tax returns, Clinton wondered, “What's hiding in Trump's tax returns?"" Maybe he paid a low tax rate, maybe he didn’t give very much to charity, Clinton speculated, or ""maybe he isn't as rich as he claims.""

And perhaps trying to reach Trump-curious voters, she repackaged two divisive issues — immigration and women’s rights — as economic ones that affect everyone, rather than discussing them in moralistic terms.

But Clinton added two twists to the playbook used against Romney. First, she said Trump is not even particularly good at making money. “He’s written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at chapter 11,” she said, pointing to the bankruptcies of his casinos and failures of companies like Trump-branded steaks.

Trump has said he is “going to do for the country what I did for my business,” Clinton reminded her audience, and took it as an invitation to detail the low-lights of Trump’s business career. ""The United States of America doesn’t do business Trump’s way.”

And second, Clinton sought to completely disqualify Trump by painting him as an exceptional threat to economy — one that even Romney himself can recognize. This goes beyond “typical political disagreements,” Clinton said. “Liberals and conservatives say Trump's ideas would be disastrous. The Chamber of Commerce and labor unions [agree].”

She noted that The Economist’s Intelligence Unit lists a Trump presidency as the third most dangerous threat to the global economy. “This is like nothing we've ever seen,” Clinton said.

Trump has suggested he would renegotiate or even skip payments on government debt if president, which Clinton said would be an unprecedented break from more than 200 years of American policy. “Alexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave,” she added.

But Clinton said this is typical of someone who has called himself the “King of Debt” while missing many debt payments.

Finally, Clinton wrapped her entire argument into an assertion that Trump fundamentally does not believe in America and its people.

“Donald Trump never misses a chance to say Americans — he's talking about us — to say that Americans are losers and the rest of the world is laughing at us,” she said, adding that Trump makes many of his own products in other countries. “Donald Trump believes in the worst of us.”

Clinton did not dwell much on her own policies — she’ll go into more depth on those Wednesday during a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina. Instead, she contrasted her general approach to that of Trump’s.

""I actually sweat the specifics because they matter,” she said, noting that presidents’ words can move markets. “I have this old fashioned idea that if you're running for president, you should say what you want to do.”

The Republican National Committee, in its first statement directly defending Trump in weeks, said Clinton “is the last person qualified” to talk about the economy. “After eight years of disastrous Obama policies which have produced stagnant wages, historically weak growth, and a declining middle class, Hillary Clinton is doubling down on the same failed agenda,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement."

He grew up surrounded by mining, and politics.

His father and grandfather were proud miners — and staunch Democrats. It got to the point growing up, Vlaisavljevich said, where ""a Republican was a scary thing.""

But now, the 60-year-old is a vocal Trump supporter, with a Trump bumper sticker plastered on the front of his desk at Eveleth City Hall.

""I felt kind of bad, when you grew up with the party, your father, your grandfather, were hard working people, and the party represented them in a very good way,"" he said. ""Now it's drifting away from the values they set up.""

The small-town mayor made headlines during the campaign when he wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper, urging Iron Rangers to back Trump. For him, he said, it was an economic decision. He believes Democrats are too beholden to environmental groups and have become less supportive of mining.

""I thought I'm going to go with the one I thought best represents our interests,"" Vlaisavljevich said. ""I never thought the Republican Party would be the working man's party.""

While Democrat Hillary Clinton still carried the Iron Range as a whole, Trump made huge inroads in the area, which usually votes overwhelmingly Democratic. Trump carried Hibbing, the area's largest city, by seven votes. And he came within 120 votes of beating Clinton in Virginia, the other major hub on the Iron Range.

The Iron Range economy is stagnant: Some mining facilities have been closed for nearly two years, downtown storefronts are boarded up and voters are frustrated.

Across the Rust Belt of the Upper Midwest, from Ohio to Wisconsin to the Iron Range, voters who sided with President Barack Obama in recent elections instead took their chances on Trump this year.

""I'm one of them people that is a firm believer in the better the economy the better the country,"" said 19-year-old Britton Show, who's studying auto mechanics at Hibbing Community College. ""Being that he's one of the richer men in the world, I figure he knows what to do with his money.""

That reasoning mystifies Cliff Tobey. He's president of Steelworkers local union 2660 in Keewatin, where Keewatin Taconite has been closed for a year and a half.

""I understand how angry American workers are, I feel that same anger,"" he said. ""What I don't understand is how people think a system that seems to give all the advantages to the ultra-wealthy, why people would think that electing someone that's part of that category is somehow going to change their plight in life.""

All local unions on the Iron Range endorsed Clinton. But a mineworker who didn't want to be interviewed said that while the union leadership at his mine supported Clinton, many of the rank-and-file workers quietly backed Trump.

So did many other Range voters who typically vote Democratic.

""Something's got to change where something has to come in up here, where there's more work for people at a good wage, not just a minimum wage, but a good wage where people can make a living so they can put money back in the economy,"" said John Jylha, 60, of Hibbing.

He's not sure he made the right choice, but he's hoping a change in Washington can help jumpstart mining and the local economy.

Still, on the Iron Range, most local and state DFLers easily won reelection.

Democratic Congressman Rick Nolan beat back a stiff challenge from Republican Stewart Mills.

But Trump connected with Iron Range voters in a way other GOP candidates didn't, said Vlaisavljevich, the Eveleth mayor.

""Growing up on the Iron Range,"" he said, ""Donald Trump talked just like the old-timers. And Donald Trump would just tell you, if you like it or not, he's telling it. And that's kind of the people I grew up with. They gave it to you whether you liked it or not, and it was the truth.""

Still, Vlaisavljevich said, if the DFL goes back to its roots, to sticking up for blue collar workers, he believes Iron Range voters will return to the Democratic party.

""If the DFL drifts back to what it was,"" he said, ""they're probably going to be the brand of choice."""

So declared voters in Tuesday's historic election, which saw the billionaire businessman defy the polls to claim the presidency.

The economy: Nearly two-thirds of voters said the nation's economic condition is poor or not so good, according to CNN exit polls. And these folks voted for Trump by a 2-to-1 margin.

Some 36% think the economy is in excellent or good shape. Hillary Clinton secured 77% of voters who feel this way, compared to 18% for Trump.

When it comes to who would handle the economy better, voters flocked to Trump.

Some 49% of those who went to the polls said he'd do a better job, while 46% selected Clinton.

Trade: America's trade deals were a major issue throughout the campaign, with Trump hammering home that the U.S. has entered into bad agreements that have cost Americans their jobs.

And more of the electorate believed him than didn't. Some 42% said trade hurts employment, compared to 38% who said it creates more jobs. Trump secured the support of those who feel negatively about trade by a 65% to 31% divide.

Trade was an important issue for voters in the key Rust Belt states, where Trump campaigned heavily and promised to bring jobs back.

Half of Michigan's electorate feel trade takes away jobs, and these folks supported Trump by a 59% to 36% split. The 31% who think trade creates jobs strongly backed Clinton.

In Ohio, 48% of voters say trade hurts workers, and they lined up for Trump by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The 45% who think it creates jobs or has no effect lined up behind Clinton.

And in Pennsylvania, 53% of the electorate agree that trade is bad for jobs. They heavily favored Trump. Among the 34% who feel trade is a job creator, the reverse was true.

Trump won Pennsylvania and Ohio and is leading in Michigan.

When it comes to their own family's financial situation, only 27% said they are in worse shape compared to four years ago. Not surprisingly, these voters cast their ballots for Trump by a 78% to 19% split.

About four in 10 said their family's finances are in about the same shape. They split evenly between Trump and Clinton. Of the 31% who said their situation is better, 72% voted for Clinton and 24% for Trump.

Obamacare: Nearly half of voters said Obamacare went too far, and these folks flocked to Trump by an 83% to 13% split. Of those who feel it was about right or didn't go far enough, Clinton was the heavy favorite.

Income: Trump's strongest supporters were among those earning $50,000 to $100,000. Half cast ballots for him, compared to 46% who backed Clinton.

Higher income Americans generally favored Trump. Those who earn $100,000 or more were slightly more likely to vote for the Republican candidate, whose tax plan would lower their levies. Voters earning less than $50,000 threw their support to Clinton.

Not all of the polling data, however, showed Trump on top when it comes to economic issues.

The economy was by far the most important issue for voters when compared to foreign policy, immigration and terrorism. But those who picked the economy as Issue #1 favored Clinton by a 52% to 42% margin."

Ross, 79, is the chairman and chief strategy officer for WL Ross & Co., a private equity firm that restructures companies in financial straits. Ross, whose net worth is estimated at $2.9 billion, largely made his money from investments and his time at the financial advisory group Rothschild Inc., where he worked for 24 years before starting his own investment firm.

During the campaign, Ross was Trump’s chief economic adviser on trade policy.

If Ross is confirmed by the Senate, he would become a key player in implementing Trump’s economic agenda. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to create 25 million new jobs in the next decade and achieve 3.5 percent economic growth per year — substantially higher than the 2.4 percent GDP increase the country experienced in both 2014 and 2015.

“Wilbur knows that cutting taxes for working families, reducing burdensome government regulations and unleashing America’s energy resources will strengthen our economy at a time when our country needs to see significant growth,” Trump said in a statement.

In a statement released by the Trump transition team on Wednesday, Ross said he was looking forward to working “especially closely” with Steve Mnuchin, a financier who was nominated on Wednesday as treasury secretary, to “implement the President-elect’s strategy for accelerating our economic growth.”

During the campaign, however, Ross and Trump did not always see eye-to-eye. In an interview with CNBC last June, Ross said he did not take all of Trump’s campaign promises literally — such as a claim, which Trump later retracted, that he could eliminate the country’s $19 trillion debt in 10 years.

“If you add up all the promises any politician makes, the math doesn’t work,” Ross said at the time. “Hillary Clinton’s math doesn’t work, Donald’s math probably doesn’t work. I think you have to listen to their campaign pitches more as symbolic, more as metaphors.”

Ross has restructured more than $200 billion in liabilities, often for steel, textile and coal mining companies. At times, he has come under scrutiny for those investments.

In 2006, 12 miners died in an explosion at a West Virginia mine owned by Anker Coal. Ross’ company bought an ownership stake in Anker Coal shortly before the company went bankrupt in 2002, and reportedly refused to stop production at the Sago mine despite knowing that the mine needed roof repairs.

Another one of Ross’ notable clients was Donald Trump himself.

In 1990, as Trump was facing more than $3 billion in debt and on the verge of personal bankruptcy, he brought on Ross to help navigate his financial troubles.

Ross originally considered a move to force Trump’s Taj Mahal casino into bankruptcy, but after spending more time with Trump, Ross, who represented bondholders of the casino, said he changed his mind.

“We could have foreclosed [on the Trump Taj Mahal], and he would have been gone,” Ross told the New York Post earlier this year.

Instead, Ross helped Trump and his debt-holders strike a plan that required Trump to liquidate some of his assets and tighten his budget, while lowering his debt and avoiding a total collapse of his real estate empire.

In addition to Trump, Ross has ties to other prominent Republicans. Ross served as an economic adviser to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump supporter who is under consideration for Secretary of State. Ross was also a board member of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund under President Bill Clinton.

Ross has also become a prominent Republican donor. He served as a trustee on Trump’s fundraising committee during the campaign, and also donated money himself.

Ross personally gave the maximum allowed individual donation of $5,400 to Trump’s campaign, and another $139,145 to the Republican National Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign spending.

Ross’ company, WL Ross & Co., donated $336,635 to the Republican National Committee. The company also gave $5,400 to Trump and $6,000 to Hillary Clinton.

Some financial industry watchers reacted to Ross’ nomination with cautious optimism.

Allen Sinai, the chief global economist and strategist of Decision Economics, a research firm, said even though Ross is a financial insider, he brings an outsider’s perspective on politics.

“Ross is bringing business savvy, bottom line, roll-up your sleeves knowledge on how the world really works, and I think that is a breath of fresh air for Washington,” said Sinai, who has advised both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Sinai also touted Ross’ international business experience, though he noted that Ross has less experience in the growing high-tech sector.

“That’s a weakness in his skill set, but we’ll see whether he builds a team around him who are much more knowledgeable in that world,” Sinai said.

Others criticized Trump’s decision to nominate Ross and other business leaders, like Mnuchin, to serve in his cabinet.

“Donald Trump continues to stack his administration with the same insiders and financial elites he railed against during the campaign,” said Mark Paustenbach, the press secretary for the Democratic National Committee."

But he and his surrogates have insisted it’s worth it — and might even pay for itself — by igniting supercharged economic growth. “The Trump economic plan creates at least 25 million jobs, boosts growth up to 4 percent, and is revenue neutral,” the campaign boasts on its website.

One problem: According to new analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the Trump plan wouldn’t increase growth. It would reduce it. Substantially. And it would do so precisely because it’s anything but revenue neutral.

TPC, using the economic projections of the Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) from the University of Pennsylvania, projects that the plan will help the economy in the short run by putting more money in people's pockets to spend. But by 2025, the impact of the plan becomes negative as an explosion in US government debt raises interest rates for businesses and consumers. After its first decade, the plan would reduce GDP by 0.5 percent. By 2036, two decades after enactment, it would cut GDP by 4 percent.

Concurrently, the center released economic analysis of the effect of Hillary Clinton’s plans to raise taxes on the rich. They find the reverse effect: economic damage in the short run, but salutary effects from deficit reduction in the medium to long run. However, the analysis omits the fact that Clinton would use those tax hikes not to offset the deficit but to fund new spending. When that’s taken into account, the effect is likely a wash or modestly negative.

The Clinton analysis, then, is not all that informative about the consequences of her policies. The Trump analysis, however, is a fair reflection of what Trump would actually do, and the conclusions are pretty damning.

Conventional economics says Trump’s deficits will slow growth

The PWBM is what's known in economics as an ""overlapping generations model,"" a common tool used to measure the long-run effects of policies that affect multiple generations of people. Like basically any economic model, it's imperfect. It relies on a lot of assumptions about how markets respond to changes in government policy, how much debt bondholders are willing to buy before demanding higher interest rates from the government, how investors react to lower tax rates on investment income, and the like.

But its conclusions, while subject to dispute, are nonetheless informative. TPC, in using the model, assumes that Trump is not able to finance the $6.2 trillion cost of the plan by cutting spending. That’s pretty fair; the cuts necessary to make that work would be genuinely massive to the point of utter implausibility. You could eliminate spending on foreign affairs, veterans, and income support for the poor and still not have enough to fund the tax cuts.

In the PWBM, as in most economic models, you can’t fund the government through borrowing indefinitely without interest rates rising. The logic is that after a while you’d run out of people willing to buy government debt at current interest rate levels, and to get buyers you’d need to jack up the rates. That means, in turn, that other people and firms that want people to lend them money have to jack up interest rates to get money that would otherwise go to the government. That means higher interest rates on mortgages, business loans, and the like. That slows down growth, as companies don’t borrow money to make investments they otherwise would have.

This effect creeps in slowly. Initially, both the PWBM and another model TPC uses show Trump’s tax cuts helping the economy by increasing people and companies’ after-tax incomes and thus boosting spending. PWBM, for instance, shows GDP jumping by 1 percent due to the plan in its first year. Pretty good, right? But then the effects of higher interest rates kick in. By 2024, GDP is right back to where it would've been pre-tax cut. By 2025, it's lower. By 2036, it's a full 4 percent, or $1.6 trillion, lower.

What about fiscal stimulus?

Over the past decade or so, deficit concerns have rightly taken a back seat to the task of economic recovery. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near or at zero, which many left-of-center politicians and economists have argued makes deficit-funded fiscal stimulus necessary. This isn't as costly as it is under normal circumstances, both due to low interest rates and because the stimulus boosts growth, which in turn raises tax collections and limits the actual cost of the stimulus.

The economy is still weak enough that many think we could still use a little fiscal stimulus. But there are signs that era is nearing its end. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2015 for the first time since the recession hit, and is talking about raising them again. The most recent Consumer Price Index data suggests that core inflation might be finally rising above 2 percent, the Fed's target. That suggests that now, or soon, it might be time for a return to conventional thinking on deficits, where they're viewed as, if not the worst thing in the world, at least a contributor to rising interest rates and a moderate drag on growth.

If you’re skeptical that things are really back to normal, then you should be skeptical of the projected harms of the Trump plan as well. TPC also ran a simulation using PWBM in which it assumed that capital markets were totally global and open. In that world, US deficit spending has basically no impact on interest rates, either for US debt or for business loans. It thus has little effect on economic growth either. In that world, GDP is left permanently higher by the Trump plan, even if it's never paid for.

Trump and his campaign can take solace in that scenario. But again, it’s not the middle-of-the-ground projection that TPC leads with. The projection in which they’re most confident is one that sees the Trump plan sharply reducing GDP over a 20-year time span. An even harsher set of assumptions shows the plan cutting GDP by nearly 13 percent by 2040.

TPC’s best guess, then, is that Trump’s plan, far from triggering a huge amount of economic growth as his campaign has promised, would hamper the economy, hobbling businesses with higher-than-necessary borrowing costs. The Trump plan, the analysis suggests, leaves America poorer, less equal, and much deeper in debt."

483,1. Presidential election reactions and expectations - Pew Research Center,1. Presidential election reactions and expectations  Pew Research Center,"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3Jlc2VhcmNoLm9yZy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDE2LzExLzIxL3ByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1lbGVjdGlvbi1yZWFjdGlvbnMtYW5kLWV4cGVjdGF0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Pew Research Center,"Half of voters say they are happy Donald Trump was elected president, while about as many (48%) say that they are unhappy. Reactions are similar to 2012 (when 52% said they were happy Obama was reelected), but they are less positive than after Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008, when 58% said they were happy he was elected.

Not surprisingly, 97% of Trump voters say they are happy he won, while 93% of Clinton voters say they are unhappy. While wide majorities of voters for the losing presidential candidate are always broadly dissatisfied with the election outcome, this phenomenon was less pronounced eight years ago; in 2008, 77% of McCain supporters said they were unhappy Obama won and 13% said they were happy.

One reaction to the election outcome that most Trump and Clinton supporters share is surprise. Overall, 73% of all voters say they are surprised that Trump won the election, including 87% of Clinton voters. A somewhat smaller 60%-majority of Trump voters express surprise at the outcome, though 40% say they are not surprised he won.

Emotional reactions to Trump’s election

Voters express a mix of emotional reactions to the election of Donald Trump. On the positive side, 51% say that Trump’s election makes them feel hopeful; somewhat fewer say it makes them feel proud (36%).

On the negative side, 53% say Trump’s election makes them feel uneasy. About four-in-ten say his election makes them feel sad (41%) or scared (41%), and 31% say the election of Trump makes them feel angry.

Eight years ago, voters’ emotional reactions to Obama’s election were somewhat more positive. In response to a slightly differently worded question that asked about how Obama made them feel – as opposed to how the election of Obama made them feel – fully 69% of voters said he made them feel hopeful, while just 35% said that he made them feel uneasy.

Nearly all Trump supporters (96%) say that his election makes them feel hopeful. A somewhat smaller – but still wide – majority of Trump supporters say that his election makes them feel proud (74%).

Among Clinton supporters, the most widespread reaction to Trump’s victory is unease: 90% say the election of Trump makes them feel uneasy. About three-quarters say his election makes them feel sad (77%) or scared (76%). While less widespread than other negative reactions, most Clinton supporters (62%) also say Trump’s election makes them feel angry.

Though majorities of Clinton supporters across demographic groups express unease, sadness, fear and anger about the election of Trump, Clinton voters with college degrees are more likely than those with less education to express anger and sadness. About seven-in-ten Clinton voters with a bachelor’s degree or higher (69%) say Trump’s election makes them feel angry; a narrower 56% majority of Clinton voters with less education say this. And while 70% of Clinton voters who have not graduated from college say Trump’s election makes them feel sad, fully 85% who have college degrees say that it does.

Will Trump have a successful first term?

On balance, voters are optimistic about Trump’s first term: 56% say it’s more likely that Trump will have a successful first term, while 39% say it’s more likely that he’ll have an unsuccessful first term. Overall views on this question are about the same as they were four years ago, after Barack Obama’s reelection, but are less positive than in 2008. Following Obama’s victory over John McCain eight years ago, 67% of voters expected Obama would have a successful first term.

An overwhelming 97% of Trump voters expect him to have a successful first term; this is comparable to the 92% of Obama voters who said this about their candidate in 2008.

Views of Trump’s first term among Clinton voters are broadly negative and they are more negative than expectations were for Obama’s first term among John McCain’s supporters in 2008. Overall, just 15% of Clinton supporters think Trump’s first term will be successful, while 76% think it will be unsuccessful. In 2008, nearly four-in-ten McCain supporters (39%) thought Obama would have a successful first term.

Can Clinton voters give Trump a chance?

While expectations for Trump’s administration among Clinton voters are low, 58% say they’re “willing to give Trump a chance and see how he governs.” But nearly four-in-ten Clinton voters (39%) say “I can’t see myself giving Trump a chance because of the kind of person he has shown himself to be.” Clinton supporters expressed highly negative evaluations of Trump throughout the campaign. For example, in October registered voters who supported Clinton said Trump lacked respect for a wide range of groups, including women, blacks, Hispanics, immigrants and Muslims.

Clinton voters under the ages of 18-49 are somewhat less likely to say they are willing to give Trump a chance (52%) than are Clinton supporters age 50 and older (64%). There are only modest differences across other demographic groups among Clinton supporters.

In the wake of Trump’s election, there is little sign of concern among his voters about the type of president he will be. Overall, 88% of Trump voters say they are confident about the kind of president he will be, while just 10% say they have serious concerns about the kind of president he will be.

Voters split on whether Trump will favor the needs of his supporters

After a heated general election campaign, voters are divided over whether they think Trump will put the needs of those who supported him in the election ahead of the needs of other Americans. Overall, 51% say that Trump will give equal priority to all Americans, including those who did not support him; 46% say Trump will give greater priority to the needs of those who supported him in the election.

However, these views largely divide along lines of support: Trump voters overwhelmingly say that he will give equal priority to the needs of all Americans (84%). By contrast, 75% of Clinton voters think he will give greater priority to the needs of his supporters.

Views of how Trump will change Washington

About half of voters (48%) say they think Trump will change the way things work in Washington for the better, 25% think he will change things for the worse and 25% do not think he will change things much either way.

Overwhelmingly, Trump voters expect their candidate to bring positive change to Washington: 89% think he will change the way things work for the better, while just 9% don’t think he’ll change things much either way and 1% say he’ll change things for the worse.

Clinton voters are split in their views: 48% think Trump will change the way things work in Washington for the worse, while 39% don’t expect him to change things much either way and just 9% think he will change Washington for the better.

Many voters not clear on Trump’s goals and vision for country

While most voters say that Trump will change Washington – either for the better or for the worse – many say they do not have a good idea of Trump’s vision for the country. As many voters say they have a good idea of where Trump wants to lead the country (49%) as say his goals are not very clear (49%).

By 87%-12%, Trump voters say they have a good idea of where Trump wants to lead the country. Opinion is the reverse among Clinton voters. Fully 84% of her supporters say Trump’s goals are not very clear, while just 14% say they have a good idea of where he wants to take the country.

Health care tops list of priorities voters suggest Trump tackle first

Voters offer a mix of ideas for what Trump’s first priority should be as president. In an open-ended question, 20% of voters suggest health care as Trump’s first priority – the most of any other issue area voters named. Roughly one-in-ten name the economy (12%), immigration (10%), unifying the country (8%) and jobs and unemployment (8%) as the top priority issues Trump should address as president.

Another 6% of voters think Trump’s first priority should be to change his personal behavior and address divisions stoked during his campaign.

Fewer mention environmental issues and climate change, as well as foreign policy, as Trump’s first priority as president (3% each).

Nearly three-in-ten (29%) Trump voters name health care as Trump’s first priority as president, compared with fewer Clinton voters (12%) who say the same (note that while most voters who mentioned health care did not mention what they’d like to see done, among those who did mention what they’d like to see done, Trump voters were more likely to mention repealing the Affordable Care Act, while Clinton voters were more likely to mention maintaining it, or fixing it). Trump voters also were slightly more likely than Clinton voters to name the economy (15% vs. 9%) and immigration (15% vs. 6%). Trump and Clinton voters were about equally likely to say that jobs (10% vs. 7%) should be the main priority of the president-elect.

Among Clinton voters, about a quarter (23%) offer as their top priority for Trump suggestions about healing divisions: 12% say that Trump should prioritize unifying the country, while 11% want to see him change his personal behavior and address divisions he created during his campaign.

Mixed views of confidence in Trump on major issues

When asked how much confidence they have in Trump to “do the right thing” dealing with five major issues, Trump performs best when it comes to dealing with the economy: 62% of voters have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in him in this area, including 36% who express a great deal of confidence in Trump, while 37% say they have little or no confidence in him. And 56% have at least a fair amount of confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding the threat of terrorism, while 44% say they have little or no confidence in him on this issue.

In three other areas: dealing with health care, illegal immigration and foreign policy, voters’ views are more divided, with roughly half of voters expressing little or no confidence in Trump on these issues and about half expressing at least a fair amount of confidence.

At least nine-in-ten Trump voters say they have at least a fair amount of confidence in him on each of these five issues. However, the share expressing a great deal of confidence in Trump varies by issue. Seven-in-ten of his voters have a great deal of confidence that he will do the right thing on the economy (70%), and nearly as many (64%) say this about the threat of terrorism. Yet fewer express a great deal of confidence that he will do the right thing when it comes to health care (58%) or illegal immigration (55%), and only about half (47%) of Trump voters express a great deal of confidence in him on foreign policy.

Conversely, most Clinton voters say they have not too much or no confidence at all that Trump will do the right thing on all of these issues. On four of five issues, over 80% of Clinton supporters say they have not too much or no confidence. Nearly two-thirds of Clinton supporters say they have no confidence at all in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to illegal immigration (64%) or foreign policy (63%). However, just 40% say they have no confidence in Trump when it comes to dealing with the economy.

Despite the vast gulf in confidence between Clinton and Trump voters, both sides tend to give Trump relatively better – or worse – ratings on the same issues. For example, both give Trump his best marks on the economy – where the largest share (27%) of Clinton supporters say they have at least a fair amount of confidence and 99% of Trump supporters say the same. Similarly, confidence in Trump is weaker on foreign policy among both his supporters and Clinton’s.

Few voters expect Trump’s election to lead to improved race relations

Voters are skeptical that Trump’s election as president will lead to better race relations in the United States: Just a quarter (25%) think this is the case. By contrast, 46% of voters say race relations will get worse after Trump’s election, and 26% say his election will make no difference. Voters were much more optimistic that Obama would have a positive impact on race relations in the days following his 2008 election: 52% said his election would lead to improving race relations, while just 9% said they would worsen (36% expected little change).

There are stark differences by vote choice in opinion on progress for race relations after Trump’s election. Half of Trump voters (50%) expect race relations to get better, and 38% think his election will make no difference; just 9% think race relations will get worse.

On the other hand, an overwhelming majority of Clinton voters (84%) think Trump’s election will lead to worse race relations in the country. Few Clinton voters think his election will make no difference (13%) or lead to better race relations (2%). In 2008, Obama voters were more optimistic than McCain’s that race relations would improve (69% vs. 34%); still, just 17% of McCain’s voters expected relations would worsen (a 45% plurality said Obama’s election would not make a difference)."

During the campaign, Donald Trump characterized himself as a champion of working-class voters who felt left behind and disconnected from more prosperous parts of the country. And Trump's historic upset victory last week was fueled by working-class voters in the Rust Belt and elsewhere who believed in this promise.

Many of the counties that flipped from voting for Barack Obama in 2012 to Donald Trump in 2016 were in the Rust Belt swing states of Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan. In his victory speech he reached out to those voters again, saying, ""The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.""

The Trump transition team is reaching out to economists to serve as policy advisers. NPR did a little fishing, and found one of them. We called up labor economist Richard Burkhauser of Cornell, who signed a petition against Hillary Clinton's economic plan during the campaign. He tells NPR that Trump's team just reached out to him and asked him ""if I was interested in applying for a job."" So will he take a job with the new administration? ""It's a very exciting possibility,"" Burkhauser says.

Burkhauser is a free market economist who tends to vote Republican. He says with Republicans controlling the White House, Congress and the Senate, after years of frustrating gridlock, he thinks the new administration could actually get important things done to boost economic growth. ""I think it would be extraordinarily exciting to be part of an administration that uses Republican ideas to do something for workers in the middle who have not enjoyed the benefits of economic growth for the last 20 or 30 years,"" he says.

But could you do that just with Republican ideas? ""I don't think so,"" says David Autor, an economist at MIT who is known for his influential work on international trade with the U.S. and China — both its benefits and its devastating impact on some Americans.

Autor says Trump won with a fiery, populist, kick-the-bums-out-of-Washington campaign that promised to help working- and middle-class voters. But Autor says, ""I think the Republican Party has done extremely little for them.""

Autor says he is not registered with any political party. But he says if Trump really wants to help people left behind, this task is not easy. He says President Obama was working on it, too, and made some progress. And Autor says Trump needs to reach out beyond traditional Republican economists, because they mostly focus on cutting taxes and regulation.

""Yes, the irony is that if the Trump administration were looking for expertise in policy to improve the living conditions and working conditions of less affluent Americans, they would look to a lot of Democratic and left-of-center scholars who have devoted their political and academic careers to trying to improve exactly on those fronts,"" Autor says.

He says it might be a moonshot, but if Trump can draw from the best ideas on the left and the right, then we might see a really effective mix of policies: tax credits for the working class that conservatives support; and help with education and health care costs, which are traditionally liberal ideas.

In his victory speech, Trump appeared to be casting a wide net for advisers.

""For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people,"" Trump said to some chuckles, ""I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.""

And he added, ""We will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all.""

Still, nobody from the Trump campaign has called Autor. And even if they did, he says he is among many economists who would have a hard time forgetting Trump's campaign, which he saw as marked by race-baiting, misogyny and xenophobia.

""I think many of us who would be happy to support a sensible policy mission would still be extremely hesitant to be a part of that team knowing the moral depths it doesn't hesitate to sink to,"" Autor says.

Meanwhile, as Trump builds his team, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be watching. She fired a letter at Trump this week criticizing his transition team picks so far as too tied to Wall Street and big business.

Warren wrote that those picks and the people rumored to be in the running for Cabinet positions are ""a slew of Wall Street bankers, industry insiders, and special interest lobbyists."" She says these ties to Wall Street and big business show Trump putting the interests of the rich and powerful above those of the working-class families. Trump, she says, ""already appear[s] to be failing"" on his promise to help working families rather than the rich and powerful. And if he doesn't change course, she warns:

""Let me be clear. Should you refuse, I will oppose you, every step of the way, for the next four years. I will champion the millions of Americans you will fail to protect. I will track your every move, and I will remind Americans, every day, of the actions you take that fail them. And I will not be the only one watching. The millions of Americans who voted for you — and the millions who didn't — will all be watching you.""

At the same time, Warren offered to help Trump find qualified advisers."

Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump doubled down on a larger theme of his presidential campaign in a speech Wednesday, arguing that the American economy, once an engine of prosperity, is in precipitous decline.

“The real wages for our workers have not been raised for eighteen years,” he said, repeating a familiar lament about job destruction, open borders, and stagnating incomes.

Trump’s strategy is essentially the same as Mitt Romney’s in 2012. The idea is to appeal to struggling voters’ feelings of economic malaise—and then to ask them, implicitly or otherwise, to make the decision: Are you better off today, under a Democratic administration’s leadership, that you would be with a Republican at the helm?

To millions of Americans, particularly the white, working-class voters who make up Trump’s base, it’s an effective appeal. Many voters have indeed watched their economic prospects wither in the past two decades, as the forces of globalization, automation and outsourcing have destroyed and dismantled traditional jobs. In the twenty-seven years since 1989, real median household income in the U.S. has increased a piddling 0.7%. Between 2006 and 2014, it has declined nearly 7%.

But there’s a problem with Trump’s argument. If you control for demographic changes—Baby Boomers retiring, an influx of young Millennial workers, etc.—the macroeconomy is not only improving, but real wages have been increasing for years.

According to a new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, real wage growth has averaged about 2.4% in the past two years. In 2015 alone, full-time workers saw wages increase 3.5% above inflation—nearly double the rate of wage increases in 2010. Average wage increases have also ticked up regularly, month by month, since January 2010, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

All this puts Trump’s rival, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, in a better position. Since launching her campaign last spring, Clinton has run on the promise that she would protect and expand President Obama’s economic policy platform. It makes her sales job easier that those policies not only appear to be working, but that many Americans are feeling it.

According to a new Federal Reserve’s report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2015, nearly 70 percent of Americans now say they’re “doing okay” or “living comfortably.” Just 18.5 percent say they’re “worse off.” Those numbers, while not quite stellar, mark a major improvement from 2013, when the same study, asking the same questions, found that nearly 40% of Americans reported that they were struggling economically.

Read next: How The Election Will Really Affect Your Investments

One reason for the disconnect between Trump’s gloomy statistics about declining wages and Americans’ slightly sunnier outlook is a muddiness in the way we measure economic prosperity. If you look at real—i.e. inflation-adjusted—median income of American households, Trump’s assessment of American workers’ stagnating wages appears right on. But that’s not comparing apples to apples.

As fertility rates have fallen and as it’s become more common to live alone, American households have shrunk by roughly 3.4% since the late ‘90s. So comparing a household of two people to a household of four doesn’t necessarily give you a meaningful window into relative prosperity. After all, a four-person household earning the equivalent of $60,000 in 1989 is not necessarily better off than a two-person household earning $45,000 in 2016. Yet if you compare the two as static data points, it would appear as if household incomes are declining.

Comparing real household income also doesn’t take in account other quirks of American demographics, such as the aging population of Baby Boomers. Members of that generation have long enjoyed the highest salaries, so when the oldest among them began retiring in 2008—and swapped those pretty paychecks for pensions—they artificially skewed income downward. The same thing happened when the large Millennial generation, those born in the early 1980s, entered the job market for the first time. As nearly all young people do, they secured relatively low, entry-level salaries, which had the effect of skewing averaging income down. In other words, according to the San Francisco Federal Reserve report, median household income is declining—but that’s not a fair measure of Americans’ relative prosperity.

A better measure would be to look at real incomes of Americans on an individual basis. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, most individual Americans’ real income grew 1.9% from February to December 2013. In 2014, they grew another 3% and last year, they jumped another 4%. The average American today makes 13% more than in 1989, and that number has been climbing steadily since the end of the Great Recession.

The Millennial generation, born between the early ‘80s and the mid-1990s, has done even better. According to a June analysis by the economist Robert Shapiro, between 2009 and 2012, young people saw their incomes tick up 3.2%. Between 2013 and 2014, they rose another 4.3%. Members of Generation X, who saw their incomes drop in the recession, have seen average 2.3% increases between 2013 and 2014. The youngest among the Baby Boomer set—the youngest who have not yet retired—saw the biggest hit during the recession, losing more than 1% of income on average, but have since rebounded by a half a percent.

That’s not to say that today’s economy is all sunshine and unicorns. GDP growth is sluggish, productivity is falling, the markets are skittish, and while Americans have seen their wages increase, they’ve seen their expenses balloon, too. The cost of child care is now almost double what it was in 1986, the cost of health care is increasing by roughly 5% per year, and people are getting into ever more debt.

Which is perhaps one reason that Clinton’s stump speech still sounds a cautionary note. In the same breath that she commits herself to expanding Obama’s successful economic policies, she often adds that they have not done enough—that there’s more work to be done. “I respect the fear, the anxiety, even the anger that a lot of people are feeling because the advance of globalization and technology has really replaced or undermined the future for many jobs,” Clinton told the Washington Post in an interview this week. She added that many Americans “are looking for somebody who will explain, in a way they will accept, what’s happened.”

In this election, both presumptive candidates’ explanations—and their solutions—are markedly different. Clinton generally offers a wonky account of the shifting global economy and the changing nature of jobs in the future, and suggests an equally wonky set of incremental policy provisions.

Trump is less delicate. He blames “bad trade deals,” stupid people in government and immigration, and then serves up a solution notably hard to pin down with numbers and graphs. “We are going to make America rich again. We are going to make America safe again,” he said, concluding his speech Wednesday. “We are going to make America great again, great again for everyone.”

The election won’t be decided by these reports, but rather by which of those two visions of the economy feels most right to voters."

Though Fields said Ford has “had conversations with the transition team” for the incoming president, his comments, made during a keynote speech marking the opening of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, could escalate a sometimes sharp dispute that began early during the election campaign. It was touched off by Ford’s announcement it would shift small car production from U.S. plants to a new factory in Mexico.

“We’ve got to keep (factories) here. It’s not that hard to do,” then-candidate Trump said during one campaign interview, adding that if Ford and other makers continued to expand in Mexico, “pretty soon all we’re going to have is nursing home jobs.”

Earlier this year, Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. met with Trump to discuss what the grandson of company founder Henry Ford describe as “infuriating” attacks. Ford executives stressed that they were replacing production of slow-selling small cars like the Focus with high-demand light truck models such as the F-150 pickup.

That failed to quell the dispute, the idea of tearing up trade deals such as NAFTA and a yet-unapproved trans-Pacific pact becoming a centerpiece of the Trump campaign. There have been some signs that the New York businessman might pull back from such tariffs, though with the transition process reportedly in turmoil it has become difficult to tell precisely where the next administration will position itself once in office.

'Free Trade is a Must'

Fields used his keynote speech to send a message that aggressive anti-trade moves would be risky, telling reporters and industry officials gathered in downtown Los Angeles that, “A tariff like that (Trump has proposed) could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy.”

Fields tried to soften the tone of his comments, adding that there have been meetings with the transition team, and that, “we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress.”

But free trade is a must for Ford, he added, Fields indicating that the second-largest U.S. automaker doesn’t intend to back down from plans that it has, in the past, said are necessary to delivering an acceptable return on investment.

In fact, just hours before Fields delivered his morning keynote, Ford announced another move that could lead to further friction with Washington. The carmaker says it will begin selling a new entry-level SUV in the U.S. in 2018, with the little EcoSport coming off an assembly line in India.

That would mark the first time a major manufacturer has imported an Indian-made automobile, but others may follow — along with one of that country’s biggest local producers, Mahinda & Mahindra.

Meanwhile, two automakers have begun importing vehicles from China, Volvo moving first with a stretched version of its S60 sedan dubbed Inscription. General Motors followed recently with the launch of the Chinese-made Buick Envision utility vehicle.

Mexico in the Headlights

But Mexico, in particular, has been in the crosshairs for Donald Trump. The country has experienced explosive growth in its carmaking sector in recent years, becoming one of the five largest automotive manufacturing nations in the world.

Just this week, Toyota broke ground for a new assembly plant in the state of Guanajuato that will produce the world’s best-selling vehicle, the Corolla. New plants run by Kia, Audi and Nissan’s Infiniti brand went into production in recent months.

Industry planners say that low wages are only a part of the appeal. They also point to the need to balance operations around the world, sometimes shifting production bases to both keep plants operating efficiently and holding down costs.

“The automotive business is truly global. So, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders,” said Joe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting. “It’s how you keep the costs down.”

Other automotive insiders have begun weighing in, though cautiously, many worried about going on the record and getting off on a bad foot with the new administration.

""I am sure free and fair trade is a better way for all of us,” said Ralf Speth, CEO of British-based Jaguar Land Rover. Though the German-born executive insisted he was not criticizing Trump, or any specific U.S. trade plans, he stressed his belief that trade barriers ""only make things more difficult and, at the end of the day, this takes buying power away from the people."""

“I just came to celebrate his new job,” Son said. “I said, ‘This is great, the U.S. will become great again’.”

Son is the founder and chief executive of SoftBank, one of Japan’s largest technology outfits, which owns the U.S. mobile carrier Sprint. Sprint shares initially spiked after the announcement. Son left Trump Tower after being escorted down the elevator by the president-elect, who touted the pledge before waiting investors.

The announcement is the latest instance in which Trump appears to be conducting economic policy via ad-hoc deal-making — and sometimes taking credit whether he deserves it or not. Last week, the president-elect spoke at the Carrier furnace plant in Indianapolis after the company announced plans to keep 800 jobs at the plant instead of outsourcing them to Mexico. Trump quickly claimed he had saved those positions, even though the company is still shifting more than 1,000 jobs from that factory and another Indiana plant to Mexico.

Similarly, the week after the election Trump tweeted that he had dissuaded Ford Motor Co. from moving a Kentucky factory to Mexico. The claim was a stretch; Ford had no plans to move the plant and had already agreed to keep producing one specific model there, although it did back away from a plan to shift production of the Lincoln MKC, a small SUV, from Louisville to Cuautitlan, Mexico.

Trump quickly took credit for Son’s commitment on Tuesday, writing on Twitter: “Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!”

Financial details about the commitment and its timeframe remain unclear. Questions sent to Softbank, Foxconn and T-Mobile were not answered. Sprint spokesman Dave Tovar referred questions to Softbank.

Sprint has struggled since Softbank bought it. The carrier’s attempt to join with rival T-Mobile failed in 2014 after regulators objected to combining two of the four largest mobile telecom companies in the United States. T-Mobile has surpassed Sprint to become the No. 3 carrier, while Sprint has struggled with cost cuts and layoffs. (AT&T and Verizon are the largest wireless carriers.)

In October, SoftBank announced that it would establish a $25 billion fund for technology investments that could grow to $100 billion. SoftBank said it signed an agreement with a fund run by the government of Saudi Arabia and other investors.

In addition to Sprint, SoftBank owns Britain’s ARM Holdings. ARM is known as an innovator in the “internet of things,” and in technology used in smartphones. It also sells the Pepper human-shaped companion robot for homes and businesses, and runs a solar energy business in Japan. The company, founded in 1981, also has within its investment empire financial technology and ride-booking services."

Now, because he has both no sense of irony and a slightly inflated sense of ego, Donald Trump has decided any positive economic news of late is his doing and wants to be thanked accordingly.

Except, as The Washington Post points out, the market surge is not historically anomalous:

Trump's right that the index is up nearly 10 percent since Election Day. We looked at this surge earlier this month, putting it into historical context. It matches the post-election surges enjoyed by Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover (the president whose tenure overlapped with the Great Depression, meaning he, too, failed to hit Trump's arbitrary 3-percent-growth metric).

Oh, and the holiday spending?

The number he cites—a trillion dollars—appears to come from a Deloitte survey that projected holiday sales from November through January and reached that trillion-dollar number. Mind you, that survey was released in October, meaning that the projections had nothing to do with a Trump electoral win. Deloitte instead credited better household finances and the steadily improving economy for the figure. In fact, Deloitte's numbers specifically indicate that three-quarters of Americans didn't expect the presidential election to affect their spending at all.

As for the spike in economic confidence, Trump himself should probably be thanking Republicans, who, post-election, believe things are suddenly, mysteriously improved.

“Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U.S. economy’s outlook than they did before the election,” Gallup's Justin McCarthy and Jeffrey M. Jones wrote. “Just 16 percent of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81 percent said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49 percent say it is getting better and 44 percent worse.”

Regardless of whether or not Trump is actually due any credit, we should probably all just get used to thanking him for things he had no role in making happen, as he will demand for the next four years. Your favorite celebrity doesn’t die in 2017? Thanks, Donald! Your latest selfie scores a ton of likes on Instagram? You notice the unemployment rate is actually 4.9 percent and not as high as 42 percent, as Trump claimed just two months ago? It’s pretty obvious to whom you should offer some gratitude."

On speaking out

PAUL SOLMAN: You’re passionately anti-Donald Trump.

REID HOFFMAN: I am.

PAUL SOLMAN: You say that lots of your fellow business people are too, but they won’t say so publicly.

REID HOFFMAN: Yes. There are two reasons, one is well-intentioned, which is the classic kind of American notion. We want to be inclusive, we want to have our shareholders, our employees, our customers, whether they are Democrat, Republican, Green or Libertarian, to feel comfortable with how we’re doing business. And so that tends to be apolitical. People say, “No, no, I just simply shouldn’t get involved in politics.”

PAUL SOLMAN: Not because it isn’t necessarily good for me or my company; it’s just not good for the country for companies to be partisan.

REID HOFFMAN: Yes. And actually, I don’t even agree with this stance, but I understand it. It has a good intention. The other reason why people don’t take a stand, which is very true in this election, is looking at Trump and fearing reprisal, fearing reprisal from someone who is seeking the highest, most powerful role in the land, who has had a history of doing everything from attacks, threats and lawsuits and who has a complete kind of vengeful, narcissistic behavior, which makes people legitimately worried, almost like a schoolyard bully, that if I step up, am I going to be targeted, too?

READ MORE: For Trump, China is at the heart of U.S. economic problems

PAUL SOLMAN: Isn’t it a reasonable fear? If you’re running a company, you’re beholden not just to your shareholders necessarily, but your stakeholders, your employees and so forth, and so for a very good reason you might not jeopardize them by antagonizing the guy who could be the president of the United States.

REID HOFFMAN: It is, of course, a completely reasonable fear, but one of the things is when you think, “Wait, I’m fearful of retaliation, I’m fearful of oppression because of someone who is going into a public office, who might be vengeful for their own personal reasons, that’s actually not a reason to hide — that’s a reason to step up, right?”

This is part of what we learned from the 1920s. How do you step up to anything from a bully to a would be dictator and say, “No, no, we actually value a free society, we value a society in which people have intelligent discourse and views and can actually articulate them and say them truthfully and openly.”

On Hillary Clinton

REID HOFFMAN: I think Hillary hears the anger in a broad swath of the American people, and she says, “OK, how do I help create a future that’s good for you?”

PAUL SOLMAN: But she’s no revolutionary; she’s part of the establishment and has been, as Mr. Trump points out, for 30 years.

REID HOFFMAN: She is part of the establishment, and that’s good for foreign policy and for understanding the ongoing health care system. There’s a bunch of good in that, and that good should not be discounted. She’s also smart, she talks to people, she hears, and she says, “OK, I need to update, we need some much bigger changes.” And you can see her talking about how do we help small businesses? We understand that most of the middle class doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t feel like they have economic progress, and she goes, “OK, I realize that’s my top agenda item. That’s the thing I need to do.”

I don’t think you need to blow up the whole thing in order to accomplish that. There’s a lot of people in the world that would love to trade places with American citizens, and we are very fortunate to be here.

READ MORE: Is economic anxiety fueling Trump and Sanders supporters?

PAUL SOLMAN: So Hillary Clinton has suddenly woken up to the plight of the middle class? Have you suddenly woken up to it?

REID HOFFMAN: So I think Hillary has and is working toward it in a democratic process.

We’ve been working for years on how we can use technology to help people make their own jobs, become entrepreneurs, create their own small businesses. Those are the kinds of things that I and a bunch of other people at LinkedIn actually work on. Now, that being said, I think we realized the depth of frustration through the current political process. So we said, “OK, we know there’s a serious problem here, we know we need to work on it,” and now it’s “Oh, we need to work on it a lot faster.”

PAUL SOLMAN: Did you know how angry people were?

REID HOFFMAN: No. I think I knew how frightened people were, and I think I knew that people were worried about their future. I don’t think I realized that they would be willing to risk kind of a 1920s Germany in order to blow it all up, not realizing that we’ve accomplished a lot as Americans, and we want to keep the good things and revolutionize the new things.

On politics in Silicon Valley

PAUL SOLMAN: Aren’t there a lot of people here in Silicon Valley who don’t believe in democracy at all anymore at this point?

REID HOFFMAN: Democracy tends to be a collaborative process, a committee, a consensus. Silicon Valley tends to believe in the individual who creates a small group and does something big. Democracy is always frustrating. I think most of them are not very well educated themselves to understand the Winston Churchill line — democracy is the worst of all governments until you consider all the other ones.

PAUL SOLMAN: But if you have a really strong, effective leader, that can make a huge difference to a country. Think of Singapore for example.

READ MORE: What’s Clinton’s position on trade? She’s ‘standing with us,’ says Sherrod Brown

REID HOFFMAN: So benevolent, enlightened, wise dictators are the most efficient form of government. The problem is what comes afterwards, right? Part of the reason we like democracy is it’s the portfolio of decades, which is to say you don’t also get the disastrous dictator who completely destroys a society, engages you in wars and so forth. And so I’m sympathetic to the people who go, “Whoa, we’d like to have the benevolent, wise dictator. It will all work much more efficiently,” but the reason that we remain staunch democrats — with a small d — is it’s a decades long, it’s a centuries long, it’s a country long process for being inclusive.

PAUL SOLMAN: You must be trying to convince your fellow business people to come out as you have and take the risks you’re taking. Any success?

REID HOFFMAN: I am. I think we’ll see more of it. I think Steve Case published a great column in the Washington Post recently. I think the right way to do this is just to step up and do it, so I actually think we’ll see more of that over the next coming weeks, because I think they’ll say, “We’d like to be good for business and quiet on politics, but this is too urgent, it is too much of a key crisis in who we are going to become as Americans. We can risk too much, and so we have to step forward.” And I think you will see more and more people stepping forward, like Howard Schultz, Steve Case and other folks, in order to try to make a difference in this election."

Photograph by Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg via Getty

If things go as expected on Thursday, British voters will reject the option of leaving the European Union. Likewise, if things go as expected come November, American voters will reject the option of electing a President Trump. Both outcomes would be reassuring, but they wouldn't mean the end of right-wing populism on either side of the Atlantic—they may merely represent new high-water marks.

When the Brexit referendum is done, tens of millions of Britons will likely have registered a vote against the liberal vision of European unity and assimilation. In this country, even after the disastrous past few weeks Donald Trump has had, a new opinion poll, from Quinnipiac University, indicates that in crucial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania he remains statistically tied with Hillary Clinton.

Why is this happening? Trump and his counterpart in Britain, the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage, didn't emerge from nowhere. Both are wealthy men who affect an affinity with the common people, and who have skillfully exploited a deep well of resentment among working-class and middle-class voters, some of whom have traditionally supported left-of-center parties. Certainly, a parallel factor in both men’s rise is racism, or, more specifically, nativism. Trump has presented a nightmarish vision of America overrun by Mexican felons and Muslim terrorists. UKIP printed up campaign posters that showed thousands of dark-colored refugees lining up to enter Slovenia, which is part of the E.U., next to the words ""BREAKING POINT: The EU has failed us all."" But racism and nationalism have both been around for a long time, as have demagogues who try to exploit them. In healthy democracies, these troublemakers are confined to the fringes.

Historically, transforming radical parties of the right (or left) into mass movements has required some sort of disaster, such as a major war or an economic depression. Europe in the early twentieth century witnessed both, with cataclysmic results. After the First World War, the introduction of social democracy, the socioeconomic system that most Western countries settled on, delivered steadily rising living standards, which helped to keep the extremists at bay. If prosperity wasn't shared equally—and it wasn't—egalitarian social norms and redistributive tax systems blunted some of the inequities that go along with free-market capitalism.

But in the past few decades Western countries have been subjected to a triad of forces that, while not as visible or dramatic as wars and depressions, have proved equally destabilizing: globalization, technical progress, and a political philosophy that embraces both. In the United States, it is no coincidence that Trump is doing well in the Rust Belt and other deindustrialized areas. A one-two punch of automation and offshoring has battered these regions, leaving many of their residents ill-equipped to prosper in today's economy. Trump is exploiting the same economic anxieties and resentments that helped Bernie Sanders, another critic of globalization and free trade, carry the Michigan Democratic primary.

""There is no excuse for supporting a racist, sexist, xenophobic buffoon like Donald Trump,"" Dean Baker, an economist and blogger at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, in Washington, noted recently. ""But we should be clear; the workers who turn to him do have real grievances. The system has been rigged against them.""

Similarly, it is not an accident that UKIP is popular in the former mill towns of northern England, in the engineering belt of the West Midlands, and in working-class exurbs of London. ""Children emerging from the primary school next door, almost all from ethnic minorities, are just a visible reminder for anyone seeking easy answers to genuine grievance,"" the Guardian's Polly Toynbee wrote, last week, after a visit to Barking, in Essex, which is close to a big car factory owned by Ford. ""As high-status Ford jobs are swapped for low-paid warehouse work, indignation is diverted daily against migrants by the Mail, Sun, Sunday Times and the rest. . . . This is the sound of Britain breaking.""

For the past half century, the major political parties, on both sides of the Atlantic, have promulgated the idea that free trade and globalization are the keys to prosperity. If you pressed the mainstream economists who advise these parties, they might concede that trade creates losers as well as winners, and that the argument for ever more global integration implicitly assumes that the winners will compensate the losers. But the fact that such a sharing of the gains has been sorely lacking was regarded as a relatively minor detail, and certainly not as a justification for calling a halt to the entire process.

If you are reading this post, the likelihood is that you, like me, are one of the winners. Highly educated, professional people tend to work in sectors of the economy that have benefitted from the changes in the international division of labor (e.g., finance, consulting, media, tech) or have been largely spared the rigors of global competition (e.g., law, medicine, academia). From a secure perch on the economic ladder, it is easy to celebrate the gains that technology and globalization have brought, such as a cornucopia of cheap goods in rich countries and rising prosperity in poor ones. It's also tempting to dismiss the arguments of people who ignore the benefits of this process, or who can't see that it is irreversible.

But, as Baker points out, ""it is a bit hypocritical of those who have benefited"" from this economic transformation to be “mocking the poor judgment of its victims”—especially now that the forces of global competition and technological progress are reaching into areas that were previously protected. In a world of self-driving cars and trucks, what is the future for truck drivers, cab and limo drivers, and delivery men? Not a very prosperous one, surely. And the creative destruction that the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter celebrated won't stop there. With software that can transfer money at zero cost, medical robots that can carry out the most delicate of operations, and smart algorithms that can diagnose diseases or dispense legal advice, what is the future for bankers, surgeons, doctors, lawyers, and other professionals?

There is no straightforward answer to this question, just as there is no easy answer to the question of what can be done to help those who have already lost out. One option is to strengthen the social safety net and, perhaps, to move toward some sort of universal basic income, which would guarantee a minimum standard of living to everybody, regardless of employment prospects. The political enactment of such solutions, however, is contingent on the existence of social solidarity, which the very process of economic and technological change, by heightening inequalities and eroding communal institutions, undermines.

Lacking grounds for optimism, and feeling remote from the levers of power, the disappointed nurse their grievances—until along come politicians who tell them that they are right to be angry, that their resentments are justified, and that they should be mad not just at the winners but at immigrants, too. Trump and Farage are the latest and most successful of these political opportunists. Sadly, they are unlikely to be the last."

The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement.

What should we make of such campaign promises? If we take Mr. Trump at his word, he will seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. A delightful irony here is that the reason why it came into force so quickly (less than one year after being negotiated in Paris, whereas it took five years for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to come into effect) is that countries around the world rapidly ratified it to achieve the required threshold, precisely to prevent a possible Trump administration from immediately withdrawing. The United States is now part of the agreement for a minimum of four years.

READ MORE: Column: The most important issue this election forgot

In theory, the new administration could try to bypass the four-year delay involved in dropping out of the Paris climate agreement by taking the one-year route of dropping out of the overall United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — signed by President George H.W. Bush and ratified by the Senate in 1992. But that would likely require a two-thirds vote of the Senate (the Democrats would filibuster, in any event), would be challenged in the courts and would be unwise in the extreme.

On the other hand, the incoming Trump administration can simply disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That would be bad enough, but the greater concern is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share.

Undoing existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court.

In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency will probably stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed.

On the campaign trail in North Dakota, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That will not be easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. In Pittsburgh, Mr. Trump pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. The inconsistency of these claims — indeed, the internal contradiction — is striking.

READ MORE: What we know — and what we don’t — about global warming

This overall assessment is not optimistic, to put it mildly, so let me close with some good news. First, there are a number of federal “climate change policies” that have been bipartisan and are therefore much less likely to be repealed, such as the latest Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which regulate motor vehicle fuel efficiency, appliance efficiency standards as well the recently extended wind and solar tax credits.

Second, there should be little worry at this point about the new president and the new Congress weakening environmental laws, since such attempts would almost certainly be met with a filibuster from Senate Democrats, and the Republicans with their slim 51-48 majority (with one outstanding runoff election) are a substantial distance from a filibuster-proof total of 60 votes.

The reality is that if he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy.

Third and finally, there are a myriad of subnational climate change policies, ranging from AB-32 in California to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast. It is not a coincidence that there is a high — although not perfect — correlation between these states and those Hillary Clinton won in the election.

Despite this moderately “good news,” the reality is that if he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to the planet and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this realm."

Data ranging from wage and job growth to manufacturing-sector indicators show that Donald Trump is getting an economy in better shape than any new president in a generation. Take a look at the following four indicators to see just how fortunate the President-elect is:

GDP Growth

The only indicator that shows Trump inheriting a generally weaker economy than is typical is GDP growth. As you can see from the following chart, while Trump will assume management of a much stronger economy than Obama did eight years ago, GDP growth over the past year has been historically weak.

This fact is mitigated somewhat by a more slowly growing population, which leads to slower overall growth than a quickly growing population does. (Although even per capita measures of real GDP growth show the U.S. becoming richer at a slower pace.) And the fact that growth has been picking up recently. The economy grew at a 3.2% pace in the third quarter.

Wage Growth

Despite the good economy, voter surveys show that a good portion of Americans were unhappy with the economy. And that’s why GDP matters. It’s much more common for the typical American’s material situation to improve in an economy when overall GDP is growing quickly. So slow GDP growth has equally little or no raises. And that’s resulted in unhappy workers.

But that’s changing too. Recently there’s evidence that growth in wages in outpacing growth of the overall economy.

In 2015, the Census Bureau reported that the typical American saw the largest one-year increase in household income since it began surveying citizens on this question back in 1968. Other measures of wage growth, like the Employment Compensation Index and the average hourly earnings metric released by the Labor Department also show the average pace of wage gains increasing of late.

Given that takehome pay is the way most Americans interact directly with the economy, the trends in these statistics bode well for worker attitudes toward the Trump Administration.

Jobs

Economists point to the declining employment rate and the steady creation of new jobs as the drivers of wage growth. Indeed, the U.S. economy has been adding new jobs at a healthy pace, with job growth over the past year posting the highest monthly average in an election year since George H.W. Bush won in 1988:

Manufacturing, Housing, and Other Leading Indicators

The difficulty in projecting how economic trends will affect an incoming presidential administration is due to the tendency of recessions to unexpectedly materialize. The economy was booming, for instance, when George W. Bush took office in the winter of 2001. Growth had averaged more than 3.5% in the previous 3 quarters. But by March, the economy was in contraction, and stock markets began to falter following the Sept. 11 attacks later than year. The malaise of the dot-com crash set in in 2002, even as economic growth began again.

Although recessions are notoriously difficult to predict, there were warning signs at the turn of the millennium. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia produces a leading index which predicts the current 6-month growth rate for the U.S. economy. As you can see from the chart below, this index correctly predicted the past three downturns. This year: It is predicting modest growth between 1% and 2% this year. Nowhere near flashing the sort of recession signals that greeted President George W. Bush or Barack Obama.

That doesn’t mean that President Trump shouldn’t tread carefully. His more experimental policies, like his tough talk on trade and the institution of tariffs, have the potential to trigger a recession on their own. But the above data show that Trump is one of the luckier President-elects in recent memory, when judged by the economic conditions he is inheriting."

Before Donald Trump takes the oath of office in January, there are a lot of questions about how he will decide key policy issues.

We've identified the top 10 issues voters care about most according to a 2016 survey from the Pew Research Center and charted what Trump has said about each of them. The issues are, in order: the economy, terrorism, foreign policy, health care, gun policy, immigration, Social Security, education, Supreme Court appointments and the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities.

Where we could, we gave Trump's stances a simple ""Yes"" or ""No,"" but also used the rating ""It's Complicated"" in cases where his stance is more nuanced or has changed.

(Trump has given clues on what he'll prioritize in his first 100 days, which we've posted here and fact checked here.)

The Economy

Trump hopes to grow the economy by significantly lowering taxes. Under his plan, he says a middle-class family with two children would get a 35 percent income tax cut. He will also reduce the number of tax brackets from seven down to three, which would largely benefit the wealthiest Americans. When it comes to business tax rates, Trump wants to go from a 35 percent rate to 15 percent.

Trump is also big on infrastructure as a way to create jobs. He says he would grant the permit needed for the Keystone Pipeline despite opposition from environmental activists, as NPR's Scott Horsley outlined. He also plans to cancel all payments to U.N. climate change programs and put that money toward ""water and environmental infrastructure,"" as he wrote in his 100-day action plan. Trump would also lift restrictions on the oil, coal, shale and natural gas industries. In addition, he plans to impose tariffs to discourage companies from relocating to other countries.

Relevant stories

Terrorism

Trump made fighting terrorism a central pillar of his campaign and strengthened his hard-line stances with each high-profile terror attack, from the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last December to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., in June.

In his 100-day action plan, Trump promised to ""suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting."" During his campaign, he also condoned other extreme counter-terrorism tactics, like waterboarding.

Relevant stories

Foreign Policy

When it comes to foreign policy, Trump's main focus has been to upend U.S. trade policy. He has promised to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA, the United States' free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. According to NPR's Marilyn Geewax, actually doing away with NAFTA might not actually be feasible, but Trump could undermine it. He also wants to label China a currency manipulator and, per his 100-day plan, ""identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.""

Relevant stories

Health

Trump's main goal for health care policy is to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That feat will be harder than Trump seems to think, as we reported. To completely repeal and replace the act, he would need 60 votes in the Senate, which is the number needed to overcome a filibuster. Though they'll make up a majority, there will be only 51 Republican senators come January. He recently signaled in an interview that he may be open to keeping provisions of Obamacare that expand insurance to people with pre-existing conditions and to young people.

Trump has also promised to allow tax deductions for child care and elder care and to create tax-free dependent care savings accounts, with matching contributions for low-income families. As we reported earlier this year, that would cost the government $25 billion annually.

Relevant stories

Gun Policy

Donald Trump aligned himself strongly with the National Rifle Association, which endorsed him, and also with Second Amendment protectionists (though no major candidate claimed to want to take away gun rights outright). Trump has said states should be more diligent about putting criminal and mental health records into existing background check systems.

Relevant stories

Immigration

Restricting immigration appears to be top-of-mind for Trump's presidency, at least initially. In his 100-day plan, Trump promised to cancel federal funding to ""sanctuary cities,"" though he hasn't specified which funds he would cut. There's no legal definition for this type of city; it's used to describe places with policies limiting how much local authorities can collaborate with federal authorities on immigration issues, such as detention requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to CNN.

Trump has also promised to undo all of President Obama's executive actions, which include two on immigration (only one of which is in effect). Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals allows certain people brought to the country illegally as children to apply for protection against deportation for two-year periods. That protection would go away, it seems.

Trump has also promised to deport immigrants in the country illegally who have committed crimes, stop immigration from ""terror-prone"" regions and begin ""extreme vetting"" of people entering the U.S. He has also mostly stood by his vow to build a wall on the country's southern border, and make Mexico pay for it. Trump and some surrogates have said recently they would be OK with certain areas of the border having fence, rather than wall.

Relevant stories

Social Security

Trump does not want to privatize Social Security, nor does he want to raise the retirement age or increase taxes. He told AARP he plans to fund the entitlement program through ""an economy that is robust and growing,"" and he specifically highlighted his tax and immigration plans as key players in that growth.

Relevant stories

Education

Trump has been vocal about school choice, which allows parents to choose to send their child to any type of school: traditional public, private or charter. Critics say school choice leads to a gap in equitable school investment. Proponents say it increases competition between schools. In addition to school choice, Trump wants to end the Common Core standards, which are the federal guidelines created for K-12 education across the country. States were able to choose to opt in (some didn't) — and the federal government encouraged it.

Relevant stories

Supreme Court Appointments

Trump has released two lists, adding up to 21 judges, to fill the Supreme Court vacancy resulting from Antonin Scalia's death last February. According to NPR's Nina Totenberg, the lists are very conservative and a lot is unknown about who is helping Trump make this selection. With two other justices over 80 years old, it's possible Trump will be able to nominate more than one justice during his presidency.

Relevant stories

The Treatment of Racial and Ethnic Minorities

The relationship between police and their treatment of African-Americans was a common topic this election year. Trump ran as the ""law and order"" candidate and he's sticking to it: He plans on increasing funding for federal law enforcement ""to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars."" He also wants to provide more funding and training to local police departments.

Trump has been criticized for his own rhetoric on minorities, most notably referring to Mexican immigrants as rapists in his June 2015 announcement speech and calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.

But what’s unclear is how this will cut for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. That’s because the normal electoral dynamics don’t apply this year.

As hard as it is to ignore all the talk about emails and groping, the economy ranks as the most important concern for Americans, according to the most recent Gallup survey -- a finding that has remained constant throughout this rollicking election season.

At the core of both candidates’ campaigns are pledges to juice economic growth through amped-up versions of their parties’ traditional solutions: for Clinton, taxing the rich and boosting federal spending; for Trump, slashing taxes, especially for the wealthy, and cutting government regulations.

Despite some encouraging economic indicators recently, the recovery that began in early 2009 is the slowest in the post-World War II era, averaging about 2 percent yearly. After two terms with a Democrat in the White House, that has given Republican nominee Trump an opening. Thanks to Clinton’s party, “we have surrendered our status as the world’s greatest economy,” he told the New York Economic Club in September.

As the candidate of the incumbent party, whose president has a high approval rating, Clinton is in the tricky position of presenting herself as the same, but different. Taking a populist page from her defeated Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, she said in a June speech that she wants “an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.”

The standard rhythm of postwar presidential politics gives one party two terms, then the other party takes over. The only time that pattern got disrupted was in 1988, when George H.W. Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan. Then, the economy was soaring. (Bush lost four years later, thanks to the aftermath of a recession.)

This year, the economy’s tepid if relatively steady progress makes the situation murkier. While prospects aren’t great for laid-off industrial workers and those without a college education, life isn’t bad for a lot of the workforce. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, a figure that customarily means a healthy jobs picture -- and it represents a vast improvement from when Barack Obama assumed office, when joblessness was more than twice the current number.

That’s why Comerica Bank chief economist Robert Dye calls the present economic era “the Great OK.”

Certainly, the big X factor in the 2016 election is character: Will the personalities and personas of Clinton and Trump end up elbowing aside the economy as the deciding electoral influence? Polls show both carry heavy baggage when it comes to likability and trustworthiness. Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, a staunch conservative, notes that a more conventional Republican like Marco Rubio would handily dispatch Clinton. She calls Trump a “screwball.”

For voters, the economic questions boil down to several key topics:

GDP growth. Is it actually possible to restore growth to a robust level? Trump promises to step up its tempo to 3.5 percent or higher and bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Clinton hasn’t put a number on her growth goal, but believes massive spending on rebuilding infrastructure, like roads and bridges, and subsidizing college education will deliver the goods. Trump also wants a large infrastructure effort.

Even if the candidates’ programs could get the assent of a truculent Congress, where Tea Party sentiment animates the House GOP ranks, they face daunting headwinds. The economy simply doesn’t have much get up and go, amid listless expansion in consumer spending, housing and business investment.

Even the promising third-quarter GDP increase of 2.9 percent annualized may not be as good as it looks. For instance, the GDP got a likely one-time boost from an unexpected bonanza in soybean exports, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Worse, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that GDP growth will inch along at 2 percent yearly through 2026.

A larger problem may be what some economists call “secular stagnation.” This thesis holds that the U.S has benefited from good timing, but now those lovely days are over. With the rest of the globe in ruins after World War II, the U.S. enjoyed a decades-long growth surge that petered out as competing countries gathered strength.

Along with that, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers believes an aging population in the U.S., and in the West generally, is sapping economic energy as baby boomers retire. More broadly, economist Robert J. Gordon argues that right now, no transforming technologies have shown up to spur growth, nothing to compare with what he calls “the great inventions of the past,” such as Henry Ford’s auto assembly line.

Jobs. The best anyone can say about the employment environment is that it’s like the Three Bears’ porridge. “Employment gains remain modest -- not too hot, not too cold,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in response to the latest numbers. Few notice that the bears had to settle for porridge, instead of a three-egg omelette with tomato and avocado.

Despite the apparently sunny news about a 4.9 percent jobless rate, a more encompassing view of the labor market shows a major weakness. The labor participation rate, which measures who in the population is working, has suffered a noticeable drop. Because of boomer retirements, millennials going back to school for want of a good job and others who have shucked the working life, that rate has dropped to 62.8 percent from a high of 67 percent in January 2000.

Trump has emphasized losses in the manufacturing sector, which are considerable. In 1970, more than 25 percent of U.S. employees worked in manufacturing, but in 2016, only 9 percent do. However, shipping these jobs overseas is only part of the cause. Numerous academic studies have shown that technology has destroyed far more American manufacturing jobs than China or Mexico. In fact, automation has enhanced U.S. manufacturing output in the process of using fewer workers.

Trump proposes slapping high tariffs on China and other nations he sees as job pirates. Plus, he seeks to expand domestic oil and gas production, which he views as shackled by regulations. This will bring back employment to these shores, he says.

Clinton wants, through education and grants, to encourage knowledge-based jobs, particularly in clean energy. The most credible critique of both these approaches is that history has shown Washington can help job creation merely at the margin.

Taxes. Since the Reagan administration, an argument has raged about whether lower taxes lead to economic growth. This is at the heart of the Clinton-Trump divide.

They have dramatically different ideas about taxes. She wishes to raise them on people earning $250,000 year or more, to pay for her ambitious federal spending plans. He calls for tax reductions across the board.

By the reckoning of the Tax Foundation think tank, even the lowest earners, making up to $12,521, would get something under Trump, an average $97. With Trump’s proposal, the highest earners ($469,550 and up) would receive $135,460 on average.

Federal deficit. The result of their taxing and spending frameworks shows up most prominently here. Another longstanding GOP-Democrat quarrel revolves around how much red ink the government should spill and whether it will hinder the economy.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that in 10 years, Trump would enlarge the deficit by $5.3 trillion and Clinton by far less, $200 billion. That translates to a national debt of 105 percent of GDP under Trump and 86 percent under Clinton (which is the level already expected under current law). Now, it’s 77 percent.

Trade. Targeting American voters upset at foreign competition, they both take a tough line on trade pacts. Clinton, who once supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Asian nations and others, switched sides. Trump opposes the TPP, which is now pending, and he aims to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, negotiated in the 1990s by Clinton’s husband.

Clinton and Trump both claim the other would lead the nation to economic ruin. But even in this unprecedented election campaign, one thing seems clear: Their stances on economic revival will weigh heavily on voters’ minds when pulling the lever."

""There are two differences, one is interest rates and the other's inflation,"" Rutledge, who was one of the chief architects of Reagan's economic plan, told ""Squawk on the Street.""

Rutledge, chief investment officer at Safanad, said that when Reagan came into office, inflation was in a downturn.

Today, ""we've got eight years of monetary stimulus, an extraordinarily tight labor market, and margins that have been squeezed by rising labor costs and soft prices,"" all of which are reversing on improved expectations for growth, he said.

And in 2017, contrary to the Reagan era, inflation will be on the uptick, Rutledge said.

""We've got a year coming here where the labor price pressure is pushing though into product prices [and] inflation numbers are up. That's why you see the bond yields up, because inflation's coming around, which means I would prefer stocks that are protected from inflation and not the ones that will be hurt by inflation,"" he contended.

But they are more divided on other questions, including whether to deport some or all of the nation’s estimated 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants.

About eight-in-ten Trump supporters who cast ballots or were planning to in the days leading up to the election (79%) said illegal immigration was a “very big” problem in the U.S., according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted just before Election Day. Even more (86%) said the immigration situation in the U.S. has “gotten worse” since 2008.

But while 79% of pro-Trump registered voters said in an August survey that they favored building a wall on the Mexican border, they did not take as hard a line when it came to the status of those who are already living in the U.S. illegally.

In an October survey, 60% of voters who supported Trump said undocumented immigrants should be able to stay in the U.S. if they meet certain requirements, compared with 37% who said they should not. Only about a third (32%) of Trump supporters said there should be a “national law enforcement effort to deport” all undocumented immigrants.

Trump supporters also did not indicate a high level of concern about unauthorized immigrants taking jobs from U.S. citizens when surveyed in August. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) said unauthorized immigrants “mostly fill jobs American citizens don’t want.” (In 2014, the most recent year for which data are available, there were 8 million unauthorized immigrants either working or looking for work in the U.S., according to Pew Research Center estimates based on government data.)

However, half of Trump supporters said undocumented immigrants are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes. Among all registered voters, just 27% expressed this view.

Since the election, Trump himself has continued to address many of the positions he articulated on the campaign trail regarding illegal immigration. In an interview shortly after his election, he again promised to build a wall on the southern border and said his administration would seek to deport up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants with criminal records, leaving open the possibility of deporting others in the future.

The president-elect has also indicated he will end the employment of undocumented immigrants. His campaign website says the new administration will “turn off the jobs and benefits magnet,” adding that “many immigrants come to the U.S. illegally in search of jobs, even though federal law prohibits the employment of illegal immigrants.”

In Pew Research Center’s post-election survey, conducted Nov. 10-14, more than half of Trump supporters (55%) said they have confidence in the new president to “do the right thing” when it comes to illegal immigration. Trump scored higher among his supporters on two other issues (the economy and the threat of terrorism), and about the same on a third (health care)."

His campaign has been unusually sparse on economic policy details, so it’s helpful to look at the people who have been advising Trump during the campaign season — and are likely to play key roles in the Trump administration.

Trump first unveiled a list of his economic advisers back in August, and it is about what you’d expect from the real estate tycoon.

He has vowed to bring a more businesslike approach to government; his list is dominated by businessmen — including several billionaires. He has railed against political correctness; his economic advisers are entirely white men. He has disparaged conventional policy experts; the list includes only one academic economist.

The names on Trump’s economic team suggest that — aside from trade issues — his policies wouldn’t be radically different from those of previous Republican administrations. Republican administrations are traditionally friendly to big businesses and wealthy people, and these groups are well-represented on the list. The list even includes a devoted supply-sider from the conservative Heritage Foundation, suggesting that Trump may follow through on his promise for a broad tax cut.

Trump’s advisers

This was the list that Trump presented in August:

Tom Barrack, Colony Capital

Andy Beal, Beal Bank

Stephen Calk, Federal Savings Bank

Dan DiMicco, former CEO of Nucor

Steve Feinberg, Cerberus Capital Management

Dan Kowalski, deputy policy adviser for the Trump campaign

Howard Lorber, Vector Group

David Malpass, Encima Global

Steven Mnuchin, Dune Capital

Stephen Moore, Heritage Foundation

Peter Navarro, University of California Irvine

John Paulson, Paulson & Co.

Steve Roth, Vornado Realty

Trump recruited some distinguished business leaders

The businesspeople on Trump’s list include several distinguished names. Hedge fund manager John Paulson became famous in 2007 when he made billions betting against the housing market. Steve Roth built a billion-dollar real estate empire in New York.

Andy Beal made billions in real estate while also becoming an accomplished poker player and number theorist. He developed the Beal conjecture, a mathematical proposition related to Fermat’s Last Theorem, and then funded a $1 million prize for anyone who could solve it. And like Paulson, he saw the 2008 crash coming. He stopped buying during the last years of the real estate boom, 2004 to 2007, leaving him with plenty of cash on hand to snap up bargains in the post-crash environment of 2009.

Private equity investor Stephen Feinberg is worth more than $1 billion, but he doesn’t share Donald Trump’s taste for ostentatious displays of wealth. ""In general, I think that all of us are way overpaid in this business,"" he said in 2011. ""It is almost embarrassing.""

Also on the list: Howard Lorber, who has major holdings in cigarettes as well as real estate.

In short, Trump has assembled an independent-minded and opinionated collection of rich businessmen. They could provide a valuable conduit for dissenting points of view that — judging from the way Trump has run his campaigns and his businesses — might otherwise be lacking from a Trump administration.

The list is short on real economics and policy expertise

It’s customary for presidential candidates — especially Republican presidential candidates — to include some business leaders among their economic advisers, but most candidates also include people with significant academic expertise or government experience.

John McCain’s list of economic advisers included six economics professors and three other people who were chief economists for private companies. McCain’s list also had about a dozen people with government experience, including several veterans of the George W. Bush administration. Mitt Romney also drew heavily on credentialed economists with senior government experience.

In contrast, Trump’s list includes only one academic economist, Peter Navarro of the University of California Irvine. David Malpass served in several midlevel government positions during the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Tom Barrack was deputy undersecretary for the Department of the Interior during the Reagan administration. The list also includes conservative activist and former Wall Street Journal economics writer Stephen Moore.

The character of Trump’s list may have to do with the candidate’s belief that he’d be better off without the help of government veterans and credentialed academics. It also might have to do with the fact that the most experienced economic policy hands in the Republican Party have largely shunned Trump.

Greg Mankiw, for example, is a Harvard economist who served in the George W. Bush administration. In a recent blog post, he wrote that Trump wouldn’t get his vote because he finds Trump’s protectionist views ""disqualifying."" John McCain’s top 2008 economic adviser — and former head of the Congressional Budget Office — Douglas Holtz-Eakin savaged Trump's economic ideas, describing his plans for mass deportation of immigrants as “utterly unworkable.”

Glenn Hubbard, Mitt Romney’s top economic adviser and former adviser to George W. Bush, hasn’t been too kind to Trump either. He argues that Trump’s trade policies would “raise the prices of consumer goods for all Americans, raising the cost of living especially for the poor.”

One side effect of academic distaste for Trump is that a man who needs seasoned policy advice more than any other recent president may start off with a very shallow bench of trusted advisers with real economic policy expertise.

That’s a problem, because while businesspeople have a lot of valuable insights about the economy, there are some aspects of economic policy where formal training is indispensable. A successful career in business doesn’t give anyone insights about monetary policy or allow them to navigate the intricacies of the federal budget process. For some aspects of federal policy, there’s no substitute for careful study combined with practical experience.

Aside from trade, Trump’s agenda doesn’t look that different from that of past Republicans

By naming former steel executive Dan DiMicco as an economic adviser, Trump is underscoring his commitment to protectionist trade policies — a sharp contrast with other recent Republican administrations. DiMicco wrote a 2015 book calling for manufacturing jobs to be brought back to the United States. Like Trump, DiMicco blames recent trade deals and foreign countries that don’t ""play by the rules"" for declining employment in the manufacturing sector.

But Trump’s other choices suggest more continuity with past Republican policies. Stephen Moore now works for the Heritage Foundation, which has played a key role in Republican policymaking since the Reagan administration. He’s a devoted supply-sider, and we can expect him to push Trump to follow through on his promises for big tax cuts.

And while Trump has sought to paint Clinton as a tool of Wall Street, his own economic advisers have extensive Wall Street connections. One of them, Steven Mnuchin, is even a veteran of Goldman Sachs, a frequent target of Trump’s ire. This suggests we might need to take Trump’s populist rhetoric about Wall Street with a grain of salt."

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his surrogates would be wielding the disappointing May jobs report as a cudgel to bash the lackluster ""Obama-Clinton"" recovery. After all, polls say jobs and the economy remain voters' biggest concern. And it's an issue in which Trump has a big lead over Clinton. A new Gallup poll gives the famed businessman a 10-point edge on ""the economy"" and a seven-point lead on ""employment and jobs.""

But Trump isn't talking about the economy. Instead, he's attacking the Mexican heritage of the Trump University lawsuit judge, speculating on the potential bias of Muslim judges, and instructing his surrogates to attack any and all critics as racists.

Trump seems unable to see it, but a lousy economy remains the greatest threat to Clinton's White House hopes, and thus the greatest aid for Trump's presidential bid. The anemic recovery hardly seems a tailwind for Clinton's campaign. A year ago, Yale economist Ray Fair, well known for using the economy to predict elections, said continued sluggish-though-improving GDP growth implied ""a fairly large loss for the Democrats.""

Since then, the economy hasn't picked up. Fair has noted that the economy, ""in terms of the growth rate of GDP, is clearly not a plus for the Democrats in 2016. This could, of course, be trumped by other factors."" Ah yes, economist humor. But he's right. Non-economic factors matter, too — like if one major candidate suffers from maniacal narcissism and a proclivity to utter bigoted comments. Millions upon millions of voters may ultimately decide Trump is simply unfit for office even if real disposable income and the labor force participation rate stay steady but meh.

But what if the economy doesn't stay in this same-old, same-old mode? What if is worsens sharply?

That's why Team Clinton should pay close attention to that jobs report, even if Trump isn't. Job growth has slowed sharply, a possible harbinger of deeper economic trouble. Not only did the jobs report show a meager 38,000 net jobs created last month, but totals for March and April were also revised considerably lower. Over the past three months, then, job gains have averaged 116,000 per month. That's about half the average monthly gain since 2010. Barclays recently explained why this is worrisome: Essentially, this sort of molasses-slow job growth signals ""that risks of a near- to medium-term recession have risen.""

That's essentially the same conclusion from JPMorgan's economic team. JPMorgan's model doesn't look at job growth, but other factors such as the unemployment rate, auto sales, and consumer sentiment. And based on those variables and others, the bank sees a 36 percent chance of a recession within a year, the highest so far during the seven-year-old expansion.

The risk of recession is increasing, Still, it's not exactly likely between now and Election Day.

But here's the thing none of these models factor in: the impact of Trump himself. He could become his very own October Surprise through what I have termed the Trump Doom Loop — the negative feedback effects among markets, politics, and the U.S. economy. The better Trump does in the polls, the more people around the world will worry, and the worse it will be for economic confidence... and thus the better Trump does in the polls.

For instance, in a recent op-ed, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers predicted Trump's tax and trade policies would cause ""a protracted recession to begin within 18 months"" of his election. If the polls stay close, and if Summers' opinion is widely shared, the Trump Doom Loop could begin. People will worry about the real possibility of President Trump. The economy will tank because of that plummeting confidence and rising uncertainty. And Trump will (falsely, but effectively) point to the tanking economy as a failure of the Democrats.

Desperate voters, already pessimistic about the future, might be willing to gamble on Trump in that case — despite qualms about his character, or lack of it."
