Notwithstanding President-elect Joe Biden’s solid popular vote victory, last week’s election failed to deliver the kind of transformative reorientation of the nation’s political-economic map that Democrats (and some Republicans) had hoped for. The data confirms that the election sharpened the striking geographic divide between red and blue America, instead of dispelling it.

Most notably, the stark economic rift that Brookings Metro documented after Donald Trump’s shocking 2016 victory has grown even wider. In 2016, we wrote that the 2,584 counties that Trump won generated just 36% of the country’s economic output, whereas the 472 counties Hillary Clinton carried equated to almost two-thirds of the nation’s aggregate economy.

A similar analysis for last week’s election shows these trends continuing, albeit with a different political outcome. This time, Biden’s winning base in 509 counties encompasses fully 71% of America’s economic activity, while Trump’s losing base of 2,547 counties represents just 29% of the economy. (Votes are still outstanding in 28 mostly low-output counties, and this piece will be updated as new data is reported.)

Table 1. Candidates’ counties won and share of GDP in 2016 and 2020

Year Candidate Counties won Total votes Aggregate share of US GDP 2016 Hillary Clinton 472 65,853,625 64% Donald Trump 2,584 62,985,106 36% 2020 Joe Biden 520 81,283,098 71% Donald Trump 2,564 74,222,958 29%

Note: 2020 figures reflect unofficial results from 99% of counties. Figures for 2020 represent results from 100% of counties for which 2018 GDP data are available. Some county equivalents have been consolidated into counties to match the geography of BEA GDP data.

So, while the election’s winner may have changed, the nation’s economic geography remains rigidly divided. Biden captured virtually all of the counties with the biggest economies in the country (depicted by the largest blue tiles in the nearby graphic), including flipping the few that Clinton did not win in 2016.

By contrast, Trump won thousands of counties in small-town and rural communities with correspondingly tiny economies (depicted by the red tiles). Biden’s counties tended to be far more diverse, educated, and white-collar professional, with their aggregate nonwhite and college-educated shares of the economy running to 35% and 36%, respectively, compared to 16% and 25% in counties that voted for Trump.

In short, 2020’s map continues to reflect a striking split between the large, dense, metropolitan counties that voted Democratic and the mostly exurban, small-town, or rural counties that voted Republican. Blue and red America reflect two very different economies: one oriented to diverse, often college-educated workers in professional and digital services occupations, and the other whiter, less-educated, and more dependent on “traditional” industries.

With that said, it would be wrong to describe this as a completely static map. While the metropolitan/ nonmetropolitan dichotomy remained starkly persistent, 2020 election returns produced nontrivial movement, as Biden added modestly to the Democrats’ metropolitan base and significantly to its vote base. Most notably, Biden flipped six of the nation’s 100 highest-output counties, strengthening the link between these core economic hubs and the Democratic Party. More specifically, Biden flipped half of the 10 most economically significant counties Trump won in 2016, including Phoenix’s Maricopa County; Dallas-Fort Worth’s Tarrant County; Jacksonville, Fla.’s Duval County; Morris County in New Jersey; and Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.’s Pinellas County.

Altogether, those losses shaved about 3 percentage points’ worth of GDP off the economic base of Trump counties. That reduced the share of the nation’s GDP produced by Republican-voting counties to a new low in recent times.

Why does this matter? This economic rift that persists in dividing the nation is a problem because it underscores the near-certainty of both continued clashes between the political parties and continued alienation and misunderstandings.

To start with, the 2020’s sharpened economic divide forecasts gridlock in Congress and between the White House and Senate on the most important issues of economic policy. The problem—as we have witnessed over the past decade and are likely to continue seeing—is not only that Democrats and Republicans disagree on issues of culture, identity, and power, but that they represent radically different swaths of the economy. Democrats represent voters who overwhelmingly reside in the nation’s diverse economic centers, and thus tend to prioritize housing affordability, an improved social safety net, transportation infrastructure, and racial justice. Jobs in blue America also disproportionately rely on national R&D investment, technology leadership, and services exports.

By contrast, Republicans represent an economic base situated in the nation’s struggling small towns and rural areas. Prosperity there remains out of reach for many, and the party sees no reason to consider the priorities and needs of the nation’s metropolitan centers. That is not a scenario for economic consensus or achievement.

At the same time, the results from last week’s election likely underscore fundamental problems of economic alienation and estrangement. Specifically, Trump’s anti-establishment appeal suggests that a sizable portion of the country continues to feel little connection to the nation’s core economic enterprises, and chose to channel that animosity into a candidate who promised not to build up all parts of the country, but rather to vilify groups who didn’t resemble his base.

If this pattern continues—with one party aiming to confront the challenges at top of mind for a majority of Americans, and the other continuing to stoke the hostility and indignation held by a significant minority—it will be a recipe not only for more gridlock and ineffective governance, but also for economic harm to nearly all people and places. In light of the desperate need for a broad, historic recovery from the economic damage of the COVID-19 pandemic, a continuation of the patterns we’ve seen play out over the past decade would be a particularly unsustainable situation for Americans in communities of all sizes."

While most metrics of economic activity have risen from the record-shattering lows they hit in March and April, the pace of improvement has slowed, and analysts worry that burgeoning Covid-19 case numbers will throttle the hard-won economic momentum the country has eked out so far.

It won’t be easy. Control of the Senate is still up in the air, but many believe it’s likely that Congress’s upper chamber might still have have a Republican majority with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, as Majority Leader. Although Biden has referenced his work with McConnell in the past to bolster his credentials as a politician who can successfully work across the aisle, McConnell’s public backing of President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede on Monday was, if nothing else, a clear indication that bipartisanship will be elusive for Biden.

“With a divided Congress, a handful of the major legislative priorities of a Biden administration seem unlikely,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird. “Any kind of major corporate tax hike or wealth tax seems incredibly unlikely with a Republican Senate.”

""Pfizer's progress towards a vaccine is promising, but does not negate the need for lawmakers to act in the near term.""

Despite Biden positioning himself as a centrist, economists aren’t expecting much across-the-aisle cooperation. After a stimulus deal is passed, “I think it’s going to be difficult to do much beyond that, legislatively,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.

Although Biden will be unable to put most of his — and his party’s — boldest initiatives into action, Zandi said the new president would likely implement a flurry of executive orders, many targeted at undoing policies Trump had unilaterally imposed the same way. “Biden’s going to reverse Trump on trade, on immigration, on climate change, on banking regulations,"" he said. “It’s not big, fundamental shifts… it’s more incremental.”

Economists say these are the week-one, day-one challenges Biden will face as soon as he is sworn in — and how he might be able to meet them.

Corral the coronavirus

Although a public health crisis first and foremost, experts agree that containing and lowering the burgeoning number of Covid-19 cases is the only way to alleviate the economic crisis that has gripped the country since March. Getting the virus under control will ensure that stores, restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues can stay open, and that Americans will have the confidence — and the disposable income — to take flights, attend ball games, eat out at restaurants and shop in stores.

“He’s going to encourage the governors to recommend that face masks be mandatory in order to try and improve the chance of the economy opening as quickly as possible,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “I think everybody realizes that more action is needed.”

His administration will need to invest in people, equipment and technology to improve the availability and accuracy of testing, production and dissemination of PPE and development of virus-mitigation and contract tracing protocols — all goals endorsed by public health officials. However, observers caution that Biden could run into resistance from Republican Congress members and governors over issues such as mask mandates and increased funds for testing and contact tracing.

Get America more stimulus

Congress was unable to come to an agreement on the terms of a stimulus package before the election. Economists are divided on whether or not — and when — another tranche of aid might be forthcoming. “Any kind of coronavirus fiscal stimulus legislation still seems likely, [but] some of the good recent economic data shows economic momentum that has pared the appetite for a big bill,” Mayfield said.

Most analysts, along with top officials like Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, do agree that additional stimulus is needed. The progress announced by Pfizer on Monday towards a Covid-19 vaccine was promising, some said, but did not negate the need for lawmakers to act in the near term.

“Regardless of the path of the virus, I think there's pretty high awareness across the partisan spectrum that there needs to be some sort of bill to carry this recovery across the finish line,” Mayfield said.

A worsening public health picture could incentivize lawmakers to work quickly, some said. “Majority Leader McConnell’s reluctance to move ahead with a relief bill the last few months suggests it will be uphill sledding — though one might note that many experts expect the pandemic to be considerably worse by the time Biden is sworn in, which may make the politics of a broad relief and recovery effort somewhat more feasible,” said Mason B. Williams, a political science professor at Williams College.

Bring back jobs

A growing number of job losses are shifting from temporary to permanent, an ominous change labor economists say will get worse between now and the inauguration, particularly if the current alarming trajectory of case growth continues unchecked.

Economists agree that, even if a Biden White House is able to get a sufficient handle on Covid-19 to avoid reimposition of shutdowns, Americans will need the means as well as the willingness to spend. Securing more stimulus is an important first step, Stovall said. “He would want to focus on stimulus right away to save as many jobs as he can,” he said. With consumer spending the biggest contributor to GDP, putting money in the pockets of ordinary Americans is a quick way to insulate the jobs of countless cashiers, cooks, hairstylists, hotel staffers and others in high-contact service-sector positions.

Mayfield said another way Biden could contribute to job gains would be to coordinate more PPE production at American factories. “I think you’ll probably see some effort on some things like utilizing the Defense Production Act to mobilize some U.S. manufacturing,” he said. This would have a multifaceted impact touching on a few different Biden administration priorities: Adding jobs, securing enough PPE to combat Covid-19 and revitalizing American manufacturing with an eye towards rebuilding.

“In proposing a Public Health Jobs Corps, Biden is wisely copying from the New Deal’s playbook of providing short-term ‘emergency’ employment.""

Biden’s transition website calls for establishing a 100,000-person job corps to combat the coronavirus. “In proposing a Public Health Jobs Corps, Biden is wisely copying from the New Deal’s playbook of providing short-term ‘emergency’ employment in ways that will stimulate long-term economic growth,” Williams said.

Although hailed by some as a proactive way to tackle the nation’s considerable public health as well as economic challenges, this proposal would likely face resistance from Congressional Republicans. Likewise, Biden’s proposals to develop jobs in sectors as diverse as infrastructure, green energy and child- and elder-caregiving all would require the kind of spending outlays he would be unlikely to wrest from a GOP-led Senate.

“Republican Senators are even less likely to support Biden’s spending priorities than they would be likely to support some of Trump’s spending priorities,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for the Independent Advisor Alliance."

The economy is consistently a top voting issue. In a survey asking a similar, though not identical, list of issues in June 2016, the economy also was the top voting issue.

In the current survey, 68% of voters say health care is very important to their vote, while 64% cite Supreme Court appointments.

As the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus outbreak, 62% of voters say the outbreak will be a very important factor in their decision about who to support in the fall.

About six-in-ten (59%) say violent crime will be very important to their 2020 decision, and 57% say this about foreign policy.

Immigration and racial and ethnic inequality rank toward the lower end of the list for voters (52% each call these issues very important to their vote).

Fewer than half say climate change (42%) or abortion (40%) will be very important factors in their decision (though majorities say these issues will be at least somewhat important to them).

Trump and Biden voters diverge over importance of COVID-19 to their vote this fall

There are stark differences in how registered voters who support Donald Trump and Joe Biden view the importance of these issues. In fact, of 12 issues included, the only ones that comparable shares of Biden supporters and Trump supporters view as very important are foreign policy and Supreme Court appointments.

For Trump supporters, the economy (88%) and violent crime (74%) are the most salient issues. Roughly six-in-ten Trump supporters cite immigration (61%), gun policy (60%) and foreign policy (57%) as very important to their vote.

By contrast, the largest shares of Biden supporters view health care (84%) and the coronavirus outbreak (82%) as very important. A sizable majority also rates racial and ethnic inequality as important to their vote (76%).

While there are substantial differences between Trump and Biden supporters on the importance of most issues, the widest gaps are on climate change (57 percentage points) and racial and ethnic inequality (52 points).

In addition, Biden supporters are more than twice as likely than Trump supporters to say the coronavirus outbreak (82% of Biden supporters, 39% of Trump supporters) and economic inequality (65% of Biden supporters, 28% of Trump supporters) as very important.

Larger shares of Trump than Biden supporters say violent crime (74% vs. 46%), immigration (61% vs. 46%) and gun policy (60% vs. 50%) are very important to their decision about who to vote for in 2020.

Republicans lead on the economy; Democrats have advantages on climate, health, racial issues

Among registered voters, the Republican Party holds a 9 percentage point edge over the Democrats on the issue of being better able to handle the economy (49% Republican Party, 40% Democratic Party). And as has been the case for many years, more voters say the GOP could do a better job than the Democratic Party on terrorism (46% vs. 37%).

By contrast, the Democratic Party holds wide advantages among voters on climate change (58% to 27% over the GOP), abortion and contraception (51% to 36%) and health care (51% t0 37%). In addition, the Democratic Party has 12-point leads on handling the public health impact of the coronavirus and issues involving race and ethnicity.

On other issues, including immigration, gun policy, the federal budget deficit and law enforcement and criminal justice, neither party has a significant edge among voters."

President-elect Joe Biden is set to inherit an economy that was absolutely battered in 2020.

We've seen record unemployment, businesses declaring bankruptcy and an eviction crisis. We're also headed into winter, a time when Covid-19 is expected to claim the lives of tens of thousands more Americans, devastate hospital systems nationwide and potentially lead to another round of rolling lockdowns.

""There are things happening that very much feel like a runaway train when it comes to the U.S. economy,"" said Stefanie Miller, managing director at FiscalNote Markets.

This year, pandemic policy is economic policy. A big part of Joe Biden's message on the campaign trail came down to how he was the better person to combat the pandemic's devastating impact on the economy. It's a promise that experts say he's going to need to deliver on fast.

""First and foremost, no one can really move forward without control over the pandemic,"" said Dewardric McNeal, managing director at Longview Global. ""The big rock in our rucksack is a stimulus deal.""

Striking a stimulus deal is only one part of Biden's pandemic recovery plan. What he actually wants is something much bigger: for the country to spend over $7 trillion on initiatives such as infrastructure, which includes the creation of 10 million clean-energy jobs, and on housing, education, economic fairness and health care. He's bundled all his ideas under the slogan Build Back Better.

The question now is: Will his plan work? Watch this video to learn more about how Biden plans to pay for all this — and whether Congress will support it."
5,Trump paints apocalyptic portrait of life in US under Biden - The Associated Press,Trump paints apocalyptic portrait of life in US under Biden  The Associated Press,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VsZWN0aW9uLTIwMjAtam9lLWJpZGVuLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1wb2xpY2UtZWNvbm9teS0zMDgyYjk5NWMxZmQ4OTEyOTY3MWIyNDU3OTdiYzkwMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The suburbs wouldn’t be the suburbs anymore, the economy would sink into its worst depression ever and police departments would cease to exist. Even America’s older adults would be left to figure out how to get by without heat, air conditioning or electricity.

This is the apocalyptic version of American life that President Donald Trump argues would be the dire consequence of turning over the White House to Democrat Joe Biden.

“He’ll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs,” Trump said in one of many over-the-top pronouncements about Biden in the campaign’s final weeks. Trump typically makes his warning about the fate of suburbia as he showcases his own decision to end federal regulations that govern the placement of low-incoming housing in the suburbs.

Campaign rhetoric can often become heated and hyperbolic as candidates scrap for every last advantage before the votes are counted.

Experts say instilling fear in one’s opponent is usually the primary motivating factor behind such talk as candidates seek to give voters a reason to put a checkmark next to their name on the ballot.

“It’s pure fear and fear based on a particular kind of ignorance that only works if your hearers have that particular kind of ignorance,” Robin Lakoff, professor emerita of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said of Trump’s claims about Biden.

Trump made fear — particularly the fear of immigrants — a major theme of his 2016 campaign. Now, he is giving voters a laundry list of mostly implausible reasons to fear a Biden presidency.

“This election is a choice between a TRUMP RECOVERY or a BIDEN DEPRESSION,” the president tweeted, echoing what he tells supporters at rallies. “It’s a choice between a TRUMP BOOM or a BIDEN LOCKDOWN. It’s a choice between our plan to Kill the virus – or Biden’s plan to kill the American Dream!”

Trump has criticized Biden for saying he’d follow the scientists, and the president claims the Democrat would shut the country down. In fact, Biden hasn’t said whether he’d endorse large-scale shutdowns of the nation’s economy, if things get drastically worse, like much of the country did in March.

“If you vote for Biden, it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas and no Fourth of July together,” Trump said at a rally Wednesday in Goodyear, Arizona. “Other than that, you have a wonderful life.”

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump’s rhetoric is effective with people who are already disposed to believe such things about Biden. But to a person who is not in the audience, she said, such talk is a “sign of desperation.”

“The problem with the rhetoric is it’s an alienating rhetoric for people who hear it as extreme and improbable,” Jamieson said. It’s also problematic, she said, “because you expect a president of the United States to calibrate his rhetoric to reality in at least some plausible way.”

Last week in Florida, Trump sought to boost his standing among older Americans angered by his response to the coronavirus by portraying Biden as the one who would do them harm. Trump falsely said Biden’s energy plan “would mean that America’s seniors have no air conditioning during the summer, no heat during the winter and no electricity during peak hours.”

During a summer of unrest that followed the police killings of Black men, Trump sought to portray Biden as beholden to the “radical-left” forces Trump claimed were behind the protests. He also argued that Biden wouldn’t be able to keep such unrest from spreading to the suburbs.

David Zarefsky, who teaches courses about presidential rhetoric at Northwestern, said close examination shows the weakness in Trump’s argument about Biden and the suburbs.

“I think most people would not put it together as being a sound argument,” said Zarefsky, a past president of the Rhetoric Society of America.

Leading Democrats have deployed their own dire talk.

In July, Biden said Trump was the country’s first racist president, which glossed over the presidents before Trump who had held slaves.

“We’ve had racists, and they’ve existed. They’ve tried to get elected president,” Biden said. “He’s the first one that has.”

And in his Democratic National Convention speech, former President Barack Obama said four more years of the Republican in the White House would jeopardize American democracy.

“That’s what’s at stake right now. Our democracy,” Obama said.

Jamieson said that claim is different because it is grounded in the president’s own norm-busting behavior, such as his attacks on the Justice Department and on the press, or his unfounded challenges to voting by mail and the legitimacy of Tuesday’s election.

“Those who are making the argument about Trump are offering evidence from his rhetoric and actions,” she said, adding that the attacks on Biden are “not justified by what he’s said or done.”

Vanessa Beasley, a professor of communication studies at Vanderbilt University, said all presidents fall back on “us versus them” rhetoric during campaigns, but that once in office the rhetoric is tempered by the reality of having to govern for all.

She cited Obama as an example, noting the disappointment among some of his supporters after he was elected and the aspirational “hope and change” rhetoric that helped power his political rise gave way to more measured discourse.

“The difference with Trump,” she added, “is that he never stops the ‘us versus them.’”

Beasley added that hyperbolic rhetoric can be optimistic, citing President Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America” campaign from the 1980s as a classic example.

“Hyperbole doesn’t always have to go to fear,” she said.

But Trump retains some important advantages, like more Americans believing he is the better candidate to lead the economy, which ranked as their top voting priority.

In a head-to-head match-up between the two major party candidates, Biden holds a double-digit lead over Trump, with 52 percent of registered voters supporting the Democratic candidate and 42 percent backing the Republican incumbent. When matched against third-party candidates, both Biden and Trump lose some registered voters, but Biden remains ahead at 49 percent over Trump’s 41 percent. Five percent of voters would pick Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen if given the option, and 2 percent would pick Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins, who is on the ballot in some states. In poll after poll since February, Biden leads Trump among registered voters, according to PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist data.

“There’s no question that Biden’s ahead at this point,” said Barbara Carvalho, who directs the Marist Poll.

But Trump still enjoys greater enthusiasm than his Democratic opponent — 79 percent of those who say they plan to vote for him are doing so because they support him, while 17 percent say it’s because they are against Biden. People who plan to vote for Biden are more evenly split in their reasoning, with 49 percent explicitly supporting him and 46 percent motivated more by voting against Trump.

“There’s no question that Biden’s ahead at this point.”

With Trump’s overall disapproval rating hovering at 53 percent — it hasn’t dropped below 50 percent since June 2019 — U.S. adults said Biden would do a better job as president on some of the issues most important to them, including COVID-19, where Biden has a 13-point lead on the president, and race relations, where Biden has a 21-point lead Asked what single issue matters most to them, 13 percent said the coronavirus, 11 percent said climate change (the most important issue among Democrats), while health care and race relations tied at 8 percent.

The greatest number, 20 percent, named the economy as their top issue, which was also the most important issue to Republicans. Facing a historic recession, half of Americans see Trump as a more effective leader on that issue, while another 43 percent favor Biden. That opinion gap has widened for Trump since August, when 47 percent of Americans thought he would better handle the economy. That support comes despite the economy faltering and the nation falling into the worst recession in decades under Trump’s leadership. For much of his presidency, Trump has portrayed himself as a leader who can produce a healthy economy, pointing to low unemployment numbers and record-high stock indexes, while also engaging in trade wars with China and other nations that have negatively impacted farm incomes, manufacturers and more.

Americans are split on who they think would do a better job leading on crime, with Biden showing a slight edge. That’s despite Trump’s aggressive strategy to position himself as the law and order candidate amid national demonstrations on racial justice and police brutality against Black Americans.

Coming out of 2019, things were looking up for Trump, political historian Allan Lichtman said, with a strong economy as the crown jewel for his reelection campaign.

“Everything changed in America in 2020,” Lichtman said. With a pandemic, a wounded economy that could plague the country for years and social and racial unrest, Lichtman, who has accurately forecasted the results of every presidential election since 1984, including Trump’s win in 2016, said his measures suggest Trump will lose this election.

2020 election security

After multiple investigations into the Trump administration’s ties to Russian election interference, and Trump himself suggesting he may question the integrity of the 2020 election, Americans’ belief that the country is ready to hold the next presidential election has remained resilient at 53 percent since January. Another 41 percent of U.S. adults say the country is not as prepared as it should be. That faith grows when people are thinking about their own state and local election boards: 69 percent of Americans feel very confident that the 2020 elections will be conducted fairly and accurately.

But the pandemic has thrown more confusion into the process, with fears about contracting the coronavirus at crowded polling stations driving many Americans to seek alternatives to voting in person on Election Day, such as voting by mail. Fifty-two percent of Americans say they feel confident that the U.S. Postal Service will deliver election-related mail to voters and election officials on time this year, despite turmoil over reported mail delays and Trump’s own efforts to discredit the method.

Registered voters are still more likely to vote in person on Election Day than by alternative means, with 46 percent saying they plan to do so, including 62 percent of Republicans and 45 percent of independents. Another 35 percent of voters plan to vote by mail or absentee ballot, an option preferred by half of all Democrats. An additional 14 percent of voters said they will go to an early voting location.

Earlier this month, Trump encouraged North Carolina voters to attempt to vote multiple times, both by mail and in person to ensure their votes were counted. As the North Carolina State Board of Elections said in a released statement, voting twice in an election is a criminal offense. On Thursday, Trump tweeted, without evidence, sentiments that have become a common refrain for the president: “Unsolicited Ballots are uncontrollable, totally open to ELECTION INTERFERENCE by foreign countries, and will lead to massive chaos and confusion!”

Twitter flagged Trump’s tweet with data and resources that show “voting by mail is legal and safe.”

Virtually no historical precedent exists for Trump’s calls for voter fraud in North Carolina, or his overall campaign to sow doubt about the 2020 election, said Jeffrey Engel, who directs the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. The closest the nation has come was when Southern states refused to include Abraham Lincoln’s name on the 1860 presidential ballot, he said.

Trump’s behavior “crosses an invisible but critical red line of delegitimizing the outcomes of the election,” Engel said. “Presidents haven’t done that.”

That’s reflected in the 51 percent of Americans who say Trump is encouraging election interference, including 91 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents. Another 38 percent of Americans believe, though, that Trump is making elections safer, including 84 percent of Republicans.

Coronavirus and trust

Going into the final stretch of his reelection bid, Trump has tried to stir optimism about the outlook for the coronavirus pandemic, even when top infectious disease experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, paint a different picture. On Wednesday, Trump claimed that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield was “confused” after Redfield testified to a Senate committee that any coronavirus vaccine was unlikely to be widely available for most Americans until spring or summer 2021. Redfield did not retract his statement.

A new book from journalist Bob Woodward revealed last week that Trump has said he knowingly played down the severity of the virus back in February. Meanwhile, the U.S. is approaching 200,000 deaths tied to the virus, while life for many remains disrupted by jobs lost, income gone and food and housing uncertain in many parts of the country.

Erosion of trust could be influencing the public’s willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

“I really do believe we’re rounding the corner,” Trump told reporters gathered on Sept. 10 at the White House.

Most Americans don’t share Trump’s optimism. More than two-thirds of U.S. adults — 69 percent — said that they think it’s going to be at least six months before daily life gets back to normal. That includes 86 percent of Democrats, 73 percent of independents and 48 percent of Republicans.

Mixed messages from the Trump administration and leading public health officials have made it difficult for Americans to know who to trust for information about the pandemic. Trump’s word garnered the least amount of confidence, with only a third of Americans saying they trust what he has to say about the virus. Confidence has also slipped substantially when it comes to the news media, state and local government officials, and even public health experts. The last group still conjures the greatest amount of trust, among 69 percent of Americans, but that’s down from 84 percent in March.

Erosion of trust could be influencing the public’s willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The number who said they would get the vaccine has dropped from 60 percent of Americans in August to 49 percent today, with 61 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of Republicans prepared to roll up a sleeve.

Misinformation and anti-vaccination talking points that cast doubt on the entire scientific method have been applied to this virus, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies infection and immunity at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. That misinformation has compromised many people’s understanding that science is credible, she said, so people are losing faith in fundamental elements of public health.

“People don’t know what to think,” Rasmussen said. “They don’t know if it’s going to be reliable or not. It’s going to make a lot of people who normally do get vaccinated skeptical of the process.”"

Key Priorities: Economy

Joe Biden

Increase investments in American-made products and companies, pouring $400 billion into procurement and $300 billion into research and development, with the aim of creating 5 million new jobs.

Reverse Trump tax breaks to corporations and seek a higher minimum wage and expanded benefits for low- and middle-income workers.

Read details of Biden's plans below.

Donald Trump

Create 10 million jobs in 10 months, as well as 1 million small businesses.

Push American companies outsourcing jobs in China back to the United States to establish 1 million new domestic jobs.

Read details of Trump's plans below.

Biden's Plans For The Economy

The Democratic nominee's economic plans center on his Build Back Better framework, with planks on such areas as increasing domestic manufacturing and investing in clean energy.

Biden's ""Made in America"" plan stands as his economic nationalist alternative to Trump's ""America First"" policy. It would spend $400 billion in procurement, increasing the demand for American-made goods, as well as $300 billion in technological research and development. These investments would then go toward U.S. businesses that create products in fields including clean energy, cars, medicine, biotechnology, telecommunication and artificial intelligence.

The Biden campaign says the effort would generate 5 million jobs.

Biden also calls for the need to diversify the manufacturing and innovation industries by providing ""historic investments"" in communities of color as well as in cities and rural locations.

The Democratic nominee supports a $15 minimum wage, universal paid sick leave and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.

Biden also wants to do away with the Republican corporate tax cuts passed in 2017, vowing to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. It's part of his $4 trillion tax package that his campaign says wouldn't directly raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000.

Trump's Plans For The Economy

Trump touts the country's pre-pandemic economy, saying he's the candidate to get it back out of its deep hole.

In a list of agenda items for a second term, released in August, Trump's campaign said his priorities include creating 10 million jobs in 10 months and creating 1 million small businesses.

He supports enacting additional tax cuts and the expansion of the ""opportunity zones"" tax break, though he gives no estimate of by how much.

Echoing goals set during his first campaign and term in office, Trump calls for tax credits to businesses making American products. And he says he will continue to enact ""fair trade deals that protect American jobs"" and cut back on business regulations.

As part of his agenda on China, Trump wants to establish 1 million domestic jobs that were previously based in China and offer tax breaks for businesses to move jobs out of China and back to the U.S., focusing specifically on pharmaceutical and robotics companies that currently outsource jobs.

There are no details about these plans, apart from their inclusion on the agenda list.

The White House says it will not give federal contracts to companies that continue to manufacture products in China. The president signed an executive order in August that incentivizes federal agencies to domestically source their jobs instead of outsourcing them. Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at boosting domestic production, but critics say that loopholes have allowed government agencies to circumvent these ""made in America"" provisions.

The event, which took place in Wilmington, Delaware, was perhaps overshadowed by the alarming rise in COVID-19 cases across the country, and by Donald Trump’s continued refusal to accept the election result. But Biden managed to make news by warning that more Americans may die if Trump doesn’t provide more coöperation to his transition team working on the coronavirus crisis. “We are going into a very dark winter,” the President-elect said. “Things are going to get much tougher before they get easier”

Biden was referring to the pandemic, but his remarks also apply to the economy, the fate of which is inextricably tied to the virus. In the short term, the economic prognosis is grim. As states introduce new restrictions on businesses—California, on Monday, announced that it was “pulling the emergency brake” on its reopening—there may well be another round of furloughs and layoffs. And this is happening at a time when many of the pandemic-support programs that Congress introduced in March are coming to an end. The federal extension of unemployment benefits to thirty-nine weeks, for example, and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which allowed gig workers to receive jobless benefits for the first time, will both expire at the end of next month. The deadline for new applications to the Paycheck Protection Program, which pays small businesses to keep workers on their payrolls, has already passed.

Biden pointed out that these coronavirus-relief programs are “keeping Americans afloat.” Extending them and providing more financial assistance to states and municipalities that have seen their tax revenues plummet in 2020 is not only the just thing to do: it would prevent further damage to the economy in the form of business failures, job losses, and insolvencies. Looking further ahead, Biden also outlined elements of the “Build Back Better” plan that he put forward during the campaign. He did not, however, dwell on the longer-term macroeconomic environment that his Administration will face, which, following the positive news from Pfizer and Moderna about the results of their vaccine trials, has become a hot topic of debate among economists.

As always, there are a range of views. During an interview with the Brookings Institution’s Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy on Monday, Richard Clarida, a former Columbia University economist who is the vice-chair of the Federal Reserve Board, laid out an optimistic scenario, in which the lifting of restrictions on travel and other activities generates an outpouring of demand. “There is an enormous quantity of pent-up saving,” Clarida said, pointing to estimates that American households have built up more than a trillion dollars in extra savings. “That is the only time in my professional career when disposable income actually went up in a deep recession. And a lot of that has been saved, a lot of that has been forcibly saved, because people haven’t necessarily been able to go out and spend all of that.” In their latest public projections, Clarida and his colleagues on the Fed’s policymaking committee predicted that G.D.P. would expand by four per cent in 2021 and that the unemployment rate, which is currently at 6.9 per cent, would fall to 5.5 per cent by the fourth quarter of next year. That would represent a decent recovery. But, in his interview, Clarida pointed to the possibility of even stronger economic outcomes, including some “very, very attractive” ones. “And obviously,” he added, “the odds of that have gone up relative to where we were before the vaccine news.”

Clarida’s comments jibed with the arguments of other optimists, on Wall Street and elsewhere. In a recent note about the prospects for 2021, the economics team at Goldman Sachs said that mass immunization and the removal of coronavirus restrictions “should fuel a mid-year consumption boom as restored opportunities to spend allow households to substantially lower their saving rates and spend accumulated excess savings.” One of the most upbeat economists is Tim Duy, a University of Oregon professor and Bloomberg contributor. In his most recent column, Duy cited the vaccine and pent-up savings as positive factors, and he also mentioned several other things that could boost growth going forward, including favorable demographics. Biden, Duy wrote, is “stepping into a dream scenario for economic growth on the other side of the battle with the Covid-19 pandemic.”

The sanguine analysis could turn out to be accurate, but other policymakers and economists emphasize a number of reasons for tempering our optimism. For one thing, it’s still unclear when a vaccine will be widely available. “Even in the best case, widespread vaccination is months into the future,” Jerome Powell, Clarida’s boss at the Fed, said in an online Q. & A. session on Tuesday. Secondly, although the optimists are surely right when they say that a vaccine will boost spending and growth, the magnitude and durability of this effect is hard to predict. Even as optimism rises, businesses from airlines to hotels to theme parks are warning that it could take years for activity in their industries to return to pre-pandemic levels. Some policymakers are issuing similar warnings. “The ascent out of this calamity is likely to be long, uneven, and highly uncertain,” Gita Gopinath, the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, wrote in a blog post last month.

The task ahead is a large one. Despite the recent rebound in growth and employment, the over-all number of jobs in the U.S. economy is still about ten million below where it stood in February. The recent drop in the unemployment rate, which now stands at 6.9 per cent, has been accentuated, in part, by a drop in the workforce-participation rate, as many workers, particularly women, have stopped working to take care of their families. Moreover, the economic rebound was contingent on the huge and unprecedented fiscal stimulus—equivalent to more than ten per cent of G.D.P.—which is now running out. If a Republican-controlled Senate refuses to authorize more stimulus spending in the lame-duck session, and when the new Congress meets in January, then hopes for a post-pandemic boom could fade pretty rapidly.

Economists close to Biden are well aware of this danger. “We have to have fiscal policy, structural policy, other than just relying on central banks to achieve healthy growth,” Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Fed, who is reportedly being considered for the post of Treasury Secretary in the new Administration, said at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, on Monday. At one point in October, the Trump White House indicated that it would support a new coronavirus-spending bill worth $1.9 trillion—roughly the same magnitude as the CARES Act, which was valued at $2.2 trillion. McConnell and his Republican colleagues dismissed this effort out of hand and proposed a “skinny” coronavirus-relief bill worth five hundred billion dollars. Last week, McConnell indicated that a bigger, broader spending bill is still off the table. Since then, there has been no progress. “Congress appeared nowhere close to passing another coronavirus relief bill . . . as infections surge across the country and new public health restrictions threaten businesses and jobs,” CNBC reported, on Tuesday."

By 2050, GDP increases by 1.7 percent in 2050 relative to current law while GDP per capita stays the same.

Macroeconomic effects of Biden’s immigration policy

Introduction

In recent years, immigration has fallen to historically low levels with new immigrants representing 0.54 percent of the U.S. population in 2017 and 0.37 percent in 2018, compared to an average of 0.61 percent for the two decades prior. Without any policy change, we project that immigration rates continue at their current lower level and slowly return to historical levels by 2050. Following our previous comprehensive analysis of presidential candidate Joe Biden’s platform, this analysis presents more detailed economic estimates of the Biden immigration policy proposal.

Biden’s Plan

Biden’s plan has many elements, some of which do not directly affect fiscal analysis or do not have enough details provided by the campaign. We focus this analysis on two major channels in Biden’s plan with potentially large macroeconomic consequences: a transition to legal status of unauthorized migrants and restoring immigration rates to their pre-Trump era averages.

Method

We model Biden’s plan for a transition to legal status based on the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which is referenced in the campaign’s immigration plan. This bill outlined a 10-year transition to lawful permanent resident status for unauthorized immigrants, including immediate work permits to transition them to full legal status. Drawing on a CBO analysis of the 2013 bill, S. 744, we estimate that two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants would gain legal status. We model Biden’s plan to restore immigration rates as immediate, thereby returning immigration back to historical rates.

Demographic Projections

The main demographic effect of granting legal status to most unauthorized immigrants is a decrease in emigration rates, as authorized immigrants emigrate back to their country less often than unauthorized immigrants. We project that the Biden immigration plan would increase the U.S. population by 1.64 percent in 2050, thereby increasing total labor supply. U.S. fertility increases since immigrants have more children than native-born families, and this increase, in turn, produces downstream demographic and economic effects such as a slightly younger population. This effect peaks in 2040, when the percentage of the population that is of prime working age (20 to 64 years) increases from 70.00 percent under current law to 70.26 percent under the Biden immigration plan.

Macroeconomic Projections

In Table 1, we present estimated changes for various economic aggregates relative to a current law baseline. Because of the sharp increase in labor supply during the initial years, GDP increases by 1 percent in 2030. New immigrants in the model are assumed to bring very little savings into the U.S. economy, which translates to a smaller increase in the capital stock relative to labor. Because of this lower initial savings, immigrants work more in order to save wealth for later consumption.

Since labor is more abundant than capital under the Biden policy scenario, wages are initially lower, decreasing on average by 0.3 percent in 2030. Capital returns increase slightly, which provides incentive for domestic savers and foreign investors to provide capital at a higher rate than in the baseline. This effect along with the increased work hours of immigrants brings capital closer to balance with labor by 2050, with increases of 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. As capital accumulates, wages increase and approach baseline scenario wages by 2050.

Higher GDP combined with a larger capital stock leads to higher tax revenues. Spending does not increase proportionally with increased immigration because immigrants are of working age, do not collect Social Security old age benefits, and do not access transfer programs disproportionately. By 2050, smaller budget deficits resulting from increased revenues decrease government debt by 1.6 percent relative to the current law baseline.

Table 1. Economic Effects of the Biden Immigration Plan Percent change relative to baseline DOWNLOAD DATA Year GDP Capital stock Hours worked Average hourly wage Debt Held by the Public 2030 1.0% 0.6% 1.3% -0.3% 0.0% 2040 1.5% 1.4% 1.7% -0.2% -1.0% 2050 1.7% 1.7% 1.8% -0.1% -1.6%

Since population size differs between the baseline and policy scenarios, it is useful to see changes on a per capita basis as shown in Table 2. As discussed above, new immigrants have little savings and hours worked per capita increase even in the face of a decrease in the average hourly wage. The 0.4 percent drop in capital stock per capita in 2030 results from slower capital adjustment, as capital accumulation does not immediately follow the growth in hours worked. Since the economy is partially open, foreign investment flows cannot immediately address a capital shortfall. By 2050, the shortfall in capital disappears, with capital per capita increasing by 0.1 percent and hours worked per capita increasing by 0.1 percent. In addition to the decline in total debt discussed above, a larger population directly lowers the per capita debt because the amount of debt is divided by a larger total population.

On Wednesday, Biden pushed tax proposals that he said would help bring jobs back to the United States, trying to hit Trump on an issue the Republican campaigned on four years ago. And on Friday, Biden assailed Trump’s handling of the economy, saying Trump’s agenda benefits the wealthy and few others, leveling a populist attack at the incumbent.

“Those at the top are seeing things go up, and those at the middle or below or seeing things go down or get worse,” Biden said Friday in his first big speech on the economy in weeks. “We all know it didn’t have to be this bad. It didn’t have to be this bad if the president just did his job.”

Trump for months has acted as if he had a clear edge over his eventual Democratic rival on the economy, promising a financial collapse if Biden were to win in November. For much of the summer, polls showed a solid lead for Trump on the economy. But there are signs that Trump’s advantage might be softening.

Senior Biden campaign officials cheered a CNN poll conducted Aug. 28-Sept. 1 that showed Trump polling 49 percent on the economy and Biden 48 percent. It is a significant narrowing from CNN’s Aug. 12-15 poll that found Trump leading Biden on the economy 53 percent to 45 percent.

Other nationwide polls show a similar closing of the gap on this key issue. A CBS-YouGov poll from Sept. 2-4 shows Trump at 45 percent on the economy and Biden at 44 percent. And a Quinnipiac poll conducted Aug. 28-31 showed the two candidates neck-and-neck on the economy, with both at 48 percent.

Few polls ask consistently about who voters think can best steer the economy, making it difficult to assess how durable Biden’s apparent gains on the issue are. Some swing state polls still show voters giving Trump a clear edge on money matters. An NBC News/Marist poll in Pennsylvania conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 7 still found Trump leading on the economy, 51 percent to Biden’s 41 percent. It was a similar story in Florida, with Trump leading 53 percent to Biden’s 40 percent on the economy.

This apparent shift comes as oil prices have slumped in recent days and the stock market showed new signs of turbulence. These could be indicators that Wall Street fears a rough patch ahead for the recovery. Federal Reserve Chief Jerome H. Powell, a Trump nominee, warned Friday that the recovery “will get harder from here.” Coronavirus cases are also expected to increase again in the fall, further imperiling the economy.

The U.S. economy is basically half recovered from the deep pandemic recession that began seven months ago. Trump paints this as a glass-half-full scenario. The rebound, especially for jobs and the stock market, has been swifter than most experts expected, and Trump argues that the momentum will continue under his leadership but flounder under his rival’s. Trump is also likely to get highly favorable government reports on jobs and economic growth just before the election.

Biden has said, however, that the country’s nearly 14 million unemployed deserve more from the White House than Trump has delivered.

As Biden has attacked Trump on the economy, Trump has tried to hit back hard.

On Monday, the president said the economy will “crash” if Biden is elected.

And on Tuesday, he said in Florida that “we’re rapidly restoring the greatest economy in history. Joe Biden’s plan would destroy America’s middle class.”

Whether Biden can put a material dent in Trump’s standing on the economy is likely to be critical to the election in swing states. Hillary Clinton led Trump overall in the polls and on most issues in 2016, except for the economy. No president has won reelection in modern history with the unemployment rate above 7.2 percent. As of August, the unemployment rate was 8.4 percent, but it is likely to fall further by Election Day.

“Concerns about the economy are rising. Pennsylvania voters said covid was the biggest issue in July. Now it’s the economy,” said Berwood Yost, the director of the Center for Opinion Research at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.

The pandemic, the falling stock market in recent days and the fact there are 237,000 fewer manufacturing jobs now than when Trump took office add further pressure on Trump and present an opening for Biden. But the Democratic nominee has to get voters to buy into a different future and vision for the economy.

Biden has hundreds of pages of policy outlines on his website. His economic slogan is “Build Back Better,” and the plan largely boils down to this: Go big on infrastructure, invest in modern manufacturing jobs, and make it easier for Americans to work by expanding sick pay, parental leave and affordable child care and elder care for all employees. He envisions a future of cleaner energy and technology — a blue-collar-plus message for the key swing states.

On Wednesday in Michigan, Biden unveiled a 10 percent tax to penalize companies that move jobs abroad and then try to sell goods back into the United States, his latest attempt to undercut Trump among working-class voters who fear their jobs are going to Mexico and China. Biden has tried to walk a fine line between centrist Democrats and the progressive wing of the party. He has tried to appear pragmatic and flexible, which some view as a strength in building a wide coalition but others see as a problem because people wonder what he really stands for.

“I believe Biden is a good statesperson, much more diplomatic — but specifically as to what he says about the economy, I don’t really have anything that comes to my mind,” said Shawn Reilly, the mayor of Waukesha, Wis. Reilly said he usually votes Republican but sat out the 2016 election and is on the fence about Biden.

A number of people say Biden needs to be clearer about his economic plans, noting that Trump’s priorities may be more immediately discernible to voters in their clarity. Trump didn’t bother with a policy platform at this year’s Republican National Convention, a first for the Republican Party since the 1856 election. His economic plan is well known to voters. It’s a continuation of what he’s done in the past four years: more tax cuts, more trade tariffs on China and other nations, and more deregulation.

“We need to know what Biden’s going to do,” said Nell McCormack Abom, who led media relations for Republican Tom Ridge when he was governor of Pennsylvania. Ridge is in touch with many Republicans and independents who are not thrilled with Trump but are on the fence about Biden.

The president keeps portraying the pre-coronavirus economy as the “greatest in history,” a claim that fact-checkers are quick to debunk since growth was far higher under Presidents Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Lyndon Johnson, and was only slightly better before the pandemic than in President Barack Obama’s second term. Still, Americans rated the economy in early 2020 as the best since the late 1990s.

Trump’s advisers are encouraged that many voters aren’t blaming Trump for the pandemic recession. Trump has repeatedly sought to dodge blame for the current downturn by pinning it on the “China virus.”

“If you’re a normal president with this unemployment, you’d be in trouble. But people get that this is a consequence of the pandemic, and instead of blaming Trump they think, ‘Who can help us?’ ” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and Trump ally. “It’s easy for Trump because he can point to a memory that’s relatively recent. It’s a lot harder for Biden.”

Biden keeps stressing the need for a more equitable economy. His tax plan would fall largely on the rich, whom he defines as Americans earning more than $400,000 a year. Some liberals criticize Biden as not going far enough, especially in his plans to close the economic gap between Blacks and Whites. They want him embrace reparations that provide money to the descendants of those who were enslaved in the United States. Biden has instead called for more aid for Black entrepreneurs and an expansion of tax and home-buying credits to boost Black wealth.

“Getting back to normal is insufficient. You have to build back better,” said Jared Bernstein, who served as chief economist to Biden during Biden’s vice-presidency. “People from low-income families, Native American families, people of color must finally have a chance to realize their potential in this economy.”

Beyond personality and leadership style, some of the deepest divisions between Trump and Biden are playing out over taxes and energy policy. Trump has called generally for more tax cuts for the middle class and for special tax cuts that would mostly benefit the wealthy. Biden has said he would keep the latest tax cuts in place for the middle class but would raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent and reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the richest Americans.

On energy, Trump is trying to woo voters in Pennsylvania by painting Biden as against coal and natural gas. In his convention speech, Trump said Biden “has promised to abolish production of American oil, coal, shale and natural gas.” Biden has not called for an end to fracking, the process used in much of the United States to extract shale oil and natural gas.

In Wisconsin, pollsters say Trump may be vulnerable in the state because of the electronics maker Foxconn, the company involved in a deal he said would bring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the state. Foxconn scrapped plans for a big factory in Wisconsin in 2019, and most of the jobs originally envisioned are not expected ever to materialize. Many voters still bring up the subject unprompted during focus groups and polling.

“We’ve done several hundred deep, qualitative interviews with voters. Foxconn is one of things they bring up. They see it not bringing jobs to Wisconsin and un-American because the company is foreign,” said Michael W. Wagner, a professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

The Trump team points to an economy that is strengthening and could be even better by Election Day. While there is still a lot of economic hardship, especially among the jobless, manufacturing and consumer spending are showing signs of rebounding. A lot of economic data has been better than expected in August and September, and third-quarter growth is expected to show a huge rebound — over 20 percent — with the reopening of many businesses."
12,USC poll: Biden leads on everything but jobs and the economy - USC News,USC poll: Biden leads on everything but jobs and the economy  USC News,"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51c2MuZWR1L3VzYy1kYXlicmVhay1wb2xsLWJpZGVuLXRydW1wLWpvYnMtZWNvbm9teS1mYXZvcmFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,USC News,"One-third of all registered voters say jobs and the economy is their most important issue in deciding which presidential candidate to vote for, the latest USC Dornsife Daybreak Poll shows.

When asked which candidate they trust more to handle jobs and the economy, registered voters give President Donald Trump a 4 percentage-point advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden. But on uniting the country and healing racial divisions and on COVID-19 response, Biden has an advantage of 22 points and 14 points, respectively.

The poll also found that nearly 3 out of 5 voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump; nearly half have an extremely unfavorable opinion. Voters are more evenly split over Biden: Half rated him either somewhat favorable or extremely favorable and 47% rated him unfavorably, including more than a third who have an extremely unfavorable opinion.

Voters were asked if they feel discomfort in discussing their choice of presidential candidates with family, friends, acquaintances and pollsters, an issue that was significantly associated with late deciders for Trump in the 2016 Daybreak Poll. Pollsters found very little difference in the comfort levels of Trump and Biden voters.

In 2016, the Daybreak Poll found Trump voters to be significantly less comfortable with discussing their candidate choice than Hillary Clinton voters, particularly among acquaintances and if contacted by a telephone poll, said Jill Darling, survey director of the Daybreak Poll. This year, we see very little difference between Trump voters and Biden voters. The undecided voters are more reticent, but very few voters remain truly undecided.

The national probability poll was conducted by the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research among 4,580 registered voters who are members of its Understanding America Study panel. The poll has an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

Partisan differences in how voters ranked issues tell a more nuanced story

Half of Republican voters and those who say theyre voting for Trump, along with just under half the voters who lean toward voting Republican, chose jobs and the economy as their top issue.

In contrast, Democrats were more divided on their top issue. Uniting the country and healing racial divisions was chosen by a third of those identifying as Democrats and Biden voters, and by just under a quarter of those who lean Democrat. That issue ranked second among all registered voters, as well as among GOP leaners, independents and undecided voters.

People are sharply divided on lines of partisanship, not only about what candidate they favor but on what issues are most important to them, said Robert Shrum, director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future.

Law enforcement and criminal justice was picked second most often by Trump voters and Republicans in general. The Trump campaigns focus on riots and protests as problems in the cities are resonating among Trump voters and Republicans, Darling said. However, potential swing voters are more concerned about uniting the country around racial unrest.

In contrast, immigration  which dominated the 2016 presidential race headlines with Trump supporters chants to build the wall  barely registered among any category of voters as the top priority. Neither did climate change and U.S.-China relations.

People are sharply divided on lines of partisanship, not only about what candidate they favor but on what issues are most important to them. Robert Shrum

The poll was conducted before Trump visited California, where massive wildfires have magnified the issue of climate change.

Although jobs and the economy took the top spot among all registered voters and among Republicans and Trump voters, uniting the country was the top issue for nearly 1 in 5 voters who lean Republican, and a similar percentage of independents and undecided voters.

The poll results reveal that Biden has an issue that everybody, including Republicans, cares about: uniting and healing, said Mike Murphy, co-director of the Center for the Political Future. Its a very clear roadmap for Biden. If he can make it more germane and move it further up the importance scale, thats pure gain for him.

Its (not just) the economy, stupid

Pollsters also asked voters who they trusted more to deal with these issues. While voters gave Trump the edge by 4 percentage points on jobs and economy, they trusted Biden more on all of the other issues  many of them by double-digit margins.

Its clear that Biden owns uniting and healing  as well as climate change  for the small percentage of people who chose that as their most important issue, said Darling. But he also has a 10-point advantage on health care  an issue that ranked high in importance for swing voters.

Whats amazing to me about this poll is Trump’s lead on the economy has steadily eroded, said Shrum. And the president is campaigning heavily on law enforcement and criminal justice  an issue where Biden actually has a four-point advantage.

Favorability ratings and voter motivation

Results show that nearly half of all registered voters (47%) have an extremely unfavorable opinion of Trump, compared to one third who have an extremely unfavorable opinion of Biden.

Biden has an overall favorable impression among half of the voters, while only 40% of voters have a somewhat or extremely favorable opinion of Trump.

Independents have a net negative impression of both candidates, by similar margins, but they are four times as likely to say they havent heard enough about Biden to form an opinion.

On a related issue, Biden voters were more likely than Trump voters to say their choice was motivated by opposition to the other candidate. Among Biden voters, 53% say they are supporting their candidate, while 47% say they are voting mainly to oppose Trump.

Trump continues to be the unwitting get-out-the-vote machine for Democrats, Shrum said.

A much larger majority of Trump voters are voting for him: 85% say they are supporting their candidate and only 15% are voting mainly against Biden.

13,"The Nightmare Pandemic Economy Joe Biden Is Inheriting, in 5 Charts - TIME","The Nightmare Pandemic Economy Joe Biden Is Inheriting, in 5 Charts  TIME","Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNTkxMTcyMy9iaWRlbi1lY29ub215LXBhbmRlbWljL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,TIME,"By Emily Barone

When President-elect Joe Biden steps into White House in January, he will inherit two inextricably linked crises: The worsening COVID-19 pandemic and a wide-reaching recession. As U.S. coronavirus cases are spiking to all-time highs, he will be responsible for keeping Americans safe while guiding a fragile economy through recovery.

That’s a tall order—and a somewhat paradoxical one. A fully open economy will most certainly lead to more viral spread and likely result in more deaths, while a closed economy could contain the virus but bring about even more financial hardship. And as the weather cools and fewer people want to dine, drink or otherwise spend time outside, it will become even harder to find the right mix of policies to both curb spread and keep businesses (and their employees) afloat.

Biden has already demonstrated a more hands-on approach to the pandemic than U.S. President Donald Trump. In his first order of business after being projected the winner, the President-elect established a COVID-19 advisory board to guide his thinking and work with state and local health officials. The group, Biden’s transition team says, will develop public-health strategies based on scientific information to “reopen our schools and businesses safely and effectively,” among other goals.

Still, the task at hand will be difficult, to say the least. The following five charts show what Biden and his Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris, are up against as they prepare to take the oaths of office.

1. Americans don’t agree on the best course of action

The coronavirus has affected almost every country around the world. Many have taken an economic hit this year as a result. However, while citizens of other countries generally agree on how to move forward, Americans have a wide ideological divide that could make Biden’s job much harder, as presidents often draw on public support to help push their agendas forward.

A Pew survey conducted over the summer found that, among citizens of economically advanced countries struggling to contain the virus, Americans were the most polarized along party lines in their assessment of their government’s response to the virus and the economy. Furthermore, another Pew poll from October revealed that only 24% of Trump supporters said the coronavirus outbreak was very important to their vote, compared with 82% of Biden supporters. Conversely, 84% of Trump supporters said the economy was very important, versus 66% of Biden supporters.

Biden has pledged to follow the advice of public-health advisors, even if they recommend shutting down businesses. Biden’s supporters may applaud that approach, but he will find it challenging to convince the rest of the country it’s the right way to go—especially Trump’s most ardent loyalists, many of whom have shunned even basic preventative measures, like masks.

2. Lawmakers don’t agree, either

Election Day resulted in a narrower Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, while two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia will determine whether the Senate remains narrowly in Republican control or gets split down the middle, with Harris casting a tie-breaking vote when necessary.

Either way, the congressional situation is a major obstacle for Biden’s agenda, writes TIME’s Abby Vesoulis. As she notes, the President-elect may get only parts of his broad plans—spanning everything from childcare to infrastructure to climate change—through a gridlocked Congress.

On the coronavirus front, Biden has called for federal relief programs—including loans for small businesses, direct payments to working families and student loan forgiveness—to serve as a financial bridge until the virus is under control. He has also proposed employing tens of thousands of COVID-19 contact tracers as a means of both curbing viral spread and chipping away at the high unemployment rate.

Federal relief programs are not new for Biden, who, as vice president to Barack Obama during the height of the Great Recession, helped shepherd a $787 billion stimulus package through Congress in 2009. But back then, he had the benefit of a significant Democratic majority in both chambers, making it easier to put the Obama Administration’s goals into practice.

3. The unemployment crisis is worse than it seems

The overall U.S. unemployment rate is currently 6.9%, which, while better than April’s 14.7%, still means that 10 million pre-pandemic jobs remain M.I.A., according to Nov. 6 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Economists have said that the jobs that haven’t returned by this point will be the hardest to claw back, in part because they are concentrated in the industries most affected by virus containment measures, like leisure, travel and hospitality.

The Trump-era employment gains may not continue at the same pace under Biden, because prolonged unemployment, especially in a weak labor market, can be harder to fix. People who have been unemployed for six months or more are about twice as likely to drop out of the labor force as to find employment, according to a U.S. Federal Reserve analysis of unemployment trends during the Great Recession. Additionally, the longer a person is out of work, the less consumer purchasing they do, which further slows economic growth.

Alarming BLS data show that long-term unemployment as a share of all unemployment is growing fast. In October, 3.6 million of the 11 million unemployed Americans—or one in three—had been out of work for six months or longer. That’s a ratio not seen since mid-2014, when Biden was VP and the unemployment rate, like today, topped 6%.

The continuing unemployment crisis has led economists to become increasingly pessimistic about when the country might return to pre-pandemic levels. Business and academic economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal in April predicted the labor market would recover by 2022. But when surveyed again in October, 55% had extended their recovery forecast to 2023 or later.

4. Biden can’t fix the coronavirus or the economy without addressing systemic racism

2020 brought the country’s ongoing struggle with racism to the fore, as police brutality and other forms of violence against Black people led to nationwide Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrations. But systemic racism hasn’t been on display just in horrifying viral videos—it has also been apparent as COVID-19 ravaged Black communities in particular.

Systemic racism has made it harder for Black communities to achieve the wealth, access to health care and overall prosperity that white communities enjoy. As a result, Black people in the U.S. are most vulnerable to the virus itself, as well as the economic disruptions it has brought on. A disproportionate share of Black Americans have fallen severely ill from the virus. They are more likely to hold lower-wage, public-facing, front-line worker positions that put them at greater risk of exposure. And they are less likely to have accumulated savings to pay the bills if their jobs disappear. Addressing the pandemic’s health and economic effects requires acknowledging these facts, and acting accordingly.

5. We’re not out of this yet

On Nov. 9, pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced promising results from its vaccine effectiveness trials; other companies are also in late-stage trials. The stock market surged on the news, as investors predicted that the vaccine will suppress case rates and therefore expedite economic recovery.

But that won’t happen immediately, even if the vaccine is highly effective in a biological sense. Public-health strategies will continue to be critical during the time it will take to produce, distribute and widely administer a vaccine. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is planning a phased rollout starting with high-risk populations, is anticipating that a limited number of doses will be available at first. If the rollout happens as quickly as President Trump has touted, mass vaccination could take Biden’s entire first term.

Another obstacle: for a vaccine to work, people need to actually receive it—but survey data suggest that many Americans aren’t on board. The chart below, adapted from STAT and The Harris Poll, shows that only about 58% of Americans surveyed in October plan to get a vaccine as soon as one is available—down from 69% in August. The hesitancy is even more pronounced among Black Americans, with only 43% reportedly planning to get vaccinated right away.

It’s hard to say how effective Biden will be in balancing public-health measures with the economic consequences of viral containment. Other countries have shown such a balancing is possible—Germany, South Korea and Japan, for instance, have experienced fewer deaths per capita and less severe economic losses than the U.S., as measured by gross domestic product declines since late 2019.

But it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Other nations benefit from a stronger consensus among citizens on the best path forward. Moreover, some have social safety nets that cushion the blows from economic disruptions. And not all countries have the added complication of deep-seated racism that has disproportionately affected minority communities in the U.S.

Still, Biden believes the government needs to do better, and he campaigned on the promise of finding middle ground. In the last pre-election debate, he suggested that health and economic goals are not necessarily in competition—that if the nation is healthy, then the economy will be, too. His challenge now will be channeling that idea into effective policy. Given that states, rather than the national government, have the most power to issue and enforce public-health rules, expect him to start by working with—or, in some cases, perhaps even pressuring—the country’s governors to follow his lead."

The Nov. 3 election between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden will give American voters a choice between two candidates with drastically different views of the world and divergent approaches to tackling some of the biggest issues facing the country. Here is a detailed look at their policies and proposals in seven key areas.

Economy The coronavirus pandemic put tens of millions of Americans out of work, ended the longest U.S. economic recovery on record and undermined a key argument for President Donald Trump’s re-election.

Reopening the economy Cautious Cautioned against reopening without ramping up testing. Yes Pushed states to reopen as quickly as possible, even as infections spiked.

Putting the economy back on track Trillions more Has proposed spending trillions to create new jobs in clean energy, manufacturing and caregiving, and to ease racial economic inequality. Wants Washington to offer states more support in paying for unemployment benefits and says households - as well as local governments - need more support to get through the shutdown. Onetime stimulus Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Trump has signed legislation to flush the economy with trillions of dollars in onetime aid to businesses, individuals and local governments. Hasn’t stood behind a fresh round of stimulus measures, and called for federal funding to be cut to cities and states that don’t crack down on protesters. Supports deferring payroll taxes for a temporary boost to paychecks.

Taxes and wages Raise minimum wage Has criticized the Trump administration’s 2017 tax cuts as giving too many benefits to the wealthy and corporations. Pledges to reverse some of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts by raising the marginal tax rate on the highest income earners back to 39.6% from 37%. Supports raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25 and expanding some tax credits for lower-income workers. No to raising taxes Touts his 2017 tax cuts as an example of his approach to stimulating economic growth. Deferring payroll taxes would temporarily boost paychecks of most working Americans. The Trump campaign is attacking the policy of raising taxes while the economy struggles to recover and the deficit rises.

Trade Boost domestic manufacturing Proposed his own made-in-America manufacturing plan in July. He pledged to spend $700 billion on American-made products and industrial research, which he said would give at least 5 million more people a paycheck during a job-killing pandemic. Criticizes Trump’s tariff war with China as bad for U.S. consumers and farmers. Voted for NAFTA as a senator. Boost domestic manufacturing In a return to a core issue of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump is telling voters he wants to boost domestic manufacturing. Says America’s difficulties in procuring medical supplies internationally during the pandemic are another reason to encourage U.S. companies to avoid offshoring.

Green investments $2 trillion over four years Said he would spend $2 trillion over four years to improve infrastructure, create zero-emissions public transportation, build sustainable homes and create clean-energy jobs. Little appetite Advocates more spending on U.S. roads, bridges and airports, too, but has signaled little appetite for making “green” investments.

COVID-19 The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 220,000 Americans and infected nearly 9 million people in the country. The Trump administration has allocated tens of billions of dollars to develop vaccines and therapies, expand testing and buy protective gear. It has mostly called upon state officials to deploy the funds and create their own strategies and plans to bring down infection rates and deaths.

Enforce mask wearing Yes Has said he will push for mandatory mask-wearing across the country through orders by governors and mayors, and by asking Americans to wear them when they are with people outside their households. Has set an example by wearing masks at events throughout his campaign. No Has left it up to states and localities to set their own mask policies and said Americans can wear them voluntarily. Has not pushed mask wearing at the White House or campaign rallies. Has largely dismissed masks, saying “maybe they’re great” but also “maybe they’re not so good.”

Vaccine development Yes Says will invest $25 billion in manufacturing and distribution to get the vaccine to every American, at no cost. Emphasizes that he will trust scientists to decide on vaccine safety and efficacy, that clinical data be released, and ensure that researchers can report on and testify to Congress on the vaccine. Yes Has committed more than $10 billion to accelerate vaccine development and purchase hundreds of millions of doses, promising to make vaccines free. Set expectations high for a vaccine before the election and accused U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists of holding up the process for political reasons.

Testing strategy Coordinated response Advocates for a coordinated response between the federal government and states that would include at least 10 mobile testing sites and drive-through facilities per state. Says he will set up a Pandemic Testing Board to increase the production and distribution of tests, and make tests free. Also wants to build a national contract tracing workforce. States in charge Allocated $26 billion to testing and contact tracing, of which about $11 billion went to states and tribal communities. Set up dozens of drive-through testing locations, but most were shut down by June, saying the testing funds provided to states are enough. Provided supplemental testing sites to some COVID-19 “hot spots.” About 1 million COVID-19 diagnostic tests are now conducted daily, compared with a target of nearly 6 million tests per day.

Race and criminal justice Trump and Biden have contrasting views and records on criminal justice and the U.S. racial divide, issues that have risen in prominence in the 2020 election.

Diversity and inclusion Promises diversity Has pledged that his Cabinet, judicial appointments and running mate will reflect the country’s diversity. Few Black advisers Has very few Black Americans among his advisers and White House staff.

Policing Reform qualified immunity Has accused the Trump administration of lax oversight of police departments accused of civil rights violations. Supports reforming qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields officers from victims’ lawsuits. Trump’s spokeswoman has said he would not support ending that immunity. Has resisted activist calls to “defund the police,” instead promising to invest $300 million in a program that gives grants to hire more diverse officers and train them to develop less adversarial relationships with communities. “Law and order” Responded to the nationwide protests over the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody by urging a militaristic response. Signed an executive order to take steps toward police reform. It encourages police to use the latest standards for use of force, banning chokeholds unless an officer’s life was in danger, and called for legislation to do more. Democrats faulted the order for allowing some exceptions to the chokehold ban and placing no restrictions on warrants that let police enter a suspect’s property without knocking.

Criminal justice reform Yes Wants to eliminate the death penalty, solitary confinement and jailing accused criminals until they pay a cash bail. Has pledged $20 billion in grants for states to reduce social ills like illiteracy and child abuse in exchange for scaling back mandatory-minimum sentences. As a senator, Biden voted for a 1994 crime bill that critics see contributing to the mass incarceration of Black Americans. Yes In 2018 signed into law the First Step Act, a bipartisan measure reducing mandatory-minimum sentences, expanding drug treatment programs for prisoners and allowing some prisoners to finish their sentences early with good behavior. Has also supported some “tough-on-crime” policies that disproportionately affect minorities, including seeking to restart executions of federal death row inmates.

Addressing racial economic disparities Yes Calls for laws making it easier to sue over wage discrimination. Says will create new fair-lending and fair-housing protections, provide $300 million in grants to cities that reduce discriminatory zoning regulations and create a task force to address the disproportionate deaths of Black people from COVID-19. Says he would have a group study the feasibility of paying cash reparations to Black people as a result of slavery and segregation. Economic growth for all Often touts Black unemployment rate, which hit the lowest levels on record before the coronavirus pandemic, when talking about his policies on race. Has offered few targeted policy proposals to recover the jobs lost since then.

Support for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) Yes Plans to make public colleges and universities tuition-free to most students would apply to public HBCUs. He would also invest more than $70 billion in the schools to start research institutes and for tuition support. Yes Signed a law that the White House said made $255 million in funding for HBCUs permanent and increased money for the federal Pell Grant program. The administration also touts a relaunched HBCU Capital Finance Board, legislation adding money for scholarships and research at HBCUs.

Healthcare Healthcare was already a top concern among U.S. voters even before the coronavirus pandemic killed more than 200,000 Americans. The crisis is likely to shine an even brighter spotlight on the vast differences on healthcare policy between the two candidates.

Obamacare Yes Has vowed to bolster the ACA. Biden’s proposed healthcare plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years and would be financed by increasing taxes on the wealthy, according to his campaign. Does not support a single-payer system like Medicare for All. Instead calls for a Medicare-like public option that would serve as an alternative, not a replacement, for private insurance. No Has used executive power and the courts to undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare, after years of failed attempts by Republican lawmakers to repeal it. Has not proposed a comprehensive replacement, despite Trump’s vow to deliver a better, less-costly healthcare system.

Lower drug prices Yes Supports a bill approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives last year that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, as private insurers do. The Trump administration has said it would veto the bill, saying it would force drug makers to spend less on research and development. Supports some form of importing prescription drugs from foreign countries to lower costs. Yes Signed an executive order to base the price of some Medicare drugs on the cost in foreign countries, where medicines tend to be cheaper, but implementation will require lengthy rulemaking that will likely be challenged in court by drugmakers. Supports some form of importing prescription drugs from foreign countries to lower costs.

Medicare/Medicaid expansion Yes Proposes lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60. Such a change would potentially extend Medicare funding to some 20 million more Americans. No Supports imposing work requirements and other limitations on Medicaid eligibility, as well as placing caps on Medicaid spending growth and converting Medicaid to block grants — all moves that experts say would result in fewer people covered.

Immigration Trump’s push to crack down on illegal immigration and reshape legal immigration was at the heart of his 2016 victory and has remained at the forefront of his White House agenda. Biden promises to rescind most of those policies and advance his own platform if he becomes the president.

Limit immigration during the COVID-19 pandemic No Has said that immigrants help grow the economy and create jobs. Has said he would pause deportations for 100 days after taking office, but has not said if he would immediately reverse Trump’s sweeping pandemic-related restrictions. Yes Dramatically curtailed immigration and travel into the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing the steps were needed for health reasons and to protect jobs for U.S. workers. Trump has restricted the entry of many foreign workers and immigrants seeking permanent residency, and implemented a public health emergency policy that allows U.S. officials to rapidly deport migrants caught at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“Dreamers” Protect DACA Opposed Trump’s “cruel” decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects from deportation immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, popularly known as Dreamers. Biden would make Dreamers eligible for federal student aid for college and would back legislation that provides a path to citizenship for them as part of efforts to do so for all of the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, including those who did not arrive as children. End DACA The Supreme Court ruled in June against Trump’s 2017 decision to end the DACA program, calling the termination “arbitrary and capricious,” but left the administration the option to try again to end it. The Trump administration issued a memo in July that clamped down on the program, blocking new enrollment and allowing only renewals that last one year, down from the current two-year period.

The U.S.-Mexico border wall No Said in August that he would not tear down border walls built under Trump, but would stop additional construction. His plan would end the diversion of Pentagon funding to build the wall and focus instead on border enforcement like investments in improving the screening infrastructure at ports of entry. Yes The Trump administration says it has completed nearly 400 miles of border wall by late October, with a goal of 450 miles by the end of the year, but nearly all of those barriers replaced existing structures. Mexico has refused to pay for any of the construction, leaving the U.S. government to foot the bill, partially with billions of dollars in Pentagon funds. Federal court records show the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to seize land for the wall.

Family separation Reunite families Says would end the prosecution of parents for minor immigration violations, which he calls an “intimidation tactic,” and make it a priority to reunite any children still separated from their families. Separated thousands of families Trump’s 2018 “zero-tolerance” policy to prosecute illegal border crossings led to several thousand children being forcibly separated from parents and legal guardians detained on the Mexico border. The policy, described by the administration as a deterrent, sparked outrage, and the backlash led Trump to sign an executive order to end the practice. But the administration continued to separate hundreds of kids traveling with other adult relatives.

Travel ban No Promises to rescind the travel bans, calling them an abuse of power designed to discriminate against black and brown immigrants. Yes Signed an executive order banning entry to immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, a move Biden and other critics said was discriminatory. A federal court blocked the initial ban, but in 2018 the Supreme Court upheld an amended version that has since been expanded to other countries.

Climate change The election pits Biden, who plans to tie the country’s economic recovery to tackling climate change, against Trump, who is determined to remove as many regulatory hurdles to oil, gas and coal production as possible.

Climate plans Yes Proposes $2 trillion in spending over his first four-year term and aims to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035, heeding calls from his party’s progressives for a faster transition away from fossil fuels. In the last presidential debate, Biden said he would “transition from the oil industry” – he later said he was referring to a plan to kill subsidies for the fuels. Supports research into advanced nuclear energy. No Does not have a climate plan on his campaign website, but an energy and environment section highlights his administration’s rescinding of Obama-era regulations. Has rejected mainstream science on climate. In September, he refused to acknowledge any role climate change has played in deadly wildfires that swept through the U.S. West Coast. Like Biden, he supports advanced nuclear technology.

Tougher auto emissions rules Yes Wants to strengthen auto emission standards formed during the Obama administration. Proposes incentives for auto manufacturers to produce zero-emission cars, a federal procurement program for clean vehicles and set a goal for all new American-built buses to be zero-emissions by 2030. No Has called the Obama administration’s auto emission standards “industry killing,” and replaced them with weaker ones in March.

Ban on coal, fracking Cautious Has resisted a push by his party’s liberal wing to impose a nationwide ban on fracking though he proposes banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters. Fracking increases emissions of gases linked to climate change but supports jobs across the country, and has allowed the United States to become the world’s top oil and gas producer. Supports investing in coal communities by offering alternatives to mining work. No Envisions a renaissance in “beautiful clean coal,” the fuel that emits the most carbon dioxide when burned. But due to abundant natural gas and falling prices for wind and solar power, he has failed to stop coal plant shutdowns during his term in office. Also focused on protecting drilling and other fossil fuel industries, a major source of blue-collar jobs.

Climate diplomacy Yes Has said he would return the United States to a leadership role on climate change, re-entering the United States in future climate negotiations to advance the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which brought countries together to mitigate global warming. No Put in motion a process to remove the United States, the world’s No. 2 emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, from the Paris agreement, saying it was too costly.

Foreign policy Trump won the 2016 election promising to put “America First,” overturn what he said were unfair trade deals and force U.S. allies to pay more toward joint defense measures. Biden pledges to restore U.S. global leadership and reverse many of Trump’s foreign policy actions.

U.S.-China relations Global pressure on China Has called Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic a historic blunder. Argues that China relishes a chaotic Trump administration, his alienation of American allies, and his abdication of U.S. leadership roles in global institutions, such as the World Health Organization. Says he will correct this by bringing multilateral pressure to bear on China through renewed relations with U.S. allies. Stand up to Beijing Entered into a high-stakes trade war with China before reaching a partial trade deal in January. Trump has since shut the door on negotiations, saying he was unhappy with Beijing’s handling of the pandemic. In July, Trump issued an executive order to end the United States’ special commercial treatment of Hong Kong after Beijing imposed national security legislation on the former British colony, and his administration abruptly told China to close its Houston consulate amid accusations of spying.

Iran nuclear deal Yes, with conditions Says he would deal with Iran through diplomacy and re-enter the nuclear agreement, but only if Iran first returned to compliance with the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear program. No Pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal reached with Iran, European nations and Russia during the Obama administration.

U.S. military in the Middle East Yes, but with narrowed focus Proposes a narrower focus for the U.S. military in the region on counterterrorism and working with local allies. Has said the strike that killed the powerful Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani “put the United States and Iran on a collision course.” Wants to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, which Trump has defended. Mixed Has questioned the benefits of U.S. military interventions in the Middle East, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but sent more troops to the region after the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal increased tensions. In January, after Iranian proxies and U.S. forces clashed in Iraq, he ordered a strike that killed Soleimani.

Afghanistan Bring troops home Has said he will bring the vast majority of U.S. troops home from Afghanistan and narrowly focus the mission there on fighting al Qaeda and Islamic State. Full military withdrawal Has said he wants a full military withdrawal from Afghanistan to end America’s longest war, and posited that remaining troops should be “home by Christmas” – although a top adviser has said Washington would reduce its forces to 2,500 by early next year. In February, the Trump administration reached a deal with the Taliban on phased U.S. force reductions, but it was dependent on the Islamist militant group meeting conditions. Escalating violence since then has raised questions about whether Trump can bring all U.S. troops home anytime soon.

Meeting North Korea’s leader No, unless preconditions are met Biden has accused Trump of giving away U.S. leverage over the North Korean regime for little in return and said he would not meet Kim without preconditions. Yes Trump met with North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong Un three times in 2018 and 2019, but efforts to get Kim to abandon the country’s nuclear weapons program have stalled.

Alliances Yes Says will strengthen alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which Biden says would undo damage to American leadership and credibility inflicted by Trump. Has warned that Russia, China and others who try to interfere in U.S. elections will face serious consequences if he is elected president. Will revisit the issue of U.S. troops in Germany. No Has angered NATO members and other U.S. allies, while refusing to criticize Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin, even when U.S. intelligence officials concluded the Russian military had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Trump announced in June that he would reduce the number of U.S. troops in Germany by about 9,500.

Tech The regulation of big technology companies such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

Breaking up Big Tech Maybe Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly Obama administration, has said he would seriously look at the idea of dismantling companies like Facebook, but stopped short of calling for them to be broken up. Biden has also proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc. Maybe The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies, but has stopped short of calling for them to be broken up. The Justice Department sued Google in October, accusing the Internet company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals. Trump regularly bashes Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, and meets with Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook. When asked about big tech companies, Trump has said “there is something going on in terms of monopoly.”

Regulating social media Yes Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its stance on political ads, was the only Democratic presidential candidate who called for revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that largely exempts online platforms like Facebook and Twitter from legal liability for users’ posts. Biden has called for Facebook to fact-check politicians’ ads in the two weeks ahead of the presidential election. Yes Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused social media companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives. After Twitter put fact-checking labels on two of Trump’s tweets for the first time in May, the president signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms’ content moderation decisions and he backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230. Experts said the executive order was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny.

Stronger data privacy protections Yes Has said the U.S. should set privacy “standards not unlike the Europeans,” an apparent reference to the European Union’s stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Mixed Has signaled support for a federal consumer privacy legislation Has criticized Silicon Valley over the issue of encryption and blasted Apple for what he called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals. Has also stepped up efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps, such as ordering the sale of TikTok’s U.S. arm. Privacy advocates have slammed the Trump administration for actions they say violate immigrants’ privacy and for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of data.

Fixing the digital divide Yes Plans a $20 billion investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations. Yes The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband. Trump has said he is committed to ensuring “every citizen can have high-speed internet access.” In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund."
17,Why Joe Biden is better than Donald Trump for the US economy - The Guardian US,Why Joe Biden is better than Donald Trump for the US economy  The Guardian US,"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjAvc2VwLzI5L3doeS1qb2UtYmlkZW4taXMtYmV0dGVyLXRoYW4tZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLWZvci10aGUtdXMtZWNvbm9tedIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjAvc2VwLzI5L3doeS1qb2UtYmlkZW4taXMtYmV0dGVyLXRoYW4tZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLWZvci10aGUtdXMtZWNvbm9teQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Guardian US,"Joe Biden has consistently held a wide polling lead over US President Donald Trump ahead of November’s election. But, despite Trump’s botched response to the Covid-19 pandemic – a failure that has left the economy far weaker than it otherwise would have been – he has maintained a marginal edge on the question of which candidate would be better for the US economy. Thanks to Trump, a country with just 4% of the world’s population now accounts for more than 20% of total Covid-19 deaths – an utterly shameful outcome, given America’s advanced (albeit expensive) healthcare system.

The presumption that Republicans are better than Democrats at economic stewardship is a longstanding myth that must be debunked. In our 1997 book, Political Cycles and the Macroeconomy, the late (and great) Alberto Alesina and I showed that Democratic administrations tend to preside over faster growth, lower unemployment and stronger stock markets than Republican presidents do.

In fact, US recessions almost always occur under Republican administrations – a pattern that has persisted since our book appeared. The recessions of 1970, 1980-82, 1990, 2001, 2008-09, and, now, 2020 all occurred when a Republican was in the White House (with the exception of the double-dip recession of 1980-82, which started under Jimmy Carter but continued under Ronald Reagan). Likewise, the Great Recession of 2008-09 was triggered by the 2007-08 financial crisis, which also occurred on the GOP’s watch.

This tendency is not random: loose regulatory policies lead to financial crises and recessions. And, compounding matters, Republicans consistently pursue reckless fiscal policies, spending as much as Democrats do, but refusing to raise taxes to make up for the resulting budget shortfalls.

Owing to such mismanagement under the George W Bush presidency, President Barack Obama and Vice-president Biden inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression. In early 2009, the US unemployment rate surpassed 10%, growth was in free fall, the budget deficit had already exceeded $1.2tn, and the stock market was down almost 60%. Yet, by the end of Obama’s second term in early 2017, all of those indicators had massively improved.

In fact, even before the Covid-19 recession, US employment and GDP growth, as well as the stock market’s performance, were better under Obama than under Trump. Just as Trump inherited millions from his father, only to squander it on business failures, so he inherited a strong economy from his predecessor, only to wreck it within a single term.

The rally in equity prices this past August coincided with a hardening of Biden’s polling lead, suggesting that markets are not nervous about a Biden presidency, or about the prospects of a Democratic sweep of Congress. The reason is simple: a Biden administration would be unlikely to pursue radical economic policies. Biden may be surrounded by progressive advisers, but they are all fully within the political mainstream. Moreover, his vice-presidential pick, US Senator Kamala Harris of California, is a proven moderate, and most of the Democratic senators who would be seated in a new Congress are more centrist than the leftwing of their party.

Yes, a Biden administration might raise marginal tax rates on corporations and the top 1% of households, which Trump and congressional Republicans cut merely to give wealthy donors and corporations a $1.5tn handout. But a higher tax rate would result in only a modest hit to corporate profits. And any costs to the economy would be more than offset by closing the loopholes that allow for tax avoidance and shifting profits and production abroad, and with Biden’s proposed “Made in America” policies to bring more jobs, profits, and production home.

Moreover, while Trump and his fellow Republicans have not even bothered to formulate a policy platform for this election, Biden has proposed a suite of fiscal policies designed to boost economic growth. If Democrats take control of both houses of Congress and the White House, a Biden administration would pursue a larger fiscal stimulus targeted at households, workers, and small businesses that need it, as well as job-creating infrastructure spending and investments in the green economy. They would not invest in tax cuts for billionaires, but rather in education and worker retraining, and in proactive industrial and innovation policies to ensure future competitiveness. Private business would no longer be terrorised by the president in Twitter tantrums.

Democrats also are calling for higher minimum wages to boost labour income and consumption, along with more sensible regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They would push for policies to restore some bargaining power to workers, and to protect savers from predatory financial institutions. And they would have a much more sensible approach to trade, immigration, and foreign policy, repairing US alliances and partnerships and pursuing a policy of “coop-etition” rather than lose-lose containment vis-à-vis China. All these measures would be good for jobs, growth, and markets.

Although Trump ran as a populist, he is a wannabe plutocrat – a pluto-populist – and that is how he has governed. His economic policies have been disastrous for US workers and long-term economic competitiveness. Trade and immigration policies that were billed as measures to restore US jobs have had the opposite effect. The “deaths of despair” that disproportionately afflict white blue-collar and precariat workers have not fallen under Trump; with more than 70,000 drug overdose deaths in 2019, this American carnage continues. If the US is to fill the high-value jobs of the future, it will need to train its workers, not embrace self-destructive protectionism and xenophobia.

The choice for US voters who are concerned about America’s economic prospects could not be clearer. Biden, who has long tapped into blue-collar concerns, is the only presidential candidate in recent history without an Ivy League background. He has a better chance than anyone of rebuilding the Democratic coalition and winning back the support of disaffected, working-class voters. For all Americans who care about their and their children’s future, the right choice this November could not be clearer.

He trails on questions of character and most policy issues, like the coronavirus, health care and even crime.

Except one — and it's a big one: Americans in battleground states still trust Trump over Biden on the economy, which often tops the list of decisive issues for voters.

The president's edge on the economy has begun to worry some allies of Biden, who say he needs to do more to neutralize it or Trump could use it to nail down swing voters as Election Day nears. His lead persists even with 8.4 percent unemployment and during a recession that Democrats say has been fueled by Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.

""I do think there's work to do here in connecting the dots,"" said Hari Sevugan, a Democratic campaign veteran who worked for Pete Buttigieg's 2020 campaign and for Barack Obama in 2008. ""We need to do a better job of showing that a failure to deal with the pandemic was a failure to look out for the economy.""

Many voters don't see the issues as connected: Trump enjoys a net approval rating of 3.5 points on his stewardship of the economy in the RealClearPolitics average while getting a net disapproval score of 15 points on his handling of the coronavirus.

While Trump's economic edge has narrowed in national polls, it remains significant in key states likely to decide the election.

In Wisconsin, Trump enjoys a net approval of 8 points on his handling of the economy in a new poll by Marquette Law School. In Florida, Trump leads Biden by 13 points on which candidate is better on the economy, and in Pennsylvania he leads Biden by 10 points on the same question in a pair of NBC/Marist surveys released this week.

""We've done a really good job saying Trump is incompetent at handling just about every other issue,"" Sevugan said. ""The only thing that is his escape hatch is his handling of the economy. Closing off that lane for Trump does a lot of the work of the election.""

Biden steps up his economic message

Biden has delivered two speeches in the last week aimed at diminishing Trump's advantage on the economy. In Wilmington, Delaware, on Sept. 4, he said working Americans continued to suffer because Trump has ""mismanaged the COVID crisis."" On Wednesday in Warren, Michigan, he assailed the president for failing to keep his promise to bring jobs back to the United States.

A Biden adviser said the campaign has cut into Trump's margin on the economy and plans to keep chipping away at it by conveying to voters that when it comes to economic suffering, ""all roads lead back to COVID.""

The adviser, who discussed strategy on condition of anonymity, said Biden doesn't necessarily need to win the argument on the economy given his myriad other advantages. The adviser said breaking even or neutralizing the margin would sufficiently weaken the ""last pillar"" that is ""propping"" Trump up.

Robert Wolf, a Biden donor who founded the holding company 32 Advisors, said the recovery has been ""K-shaped,"" diverging for ""haves and have-nots,"" as opposed to the ""Super-V-shaped"" recovery claimed by Trump administration officials.

""Right now, people are focused a little more on COVID and school reopenings and the recent shootings, but I would agree that the overarching theme is going to be about who is best for the economy,"" he said. ""And I am just hopeful that Joe's messaging breaks through.""

Trump has touted the 1.4 million U.S. jobs added in August as evidence that the economy is on the rebound. It is an unprecedented scenario — the fastest economic collapse followed by one of the sharpest job recoveries in U.S. history, all in an election year.

""You have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in,"" Trump said Tuesday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""Next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in.""

The argument — focus on the past and the future, not the present — highlights the reality that as voters begin to cast ballots, the economy is both Trump's most powerful weapon and his most exposed target.

A big part of his task is to convince the small set of persuadable voters in key states that his record before the crisis shows he'll be better for their pocketbooks than Biden. That requires skipping over six months of shareholder joy and Main Street pain.

'Smoke and mirrors'

But voters can hold complicated sets of views. Biden leads on most substantive issues, and a clear majority of voters think he's more empathetic, honest and trustworthy than Trump. And while most Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic, they don't blame him for the economic fallout.

""For Democrats to contest it, to break even on the economy, is a total win,"" said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist, who said the issue typically favors the GOP.

Trump's other message — that Biden is controlled by anarchists who are inciting violence and crime in major cities — has fallen flat in polls.

Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics

Liam Donovan, a lobbyist and former GOP operative, said Trump's ""appeals to law and order definitely resonate with his base"" but probably won't move undecided voters. A positive economic message, however, could be a better closing argument.

""If President Trump is going to win four more years, it is because voters are hopeful about the future, not fearful. After a bumpy 2020, people are looking for some semblance of normalcy or at least hope,"" he said. ""The recent jobs numbers and anticipated GDP data could easily be worked into the argument that things are under control and moving in that direction.""

Rick Tyler, a longtime Republican strategist and outspoken Trump critic, said the president's advantage on the economy exists ""because Trump has told his story and has repeated that story ad nauseam"" that he built the greatest economy in history.

Tyler said Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration and stole credit for the continued pace of growth. And he said Biden needs to stay focused on puncturing Trump's economic narrative and not get ""sucked into"" his distractions.

""It's all smoke and mirrors,"" Tyler said. ""It is a false story, but, nevertheless, when there are no facts [being offered] to refute it, it becomes a truth."""
21,"Between the economy and coronavirus pandemic, Biden keeps his advantage nationally: POLL - ABC News","Between the economy and coronavirus pandemic, Biden keeps his advantage nationally: POLL  ABC News","Sat, 26 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvZWNvbm9teS1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1wYW5kZW1pYy1iaWRlbi1hZHZhbnRhZ2UtbmF0aW9uYWxseS1wb2xsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTczMjUyNDI10gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvUG9saXRpY3MvZWNvbm9teS1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1wYW5kZW1pYy1iaWRlbi1hZHZhbnRhZ2UtbmF0aW9uYWxseS1wb2xsL3N0b3J5P2lkPTczMjUyNDI1?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,ABC News,"In a race defined by economic views and pandemic fears, and riven by wide gender and education gaps, Joe Biden retains a 10-point lead nationally against Donald Trump in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, contracting to six points with third-party candidates included.

Biden's 54%-44% advantage over Trump in a two-way contest precisely matches the last national ABC/Post poll in mid-August. Biden's support slips to 49% when the Libertarian and Green Party candidates are included, versus 43% for Trump.

The results underscore Trump's precarious position as the first president in 81 years of modern polling never to achieve majority approval for his work in office. He's at 44% approval among all Americans, ranging from 52% for handling the economy to 40% on the coronavirus outbreak. Fifty-eight percent disapprove of his performance on the pandemic, a key to Biden's support.

At the same time, the presence of Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen and Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins could pose a challenge to Biden in close states. Biden's 5-point decline when these candidates are included is a significant, albeit slight, shift.

See PDF for full results, charts and tables.

Biden continues to trail Trump, by 20 percentage points, in strong enthusiasm among their respective likely voters in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. Still, another measure finds broad antipathy toward Trump: Among those who don't support him, 59% say his reelection would be a crisis for the country. Among those not backing Biden, fewer -- but still 50% -- say it'd be a crisis if he won.

It's true, as well, that national preferences don't always reflect Electoral College outcomes, as was the case in 2016 and 2000. Recent ABC/Post state-level polls found virtually even races in Florida and Arizona and a close contest in Wisconsin, although a wide Biden lead in Minnesota, which Trump has sought to contest.

Trump and Biden meet Tuesday in their first presidential campaign debate.

Change?

There's room for changes in preferences, but, as in any highly polarized election, not much. Among likely voters who don't back Trump now, 6% say they'd consider voting for him. Similarly, 5% of those who don't currently support Biden would consider him. That makes for a net total of 5% of likely voters who can be considered movable – a thin slice, albeit potentially enough to matter in some states.

What's likely to matter more is turnout, a question complicated this year by pandemic-related concerns. Just 46% of likely voters plan to cast their ballot in person on Election Day; 50% instead plan to vote early or absentee. Who goes through with it is highly consequential: Trump leads by 19 points, 58%-39%, among Election Day voters, while it's Biden by more than a 2-1 margin, 67%-31%, among those who intend to vote before then.

Issues

The pandemic, of course, has disrupted far more than balloting plans. Sixty-two percent of adults worry that they or an immediate family member may catch the virus, which has claimed more than 200,000 American lives. Likely voters who express this concern favor Biden, 71%-27%.

The economy, even in a pandemic-prompted recession, works better for Trump. While just 40% of Americans say it's in good shape, that's up from 31% just last month. And Trump leads by 82%-17% among likely voters who rate the economy positively. Further, a quarter call the economy the top issue in their vote, and those economy-focused voters favor Trump by 80%-18%.

That said, in a head-to-head test, the two candidates run very closely in trust to handle the economy, 49%-46%, Trump-Biden. And other results on trust are revealing: While Trump has hit hard on the issue of crime and safety, it's Biden who's slightly ahead in trust to handle it, 50%-44%. Biden leads by eight points in trust to handle the next Supreme Court nomination (as reported Friday), 11 points on the pandemic, 16 points on health care and 20 points on equal treatment of racial groups.

Trust on crime is about the same in the suburbs, 50%-46%, Biden-Trump, as nationally overall. Suburban men trust Trump more on crime by 20 points, but suburban women -- a group Trump has focused on -- trust Biden more, by 61%-37%. That tilts to Biden because of the share of suburban women -- about 1 in 3 -- who are racial or ethnic minorities. (Among suburban white women, it's 51%-46%, Biden-Trump.)

There's one warning flare here for Biden: His lead on trust to handle the pandemic has shrunk from 20 points during the summertime surge in cases in mid-July, 54%-34%, to today's 11-point margin, 51%-40%.

As noted, the economy leads as the most important issue, with no consensus on what comes next. Seventeen percent pick the pandemic as their top issue, and likely voters who say so support Biden by 84%-13%. About as many say it's either health care or equal treatment of racial groups; again more than 8 in 10 in both of these groups back Biden. Twelve percent cite crime and safety as their main concern -- and in this group, 84% support Trump. Lastly, 11% focus on the next Supreme Court nomination, with closer vote preferences, 54%-45%, Biden-Trump.

In another delineating result, the public by 54%-42% supports recent protests against police treatment of Black people. Eight in 10 supporters of these protests favor Biden; 77% of opponents are with Trump.

Across issues, these results illuminate the logic of the current campaign, as Trump touts economic recovery and raises crime concerns while Biden pushes on the pandemic response, health care and equal treatment, and both navigate the trickier Supreme Court issue.

Third party

The impact of third-party candidates may be tough to gauge, since the pandemic has constrained their campaigns just as it has Trump's and Biden's. This survey asked two-candidate preferences first, then re-asked the question with Jorgensen and Hawkins added. Biden, as noted goes from 54% to 49% with these two included; that decline is significant at the 90% confidence level, as opposed to the conventional standard, 95%.

Trump moving from 44% to 43% is not statistically significant. Four percent express support for Jorgensen, who's on the ballot in all 50 states; 3% for Hawkins, who's on the ballot in 28 states. (In 2016, the Libertarian won 3%, the Green candidate, 1%.)

Groups

Using two-candidate preferences, huge gaps are evident across population groups. Trump leads by 13 points among men; Biden, by a wide 31 points among women. Trump's up 6 points against Biden among nongraduates, while Biden leads by 30 points among college grads. The race is close among likely voters age 50 and older, while those younger than 30 back Biden by nearly 2-1 (using registered voters for an adequate sample size).

Unpeeling some groups demonstrates the depth of the gender gap, in particular. While the race is a close 52-47%, Biden-Trump, in the suburbs, that's 60-38%, Trump-Biden, among suburban men, compared with 66-34%, Biden-Trump, among suburban women. And it's Trump up 8 among men who are political independents, versus a 77%-20% Biden-Trump blowout among independent women.

In another sharp difference, evangelical white Protestants, a core Republican group, support Trump by an expected 75%-25% -- but non-evangelical white Protestants go 58%-41%, Biden-Trump. (White Protestants account for nearly 3 in 10 likely voters; 57% are evangelicals, the rest not.)

Notable, too, is that Trump and Biden are dead even, 49%-49%, in households that include a veteran or active-duty member of the military; these generally are thought to be a more pro-GOP group. Trump took criticism in the past month for reports that he had disparaged military service, which he denied.

Among other groupings, Biden leads by 54%-42% in the 13 states that currently are the most contested by the candidates (Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin). Moreover, it's Biden by 20 points in the blue states won by Hillary Clinton, while dead even, 49%-49%, in the 2016 red states. Trump won those states four years ago by 53%-42%.

2016 comparisons

Comparisons to 2016, based on ABC News exit poll results, are telling. Among the most striking differences:

Clinton won political moderates by 12 points. Biden leads among them by 47 points, 72%-25%.

Clinton won independent women by four points. As noted, Biden leads among them by a remarkable 57 points.

Trump won whites by 20 points in 2016; he's up six points among whites now. One reason: White women have switched from plus-9 points for Trump in 2016 to plus-15 points for Biden now, 57%-42%. That includes a vast shift among college-educated white women, from up 7 points for Clinton to up 41 points for Biden now.

Clinton won college-educated voters overall by 10 points; as noted, Biden now leads in this group by 30 points. In addition to college-educated white women, the change is sharp among people with postgraduate degrees, from up 21 points for Clinton four years ago to up 47 points for Biden now.

Non-evangelical white Protestants, as mentioned, support Biden by a 17-point margin; that compares to essentially an even split in 2016, 48%-45%, Trump-Clinton.

Trump, at the same time, has retained and even consolidated his core support groups. Overall, among 2020 likely voters who report having supported him in 2016, 91% support him now. He's backed by 87% of conservatives, who account for a substantial 36% of all likely voters. And while Biden would be just the second Catholic president, white Catholics -- an on-again, off-again swing voter group -- side with Trump, 55%-44%.

President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have offered strikingly different blueprints for lifting the U.S. out of the COVID-19-induced economic downturn – the nation’s worst since the Great Depression.

Trump has promised more cuts to taxes and regulations, and hinted at additional tariffs against China.

Biden has vowed to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations, using the trillions of dollars generated to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and shift to a clean-energy future, make housing and child care more affordable and improve education, among other proposals.

The two candidates also have laid out conflicting views of the pandemic and the economy. Trump generally has opposed additional state or federal restraints on businesses.

“We can’t keep this country closed,” he said during the candidates’ final debate last month. “The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.”

Biden says he doesn’t favor shutting down the country again but states or cities shouldn’t ease business constraints until the virus is tamed in their regions, adding that such a cautious approach will ultimately benefit the economy.

“I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country,” Biden said at the debate.

Some top economists say Biden’s overall plan is better-suited to recovering the remaining 11 million jobs lost in the pandemic-induced recession. About half the 22 million jobs shed have been recouped as shuttered businesses reopened and rehired workers.

“The goal of the next president will be to get back to full employment as fast as possible,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “Biden will get there a lot faster than Trump will.”

But some economists argue Trump’s free-enterprise approach will more effectively unleash business owners’ animal spirits.

“Overall, I think Trump will be better for the U.S. economy,” says economist Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. “Trump will be better from a free-market perspective.”

More layoffs?:'It's certainly going to get worse': Businesses plan more layoffs, hiring freezes in 2020 as COVID-19 escalates

Biden’s campaign has put forth a detailed blueprint of his infrastructure and other proposals that it says will create 12 million jobs. Trump has vowed to create 10 million jobs in 10 months but didn’t specify how.

Here’s a breakdown of their proposals:

Taxes

Biden: His administration would raise taxes and eliminate loopholes for individuals earning more than $400,000, restore tax rates to their level before Trump's tax bill was enacted; subject incomes above $400,000 to the 12.4% Social Security payroll tax (it now phases out at $138,000); and begin phasing out itemized deductions at incomes of $400,000.

Also, it would tax capital gains and dividend income at ordinary rates for incomes above $1 million. And increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, among other changes.

Upshot: The Tax Policy Center says the increases would boost tax revenue by $4 trillion over the next decade.

Economist Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics says she supports the plan because it targets wealthy individuals who likely would save, rather than spend, their tax windfall, doing relatively little harm to the economy.

But Cato’s Edwards argues it’s the wealthy who launch entrepreneurial ventures that expand the economy. Increasing their income and capital gains taxes will discourage such activities, he says.

“It would be a harsh blow to America’s innovation economy,” he says.

Trump: In his nomination speech, he suggested he’ll propose cutting individual taxes but didn’t say which.

“I will cut taxes even further for hard-working moms and dads,” he said. “I will not raise taxes. I will cut them, and very substantially.”

Trump also has said he’s considering reducing taxes for the middle class and on capital gains. Any such changes would have to be approved by Congress.

Hunkering down:Stores brace for post-election unrest and possibility of violence, damage to businesses after presidential results

An outline released by his campaign lists a “Made in America” tax credit and tax credits for companies that bring back jobs from China. It also cites 100% expensing deductions for industries like pharmaceuticals and robotics that bring manufacturing back to the U.S.

As part of Trump’s flurry of executive actions in August, he ordered the Treasury Department to let employers defer payment of certain payroll taxes from September 1 to the end of the year for Americans earning less than $100,000 a year.

Upshot: The Tax Foundation says it’s difficult to analyze the ideas without more details. But the group says the current tax code structure would make a middle-class tax cut difficult.

“The benefit of rate reductions would accrue to top earners as low earners face reduced (or zero) taxes.”

In 2017, Trump spearheaded a $1.5 trillion tax reform – the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act -- but the Tax Policy Center said most of the benefits went to the wealthiest households.

Zandi agrees with the Tax Foundation that it's difficult to assess the tax proposals because Trump doesn’t provide specifics.

He says, “Tax cuts provide a small economic bang for the buck, adding significantly to the nation’s debt load and providing little economic lift.“

New spending

Biden: He plans to upgrade the nation’s roads, bridges and highways; build a clean energy economy; invest in research and development to bolster manufacturing; ensure the government and its contractors buy American products; provide tuition-free community college; ensure access to affordable child care and universal preschool; and provide aid for Americans to buy or rent homes.

Upshot: Van Houten says the programs would help low- and middle-class households, significantly bolstering economic and job growth.

“Those are policies that have a big bang for the buck and generate a lot of economic activity,” Zandi says, a strategy he says is badly needed as the economy struggles to reclaim lost jobs.

Oxford says the programs would cost $7 trillion over 10 years, more than the $4 trillion generated by the tax increases. Van Houten says piling another $3 trillion onto a national debt – that already has swelled by about $2.5 trillion this year alone in response to the pandemic – is “manageable.”

“We need to get back to full employment,” Zandi says. “Once we get the jobs back, we can quickly pivot” to reducing the debt.

But Edwards opposes government decisions to fund programs that he says would be better made by private industry.

Trump: His administration would launch a space warfare branch of the military known as space force and establish a permanent manned presence on the moon; build the world’s “greatest infrastructure system;” fully fund police and law enforcement, and partner with other countries to clean up oceans.

Upshot: Trump has not released the costs of his proposals. Zandi says, “The spending he is proposing is small and will not provide a meaningful boost to the economy.""

Trade

Biden: The Democratic candidate has talked tough on China. His website says he’ll “take aggressive enforcement actions” against the country’s dumping of products in the U.S. below cost, its currency manipulation and other practices. But Biden says he’ll rally U.S. allies to confront China rather than take on the country by itself.

Although he has suggested he would remove Trump’s existing tariffs, an aide clarified that he’ll re-evaluate them after he takes office, according to The Washington Post.

Upshot: Van Houten says Biden’s strategy has a better chance of succeeding by enlisting the support of other nations. And Zandi says the removal of tariffs would reduce the cost of Chinese imports for American consumers and lead to the lifting of Chinese counter-tariffs on U.S. exports.

Trump: He recently threatened tariffs on companies that don’t move jobs back to the U.S. from overseas. Says he would not grant federal contracts to firms that outsourced to China. And would bring 1 million jobs back from China and hold that country accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world -- that originated in Wuhan – though he was not specific.

Trump already has imposed tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese imports.

Upshot: Zandi says Trump is doubling down on a trade war with China that has severely hurt the U.S. economy while delivering minimal benefits. A Moody’s study last September found the fight already had cost America’s economy nearly 300,000 jobs and 0.3% of gross domestic product by raising costs for consumers and curtailing U.S. exports through Chinese counter-tariffs.

Under Trump’s Phase 1 trade deal that suspended future tariffs on Chinese imports, China agreed to expand purchases of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion in 2020 and 2021. As of last month, China had bought 24% to 58% of its year-to-date target, depending on the product, according to a recent report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

China also agreed to impose harsher penalties for intellectual property theft but it’s unclear if Beijing is enforcing such provisions, says a Brookings Institution report this month.

“Ultimately, the phase one agreement disappointed because it, along with the trade war, severely damaged the U.S. economy while failing to make significant progress in fundamentally resolving the structural imbalances the U.S.-China trade relationship,” the Brookings study says.

Regulations

Biden: The candidate says he’ll roll back much of Trump’s cuts, especially environmental rules for the energy industry as he looks to combat climate change with his clean-energy plan.

Upshot: Adding rules that require clean energy, for example, will increase costs for consumers. But Zandi says it will address the potentially larger economic costs of climate change, such as hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Trump: The president says he’ll continue to aggressively cut regulations. He initially promised to scrap two rules for each new one and the Competitive Enterprise Institute says he has more than met that goal.

Upshot: Edwards says Trump’s regulations have unshackled businesses and sparked more investment and hiring. Zandi says no studies have shown that slashing regulations benefits the economy broadly.

Minimum wage

Biden: The candidate supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

“People are making six, seven, eight bucks an hour,” Biden said during the last debate. “They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that puts you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true.”

Trump: During the debate, he said he would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25 “to an extent” but he prefers leaving the matter to states, which could set the pay floor based on the cost of living in their regions. Raising the national minimum wage, he says, would lead small businesses to lay off workers.

“How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages?” Trump said. “What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees.”

Upshot: A Congressional Budget Office study last year found that raising the federal pay floor to $15 would boost the wages of 17 million workers. Another 10 million workers earning slightly more than $15 per hour might also see their wages rise as well, the report said. But 1.3 million other workers would lose their jobs as businesses offset their higher costs.

Several states are already gradually raising their base pay to $15, and dozens of cities and counties, along with leading corporations such as Amazon, are already there. A minimum wage hike to $15 will have little negative impact if it occurs gradually and follows market trends, Zandi says."

Jobs

Some Americans say they want to leave if Trump wins again. Here’s what life abroad is like for expats

By Jessica Menton

""The number of Americans, particularly young women, who say they desire to leave the U.S. permanently is on the rise. In fact, 40% of women younger than 30 say they would like to leave, the study showed. ...

""Canada is a top desired destination for would-be emigrant Americans, Gallup said. In September, Google reported a spike in the number of searches for “How to apply for Canadian citizenship” in the U.S. following the first raucous presidential debate. ...

""USA TODAY spoke with American expats who already took the plunge and left. Some fled to escape the political turmoil in the U.S. in recent years, while others moved abroad for new job opportunities. Or, they found love and got married.""

'I will be put out of my house': Some Americans who struggled early in crisis are on brink, others find jobs

By Paul Davidson, Charisse Jones and Jessica Menton

""Overall, the nation has recovered slightly more than half the 22.2 million jobs shed in March and April as businesses restarted and brought back many furloughed workers. But job growth has slowed substantially in the past few months. Some businesses have closed for good. And recouping the remaining 10.8 million lost jobs is expected to take far longer.

""While many of those whose struggles USA TODAY documented are now worse off, some have finally landed full- or part-time jobs, easing their distress or providing hope.""

Trump says economic recovery is V-shaped, Biden says it's a K. Who's right and what does it mean?

By Paul Davidson

""A V-shaped rebound is when the economy contracts sharply but bounces back just as dramatically. ...A rebound that resembles a K occurs when some parts of the economy bounce back sharply while others stumble. That is happening now and in more than one way.

""Another way to look at the economy’s split personality is by income level. Low-income workers in service industries such as restaurants and retail continue to struggle while professionals who can work from home remain largely unscathed. Wealthy Americans, meanwhile, are benefiting from the stock market’s rally from its pandemic-induced crash earlier this year, as (Joe) Biden pointed out.""

Social media

Judgment day for Facebook and Twitter: Trump election eve posts provide early Election Day test

By Jessica Guynn

""All the preparations of the past four years to protect the election have come down to this. Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube are pulling on their battle fatigues. They will be on high alert Tuesday and in coming days for any effort to destabilize the election or delegitimize the results.

""This heightened state is the result of the 2016 presidential election when the major online platforms were caught with their guard down as Russians inflamed the electorate with divisive messages, and falsehoods and hoaxes ran rampant.

""This time, the stakes are even higher. The full-blown partisan warfare of presidential campaigning that has ripped through social media in recent months may lead to an unprecedented torrent of misinformation, voter suppression efforts and even fomenting of violence, observers say.""

Stimulus package

Here are the top two things Americans want in the next stimulus package

By Jessica Menton

""Congress hasn't approved additional coronavirus relief since March, when both chambers came to bipartisan compromises on a handful of bills that totaled more than $3 trillion, including one-time $1,200 checks to Americans and a $600 weekly unemployment boost. But most of that relief dried up this summer as Republicans and Democrats continue to spar over another round of aid.

""We at USA TODAY reached out to our audience and asked them what they wanted in a stimulus bill. About two-thirds of respondents said they wanted a second round of $1,200 direct payments, and roughly one-quarter of them said they needed additional supplemental unemployment aid.

Fill out this survey:What do you want to know as we go into 2021?

""To be sure, even if the White House and Democrats strike a deal, Congress still faces challenges on passing legislation through the Republican-held Senate, where members have expressed hesitancy at spending trillions of dollars on COVID-19 relief.""

Is the stock market rooting for Trump or Biden? The answer may surprise you

By Jessica Menton

""Stocks have typically thrived under legislative gridlock in Washington, and a split Congress has historically been the best scenario for investors.

""Since 1950, the average annual stock return for the broad S&P 500 stock index was 17.2% under a split Congress, according to LPL Financial. It falls to 13.4% when Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and drops to 10.7% when Democrats control both chambers.

""That suggests that markets may prefer divided power come November because it would make it harder for lawmakers to undo policy measures already in place, experts say. The Republicans currently control the Senate and Democrats the House.""

Small businesses

Report: Thousands of PPP loans went to small businesses that should not have received them

By Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu

""Senators are in discussions to revamp the (Paycheck Protection Program) so that smaller businesses could apply for a second loan, with Republicans saying those with up to 300 workers should be eligible and Democrats proposing a cap of 100 employees.

""Many businesses have credited the program with keeping them alive when much of the economy closed down in the spring. But the need for such assistance has been alleviated somewhat by the decision by many state and local governments to ease social distancing restrictions."""
24,The Trump economy versus the Obama economy in 16 charts - The Washington Post,The Trump economy versus the Obama economy in 16 charts  The Washington Post,"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwLzA5LzA1L3RydW1wLW9iYW1hLWVjb25vbXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"As the United States suffers the worst economic downturn in nearly a century, key questions remain: How quickly can the nation recover, and who has the better track record to get us there? The dire job losses from the spring are close to half recovered, but 13.6 million workers remain unemployed. Stocks are back near record highs, but food bank lines are long and evictions in parts of the country are growing.

The 2020 presidential election will be, at least partly, about the economy. President Trump argues the economy was soaring pre-pandemic and he can bring it back again, while former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, argues the nation wouldn’t be in such bad shape if Trump hadn’t fumbled the handling of the pandemic. Biden says he can get people working again and points to the Obama administration’s track record after the Great Recession. Trump portrays the Obama era as sluggish.

Perhaps the best case Trump can make for improvement since he took office is higher wages and a boost in confidence. The average worker’s pay finally grew more than 3 percent a year under Trump, and there was a drop in the number of Americans on food stamps. Consumer and business confidence also jumped after Trump’s election and remained high after the GOP tax cuts took effect in 2018. As recently as February, many Americans rated this as the best economy since the late 1990s. Now those gains are wiped out.

The pandemic recession triggered more than 22 million job losses, modern-day bread lines and millions of pay cuts. Even before the pandemic hit, the picture was mixed. Manufacturing, business investment and growth were slowing noticeably heading into 2020.

While there’s ongoing debate about how much influence presidents really have over the economy, the charts below illustrate the trends under then-President Barack Obama and Trump.

1. Job gains (and losses)

The United States experienced some of its best years of job gains in 2014 and 2015 in Obama’s second term when the economy added more than 225,000 jobs a month. Employment continued to be strong under Trump — until the pandemic hit.

Average monthly job gains under Trump peaked at 193,000 in 2018. Economists call this very robust, especially given the recovery was nearly a decade old by then. But the devastation from the pandemic wiped out a decade’s worth of jobs gains in the spring. By August, 48 percent of the jobs had returned.

2. Economic growth

Trump says he had the “greatest economy in history” during the GOP convention, a claim fact-checkers quickly marked as false. A look at economic growth shows why.

The economy grew just shy of 1 percent in Obama’s first term when the Great Recession took its toll. Growth improved to 2.3 percent in Obama’s second term. Under Trump, the economy is on track to average slightly above zero in his first term because of the sharp losses from the pandemic.

Excluding 2020, growth in Trump’s initial three years in office was 2.5 percent — barely above Obama and well below the growth under the Clinton, Reagan and Johnson administrations.

3. U.S. unemployment

The U.S. unemployment rate hit a half-century low of 3.5 percent in late 2019 and stayed around that level through February 2020. Trump frequently touted the job news, though he often left out that the unemployment rate was a fairly low when he took office (4.7 percent) and has been steadily declining since 2011.

As the pandemic escalated, Trump and other officials opted to close down much of the economy to keep people home to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. This caused the official unemployment rate to soar to nearly 15 percent in April. The Labor Department had trouble doing its usual worker surveys during the pandemic and says the unemployment rate likely reached as high as 19.7 percent — a level not seen since the Great Depression. But as the economy reopened, many jobs came back. By August, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.4 percent, a level that’s still high but not unprecedented.

4. Black unemployment rate

Trump has started making the claim that his administration has done more for African Americans than “any president since Abraham Lincoln,” which The Washington Post Fact Checker gave Four Pinocchios. A key part of Trump’s argument is the Black unemployment rate, which hit the lowest level ever recorded — 5.4 percent — in August 2019. (The Labor Department began tracking the Black rate in 1972).

When Trump took office, Black unemployment was 7.5 percent. Many of the job gains under Trump did go to Black and Hispanic workers, especially women. As the labor market tightened, many employers gave a chance to workers they were not looking at before, such as those without college degrees. The pandemic, however, has hit Black and Hispanic workers the hardest, erasing many of the gains it took years to see after the Great Recession. In August, the Black unemployment rate was 13 percent.

5. Middle-class income

Middle-class households were hit hard during the Great Recession. For years, their incomes remained lower than in the late 1990s, once the cost of living was taken into account. While incomes rose the most during the final two years of Obama’s term, median household income did not officially equal its 1999 level until 2018, according to the U.S. Census.

Economists generally credit Obama with getting the recovery solidly underway and Trump with keeping it going until the pandemic recession. The steady job and pay gains in recent years have been the biggest drivers of rising middle-class incomes.

6. U.S. stock market

One of Trump’s favorite indicators is the U.S. stock market. Even with the deep blow of the pandemic that caused a 30 percent drop in stocks in March, the market has come roaring back this summer. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index recently surpassed its pre-pandemic record level thanks largely to surging tech stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft and Google’s parent, Alphabet. The index has fallen some in the past week.

Many economists are quick to point out the stock market is not the economy. Analysts also note that stocks gained more in Obama’s first term than Trump’s. But that comes with a caveat: Stocks began Obama’s presidency in a deep slump from the financial crisis and then began an epic rebound a few weeks into his presidency. The market was already high when Trump took office and has climbed higher since then. Though Obama had better market gains, both presidents have been good for Wall Street.

7. Food stamps

While the stock market was quick to soar under Obama, many people were quick to point out that the United States still had record numbers of Americans on food stamps, a sign of the lingering pain of the Great Recession. By 2013, roughly 1 in every 6 Americans was on government food aid. That declined only slightly by the end of Obama’s tenure.

The Trump administration made it a goal to get the number of Americans on food stamps down, including by tightening rules about who is eligible for food aid. As a result of more stringent eligibility rules and more job gains in recent years, the number of Americans on food stamps dropped to 35.7 million in 2019 — the lowest level since 2009. The pandemic has ushered in deep hardship again, causing many Americans to seek food stamps and visit food banks for the first time. Photos of long lines of cars waiting outside food banks during the pandemic have been dubbed modern-day bread lines.

8. Manufacturing output

The end of Obama’s second term saw a mini manufacturing recession that deeply hurt blue-collar workers even as the service economy continued to chug along. Trump vowed to revive factories. Early on in his presidency, manufacturing jobs and output jumped. In 2018, manufacturing jobs were growing at the fastest clip since the early 1980s. But it didn’t last.

Manufacturing output and jobs stalled in 2019, an early warning sign of economic trouble. The pandemic was a major blow. Real-time indicators show some rebound in manufacturing, especially as auto sales and home sales have bounced backed. But manufacturing employment remains more than 700,000 jobs below pre-pandemic levels.

9. U.S. home prices

Home prices have been on a steadily upward climb even since bottoming out in 2011. A lot of this growth has been driven by the Federal Reserve. The Fed has kept interest rates low, which has led to historic lows in mortgage rates that have made home-buying more affordable for many families (as long as they have savings for a down payment).

Even the pandemic didn’t put much of a dent in home purchases. In fact, some city dwellers have been rushing to the suburbs in search of bigger homes with more space. That trend, combined with a surge in millennials buying homes and mortgage rates below 3 percent, have fueled a housing boom. The median home price in the United States hit $304,100 in July, according to the National Association of Realtors. It’s the highest price on record, surpassing the prior 2006 high in inflation-adjusted terms.

10. U.S. government debt

Both Obama and Trump have been criticized for growing the national debt. Spending increased under Obama as the federal government tried to revive the economy after the Great Recession, as well as fund the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and continuing most of the Bush tax cuts.

Trump’s 2017 tax cut added about $1.5 trillion more to the debt, contrary to claims by the president’s administration that it would not. Then the pandemic hit and Congress responded with more than $3 trillion in aid. The result is the national debt is at the highest levels since World War II. The closely watched debt-to-GDP ratio, a sign of how big U.S. debt held by the public is relative to the economy, is on track to surpass 100 percent in the coming months.

Many economists say the bulge in spending after the Great Recession and pandemic recession were necessary and unavoidable, but they fault Obama and Trump for not doing more to right the federal budget during the good economic years.

11. Consumer confidence

Consumer spending drives about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. Many economists and business leaders closely watch signs of consumer confidence to see if Americans are likely to keep buying. The two main gauges of consumer confidence are monthly surveys by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan. Both showed an increase in confidence after Trump’s election, largely because Republicans and independent voters rated the economy more highly.

As the unemployment rate continued to decrease, confidence hit levels not seen since the late 1990s in early 2020. Though much of the economy under Trump looked similar to under Obama, many Americans appeared to feel better about their job and business prospects. Then the pandemic hit, causing confidence to tank. Nearly 1 in 3 Americans now worries about losing their job, according to Gallup.

12. Wages

While the economy did a big U-turn under Obama, his administration admitted that its “unfinished business” was seeing wages grow faster again. When the economy is performing well, it’s usually hard for employers to find enough workers, and they start lifting pay by more than 3 percent a year. That did not happen in the Obama era. It took until the summer of 2018 to finally see average hourly earnings rising above 3 percent.

13. Gas prices

Gas prices were well above $3 a gallon for much of Obama’s tenure. Many Americans see these prices as they drive to work, and it influences their overall feeling about the economy. As prices rise, they tend to feel gloomier as gas costs eat into their weekly pay. But oil prices plunged in 2014 as the world’s major oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, refused to cut back production, leading to a glut of oil on the world market.

When Trump took office, gas prices were just $2.37 a gallon, on average. They have remained low throughout Trump’s first term, helping keep costs manageable for many Americans. Though Trump likes to tout that America is now “energy independent” because it exports oil again, the reality is the nation still depends on imports of crude oil from abroad. The rise and fall of gas prices are largely driven by the world market and power players like Saudi Arabia that have continued to pump cheap oil.

14. Americans with health insurance

Obama made it one of his top goals to get more Americans covered by health insurance. The number of Americans lacking health insurance went from more than 48 million people in 2010 down to 28 million after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

The uninsured rate has remained low under Trump, though it ticked up slightly after Trump did away with the penalty for American adults who don’t buy health insurance. Trump also made it a goal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but that has not happened in his first term.

15. Business investment

An ongoing problem for the U.S. economy in recent years has been sluggish business investment. The economy tends to perform better when firms spend more on new research, products and equipment, since that tends to lead to more innovation.

Business investment was slow at the end of Obama’s second term. Trump and many Republicans said their 2017 tax cut would spur a business investment boom. Though 2018 did see improved business investment, the bump was short-lived. Business investment was anemic again in 2019, even before the pandemic’s economic blow.

16. Trade deficit

Most economists paid little attention to the trade deficit before Trump ran for office. The United States has purchased more goods from abroad than it has sold for years, largely because American consumers like to shop. Economists didn’t worry about this because foreign nations would turn around and invest in the U.S., so the dollars typically came back, one way or another.

But Trump insisted deficits were a sign of weakness. He promised his trade deals would get the deficit back down. What happened instead is the overall trade deficit in 2018 was the largest in a decade."

Opinion polling suggests that voters favour former Vice-President Joe Biden when it comes to social policy, foreign policy, the environment and managing the pandemic, not to mention personal character. But until recently, some polls indicated that on the economy, voters favoured Donald Trump.

The general impression that the US economy does better under Republicans than Democrats is long-standing. But the facts do not support it.

In the 16 complete presidential terms since the second world war, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, annual GDP growth averaged 4.3% under Democratic presidents, versus 2.5% under Republicans. Trump’s presidency has pulled down the Republican score further. In fact, average annual growth during his term to date has actually been negative.

The necessary qualifier in such comparisons is that the president is only one of many influences on the economy. Luck also plays a big role. One might choose to exclude 2020 from Trump’s record, for example, on the grounds that the coronavirus was just bad luck. But even the pre-pandemic increases in GDP, employment and the stock market under Trump merely continued trends that he inherited from Obama.

Moreover, one cannot absolve Trump of responsibility for mismanaging the pandemic. His only “plan” remains to predict that the virus will disappear within a few weeks. He has aggressively undermined the measures urged by experts, such as mask-wearing and mass testing, which would have better protected both public health and the economy.

In any case, the difference in average economic performance between Democratic and Republican administrations is statistically significant – that is, not attributable to pure chance.

A simple calculation can make the point. The last five recessions, including the current one, all started while a Republican was in the White House. If the chances of a recession beginning under a Democratic or Republican president were equal, then the odds of that happening would be one in 32, or just over 3% – the same as the chance of getting the same result on five consecutive coin tosses. That’s not very likely.

The difference in past performance seems too strong to be true. Ideally, we would be able confidently to identify and quantify policies that Democratic presidents have adopted that could directly explain the disparity. But that is a tall order. So, let us consider instead the policies that a Biden administration can be expected to implement, at least if the election produces a Senate he can work with.

Trump has been trying to convince voters that Biden would introduce radical leftist policies if elected. Some other candidates for the Democratic nomination did support policies that if interpreted literally were well to the left of most of the American electorate, and even to the left of the median Democratic voter. These included Senator Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” proposal, which would have abolished private health insurance, and the federal job guarantee in the Green New Deal legislation proposed by congressional Democrats.

Although Biden has explicitly rejected these policies, and won the Democratic nomination as a moderate, his economic plan differs hugely from Trump’s approach. The recent Republican national convention did not produce a platform, so we must look at the president’s first-term actions to assess what he might do if re-elected. Three stand out: his attempts to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the December 2017 tax cut that mostly added to corporate profits, and a trade war that has left almost everyone worse off. Although Trump promises to help American workers, these policies have the opposite effect, as at least 850 economists agree.

By contrast, Biden’s policy proposals address goals that most Americans share: restoring economic prosperity, doing more to help households left behind even before the pandemic and restoring progress on environmental protection. Moreover, he would pursue these goals in ways that are practical, rather than merely sounding good on a bumper sticker.

For starters, Biden would implement a federal plan to combat the coronavirus, informed by scientists’ and health professionals’ expertise. This includes making free testing widely available, eliminating cost barriers to Covid-19 prevention and treatment, developing a safe, effective and reliable vaccine and strengthening America’s public-health capacity to manage future crises.

Biden would renew big spending programmes that Congress has allowed to lapse, such as emergency paid leave for those who need to stay home from their jobs for health reasons. He would continue strong macroeconomic stimulus until income and employment returned to pre-pandemic levels.

Large-scale investments in infrastructure, research and development, and education that boost productivity growth over time also are central to the Biden plan. Furthermore, he would build on Obamacare’s achievements and sharply reduce the number of Americans who lack health insurance, rather than reversing these advances, as the Republicans have worked to do.

Biden proposes to finance such spending by progressive taxation, including by rolling back the 2017 corporate tax cut and raising the cap on wages that are subject to the payroll tax which helps fund social security. He has promised not to increase taxes on incomes below $400,000 (£307,000). Moody’s Analytics estimates that the gains from Biden’s proposed new spending would outweigh the dampening effect of his tax increases; by 2024, real GDP would be 4.5% higher than under current policies.

Biden would pursue environmental goals aggressively. Although his strategy includes continued rapid expansion of renewable energy, we should not pretend that solar and wind power can supply 100% of US energy needs in the near future. Biden doesn’t think fracking should be banned in those parts of the country that want the jobs it brings. But methane leaks and other negative environmental side effects can and should be tightly curbed by regulation; if not, fracking should not proceed.

Finally, a Biden administration would seek to restore America’s previous international role by keeping the US in the World Health Organization, rejoining the Paris climate agreement, abiding by other international agreements and treating our allies better than our adversaries.

Post-war Democratic presidents have been significantly better for the US economy than Republicans have. There is every reason to believe that trend will continue if Biden wins on 3 November. There have been few elections with such a discernible difference in the likely quality of the two candidates’ economic policies. In this case, Biden’s are better.

Resolution (PDF) | One Pager (PDF)

WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Maxine Waters (CA-43), Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, and Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution outlining a bold plan for President-elect Joe Biden to cancel up to $50,000 in Federal student loan debt for student loan borrowers using existing legal authority under the Higher Education Act.

The resolution, which outlines a pathway for the President-elect to use executive authority to cancel student loan debt while ensuring cancellation does not result in any tax liability for Federal student loan borrowers, is the House companion to Senate Resolution 711, introduced by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) earlier this year. Original co-sponsors of the House resolution include Congresswomen Madeleine Dean (PA-04), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Barbara Lee (CA-13) and Jahana Hayes (CT-05).

“The student debt crisis is a racial and economic justice issue and we must finally begin to address it as such. Broad-based student debt cancellation is precisely the kind of bold, high-impact policy that the broad and diverse coalition that elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris expect them to deliver,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “As we work to fight for meaningful economic relief for workers and families that meets the scale and scope of the crisis we face, canceling student debt is one of the most effective ways to provide direct relief to millions, help reduce the racial wealth gap, stimulate our economy, and begin to deliver an equitable and just recovery. On day one of his Administration, President-elect Biden will have the executive authority to cancel billions in student debt with the stroke of a pen. This resolution lays out a plan for him to do exactly that.” “Over 90 percent of student debt is held by the federal government, which President-elect Joe Biden can cancel with the stroke of a pen,” said Congresswoman Omar. “Young people have been devastated by this economic crisis, with more than half living with their parents. Student debt cancellation would be a massive economic stimulus at a time when people desperately need it. It’s also a racial equity issue. Students of color are more likely to take out federal student loans, and face higher rates of default. That’s why I introduced the Student Debt Cancellation Act last year, and have called on leaders to make student debt relief a centerpiece of a coronavirus response package. It’s why a majority of the country supports student debt relief. And it’s why leaders from both Houses of Congress for substantial relief. Student debt cancellation isn’t just an economic priority, it is a moral necessity.” “As the student debt crisis continues to grow more urgent and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis continues to impact our communities and economy, the need to provide relief to student loan borrowers buried under mountains of debt is critical,” said Chairwoman Maxine Waters. “As a leader on this issue, I held a Financial Services Committee hearing last year on the student debt crisis and its adverse impact on individuals, families, and the economy. I helped to secure critical protections for student borrowers, including a pause on student loans during the pandemic, and advocated for legislation to help borrowers affected by the student debt crisis. Most recently, I wrote to President-elect Biden to recommend that he issue an executive order to promptly forgive up to $50,000 of debt for each student borrower and I am so pleased to join with Congresswomen Pressley, Adams, and Omar, who have all been critical voices in this fight, to address this crisis. I cannot overstate the importance of this resolution and the need for the Biden Administration to take bold action and deliver on this mandate from the people on day one.” “The incoming Biden-Harris Administration has the opportunity to change lives and jumpstart our economy on day one by cancelling $50,000 in student loan debt,” said Congresswoman Adams. “These loans are holding American families back from buying houses, cars, and opening small businesses. Student loan debt prevents young families from building and creating wealth that they can pass down to their children and grandchildren – a freedom that historically has been denied to Black Americans in this country. Starting on January 20, it’s up to us to rebuild the bridge to the middle class for millions of Americans. Let’s start by cancelling the debt.”

Long before the COVID-19 crisis, 45 million Americans were being crushed under the weight of an unprecedented $1.6 trillion student loan debt crisis. The unequal burden of the student debt crisis has disproportionately fallen on Black and Latinx borrowers who, as a result of generations of systemic racism and predatory policies, have been locked out of wealth building and have been forced to take on more debt, more often, just for a chance at the same degree as their white peers. The student debt crisis is both a racial and economic justice crisis, and student debt cancellation is bold, responsive policy that will help ensure the economic recovery strategy will prioritize workers and families and reduce the longstanding racial wealth gap.

Specifically, the resolution:

Recognizes the Secretary of Education’s broad administrative authority to cancel Federal student loan debt.

Urges the President to take executive action on day one of his Administration to cancel $50,000 in Federal student loan debt per borrower using the current legal authorities already granted by Congress.

Calls on the President to use existing authorities to prevent debt cancellation from resulting in a tax bill for borrowers.

Encourages the President to ensure that administrative debt cancellation helps to close racial wealth gaps.

Urges the President to extend the current payment relief on all Federal student loan payments and interest for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Millions of borrowers had faced crushing burdens because of student loan debt now made worse by the economic devastation of COVID-19,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “As a result too many are choosing between loan payments, and housing, food, and medication. Four years of mismanagement of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and the ongoing nightmare of corporate servicers who have made huge profits off federal student loan debt has turned higher education financing into a business venture for the United States. Administrative student debt cancellation would be a game-changer for borrowers across the country, and an important first step in President-Elect Biden’s effort to help families recover.” “Student Debt cancellation is a racial justice issue since Black and Brown borrowers face the greatest hurdles when it comes to access, affordability, and retention in higher education,” said Tiffany Loftin, National Director, Youth and College Division, NAACP. In order to make education a right, we need radical policy that addresses the needs of 44.7 million people who are shackled by debt, that starts with cancellation now.” “We applaud Representative Ayanna Pressley and allies in Congress for urging President-elect Joe Biden to use existing authority to cancel student debt. A nationwide, grassroots movement has called for debt cancellation for years and we are closer to permanent relief than ever before. The leadership and support of champions in Congress couldn’t come at a more important time,” said Natalia Abrams, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy organization Student Debt Crisis. “As the COVID-19 pandemic grows, far too many people are choosing between student loan payments and making rent, putting food on the table, and keeping the lights on. President-elect Joe Biden can change that. Canceling student debt will provide much-needed financial relief for individuals and boost the economy for years to come. It will also help close the racial wealth gap that is widening due to the disparate impact of the pandemic. And, as Representative Pressley reminds us, the president-elect can do all of this on Day One using executive action.” “Canceling student debt not only would be a lifeline to 45 million people, some of whom are struggling under the weight of their debt, it would help build a more robust economy,” said Remington A. Gregg, Counsel for Civil Justice and Consumer Rights at Public Citizen. “It’s supported by a majority of Americans. And it makes good on the commitment so many leaders have made over the past year to focus on racial equity by working to close the racial wealth gap and giving Black and Brown borrowers a real chance to succeed.” “We need to acknowledge that our student loan system is fundamentally broken and the first step to repair it is through across-the-board debt cancellation,” said Ashley Harrington, Federal Advocacy Director and Senior Counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending. “We applaud Congresswoman Pressley and Congresswomen Omar, Adams, and Chairwoman Maxine Waters for introducing this important legislation and supporting the urgent need for administrative debt cancellation. The time has come for a new Administration to prevent further financial devastation for those who are disproportionately struggling the most under the weight of their student debt burden, Black borrowers and communities of color.” “We applaud Representatives Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Alma Adams and House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters for their leadership fighting for the economic needs of millions of families,” said Alexis Goldstein, senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform. “No type of consumer debt is more widely held by the government than federal student loans. Cancelling federal student debt is a critical tool the government has to provide more funds for basic household needs when so many are on the precipice of financial ruin.” “From big cities to small towns, one constant is the crushing weight of student debt,” said Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Seth Frotman. “With the stroke of a pen, President-elect Biden has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to cancel student debt and improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans.” “We applaud Congresswomen Pressley, Omar, Adams and Chairwoman Maxine Waters in calling on cancellation of up to $50,000 in federal student loan debt which is caused by a system that has been inequitable and broken for decades. Student loan debt disproportionately burdens Black and Brown Americans and exacerbates the racial wealth gap. Abusive debt collection practices take funds like the Earned Income Tax Credit from borrowers’ safety nets and garnish borrowers’ wages, making it even harder for those who need every penny to put food on their families’ tables and contribute to their local economies. Student debt cancellation is urgently needed on Day 1,” said Persis Yu, director of the National Consumer Law Center’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. “We can empower a generation, stimulate the economy, and begin to close the racial wealth gap on day one by enacting broad student debt cancellation,” said Dr. Kyle Southern, Policy and Advocacy Director, Higher Education and Workforce. “Taking this action is critical to advancing an equitable economic recovery. The compounding impact of systemic racism and gender discrimination on student borrowers who are Black, Latinx, and women means they incur more debt out of necessity and take longer to repay that debt. Currently, women borrowers hold two-thirds of all student debt. Broad student debt cancellation would substantially boost Black, Latinx, and women-led households, help close the racial wealth gap, and avert default.”

Congresswoman Pressley has been leading the legislative fight for broad student debt cancellation. Reps. Pressley, Adams, and Omar have repeatedly led their colleagues in calling on House leadership to include student debt cancellation in any COVID relief package. In March, Pressley and Omar introduced the Student Debt Emergency Relief Act, legislation to cancel student loan debt and shield borrowers from any involuntary payments and garnishment during the COVID-19 crisis.

When President Trump rang in 2020, the economy was one of his biggest selling points for reelection. He had inherited a strong economy from the Obama administration, and it continued to grow stronger during his first term. Unemployment was hovering at a 50-year-low, GDP growth was exceeding expectations and Wall Street was riding the longest bull market in its history.

But by spring, all of that came crashing down. While the economy has begun to shakily recoup some of its losses, a full and speedy recovery is anything but assured, making it a top concern for many Americans. According to a poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation released earlier this month, registered voters ranked the economy as the most important issue in deciding their pick for president, putting it ahead of the ongoing pandemic.

Trump is now trying to convince the country that since he oversaw a robust economy before the outbreak, he’s the best candidate to restore it. His opponent, Joe Biden, argues that Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus compounded its impact on an economy that was inequitable to begin with and that it should be reimagined rather than rebuilt.

Here’s how the candidates’ economic plans compare:

Another wave of coronavirus relief

In the first months of the coronavirus crisis, Trump signed off on roughly $3 trillion in relief funding, but now negotiations for another package to help Americans weather the storm have been at an impasse for weeks — and although White House negotiators and Democratic leaders say they will soon restart talks, the odds of seeing any new aid passed before Election Day seem slim.

Trump finally weighed in earlier this month, urging budget hawk Republicans to back another stimulus bill with “much higher numbers” and signaled openness for a $1.5 trillion proposal put forth by a bipartisan group of lawmakers that calls for between $450 and $600 in enhanced federal unemployment benefits, more support for small businesses as well as state and local governments, and another round of direct payments. However, Democrats are calling for an even higher price tag, so both parties remain at odds.

Trump’s power to push through new measures in a second term depends largely on how the House and Senate swing, but he’s already attempted to swerve legislative gridlock in the past through executive actions—deferring payroll taxes, suspending federal student loan payments through the end of the year and extending unemployment payments at a rolled-back rate.

Economists say these measures have had a limited impact, and more meaningful relief would likely require cooperation with Congress. Trump has said he would take further steps if reelected, like forgiving the deferred payroll taxes, but that plan likely only stands a chance if Republicans control both chambers on Congress in November, and could potentially shortchange Social Security Trust Funds while doing nothing to help the millions who aren’t collecting a paycheck.

Biden has a sweeping plan for a post-pandemic economy but has supplied few details on how he plans to buoy it until the coronavirus is contained — likely in part because Congress could take action before he would take office.

Biden says he would seek to inject up to $2 trillion dollars into the economy in January, following it up with more comprehensive policy that would come with a price tag around $3 trillion, according to an Axios report. But—like Trump—Biden’s chances of passing ambitious policies depend largely on what party controls the House and Senate.

Biden has previously called on Congress to pass additional expanded unemployment benefits, more funding for nutrition and health programs, as well as more money for state and local governments, echoing the priorities of the House's $3 trillion Heroes Act passed in May.

Creating jobs

With unemployment at 8.4% and likely to take months, if not years, to return to pre-pandemic levels, creating more jobs will be a top priority for whoever sits behind the resolute desk next year.

During his first term, Trump relied on deregulation and lowering corporate taxes to encourage growth. If reelected, he has vowed to go even further--promising to create 10 million new jobs in ten months during his second term and 1 million new small businesses, although he has not specifically laid out how he’ll hit those targets.

“We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before,” he said during the Republican National Convention.

Biden plans to take the opposite approach. He says he will raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and use that revenue as well as deficit spending to upgrade the country’s infrastructure and shift to a clean-energy production, creating jobs in the process.

However, economists note increasing regulations--like those Biden has proposed to cap carbon emissions--will likely increase some costs for consumers. But Biden argues that without intervention, the cost of climate change will be much higher in the long run, and experts say it’s already contributing at least in part to an uptick in billion-dollar weather disasters.

Biden supports a $15 minimum wage. Trump has also considered backing the Democratic proposal in the past, but has not publicly endorsed it.

Trump has previously claimed income inequality was on the decline—often citing record low pre-pandemic unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic workers as evidence his policies benefited cross sections of the country. But U.S. Census Bureau revealed income inequality hit a new peak in 2019, continuing a decades-long trend.

Biden’s economic agenda is tailored to address persistent racial inequality, funneling federal money to Black and brown-owned businesses and predominately minority neighborhoods.

Tax Plans

Trump is promising to build on what many see as his crowning legislative victory—the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which rolled back taxes for both individuals and businesses.

The cuts reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and lowered most personal income tax brackets. Although they greatly increased the federal deficit he promised to wipe out. Trump credits those cuts for boosting the economy and while lowering the unemployment rate to 3.5%.

While the complexity of the 2017 reform and limited available data makes its impact difficult to fully assess, Biden and others on the left contend those cuts disproportionately benefited corporations and the wealthy, and has pledged to undo some of them. He says he will keep the cuts for middle-class, while significantly raising taxes on companies and individuals making more than $400,000 a year in order to fund education, health care and other social programs.

A number of tax policy think tanks say that some of Biden’s proposals could unintentionally result in some households seeing a their taxes slightly increased. Biden has also said he would reinstate the individual mandate -- the penalty for not having health insurance created by the Affordable Care Act that was eliminated by the 2017 tax cuts, a move that exposed the health care reform law he plans to build on to greater Constitutional challenges.

However, Biden says he also aims to reduce some taxes. He said he would repeal the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction instituted by the 2017 bill, which primarily impacts high-income households in areas with high state taxes, like California and New York. He also plans to offer tax credits aimed at accomplishing different policy goals—such as reinstating or expanding incentives intended to reduce carbon emissions and helping low- and middle-income families offset the costs of home buying.

One area the candidates’ tax plans differ starkly is capital-gains—taxes paid on profits realized from the sale of real estate, stocks, or other assets.

Republicans have long seen capital gains tax cuts as a way to spur new economic activity, but didn’t change the rules when they passed TCJA Trump now wants to lower the top rate of those taxes from 23.8% to somewhere between 15% and 18.8%.

The president also says he want to expand Opportunity Zones, a federal program that provides tax incentives--including deferrals on capital gains taxes—for investors that fund projects in underserved communities.

Biden has said he would limit the Opportunity Zones program, which critics contend provides financial boons for wealthy investors without guaranteeing any benefit for distressed neighborhoods. Instead, he would directing the Department of Treasury to ensure “tax benefits are only being allowed where there are clear economic, social, and environmental benefits to a community, and not just high returns,” according to his platform.

Biden also intends to nearly double the top capital-gains rate to 39.6%; that rate would apply only to households with income exceeding $1 million.

Trade Policy

How to handle foreign trading partners may be the area of the candidates’ agendas that overlaps the most, but there’s still a world of difference.

Trump made “America first” a pillar of his 2016 campaign, and has largely kept his promise—even if it has had mixed results for the economy.

He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership soon after taking office and replaced NAFTA—two trade agreements Biden previously supported.

Trump also waged a costly trade war with China—accusing the world’s second largest economy of unfair practices and stealing intellectual property.

Both countries imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of each other’s goods. The cost of the tariffs imposed by the U.S. was almost entirely absorbed by American businesses and consumers, according to analysis by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

In January of this year, the U.S. and China signed a phase one trade deal, dialing down some of the disputes. However, talks toward another agreement have sputtered, while tensions between the countries remain high.

But Biden has also vowed to be tough on China. He called Trump’s trade war an “unmitigated disaster,” but says he will “take aggressive trade enforcement actions against China or any other country seeking to undercut American manufacturing through unfair practices.” He has also not definitively said whether he would eliminate Trump’s tariffs on the countries.

Biden is unlikely to take on China alone--he has said he would work with U.S. allies to curb economic interference from Beijing.

On day one, whichever candidate is elected is likely to prioritize bringing economic activity back to the U.S. above trade with foreign partners.

Both Trump and Biden say they will offer incentives for bringing jobs back to the country, while imposing penalties for offshoring."

The Biden-Harris transition website lists four priorities for the forthcoming administration: COVID-19, economic recovery, racial equity and climate change.

How well do these priorities sync with U.S. public opinion? One way to answer that question is to use Gallup's monthly update on Americans' views of the most important problem facing the country as a surrogate measure of the public's priorities. As my Gallup colleague Lydia Saad reviewed this week, the top five problems facing the country today, from Americans' viewpoint, are: COVID-19, poor government/poor government leadership, race relations/racism, the economy in general and the need to unify the country.

The Biden-Harris transition priorities coincide with three of these: COVID, race relations and the economy. The public does not mention climate change with any significant frequency as the nation's top problem. And, the Biden-Harris team does not mention efforts to fix the way government operates or unifying the country, although we assume this is an underlying theme for the team, given Joe Biden's assertions that it is ""time to heal"" the country and his vow ""not to divide, but to unify"" once he is president.

Of Biden's ""big four"" priorities, I think it is fair to say that tackling COVID-19 accrues the least controversy from the public's perspective. It has been at or near the top of Americans' most important problem list since April and clearly is a tentacular issue that essentially affects everyone.

There is less public agreement on the degree to which the government should intervene in efforts to tackle climate change. Less than half of Americans say they worry a great deal about climate change, and less than half say global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetime. At the same time, the public supports a number of individual initiatives that are considered to be ways to mitigate climate change, such as the prioritization of renewable energy over fossil fuels.

Americans agree that racial equity is an important issue, but there are wide differences in public opinion on the most efficacious way to approach it. As I summarized in a recent review, ""A majority of Americans agree with the underlying conclusion that racial inequities in U.S. society need to be addressed. … But we find much less agreement with a number of the specific proposed remedies that would produce the most significant changes in the situation.""

That leaves us the economy, which has certainly been a major focus for almost all incoming presidential administrations throughout history. The economy is not at the very top of the list when Americans are asked to name the most important problem facing the nation, but I think that's because it is essentially drowned out in many Americans' minds by the focus on COVID, itself the root cause of the current parlous economic situation.

Just how bad are economic conditions from the perspective of the U.S. public? Americans are somewhat less negative about the economy than in April when the full extent of the pandemic was first becoming evident, but the majority of Americans continue to rate the economy as ""poor"" or ""only fair,"" and the majority continue to say the economy is getting worse rather than getting better. These economic perceptions are much less positive than just before the pandemic, but still better than the low points reached during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.

President Donald Trump's approach to the economy centered on cutting taxes and cutting business regulations, although government spending for such things as defense, agricultural subsidies and pandemic relief soared during his administration. The Biden administration has proposed significantly more government intervention, with a specific focus on creating jobs, empowering unions, increasing taxes and supporting small businesses.

Biden-Harris Put a Big Focus on Creating More Jobs

Biden-Harris proposals relating to job creation include such things as ""immediately put people to work by enlisting them to help fight the pandemic, including through a Public Health Jobs Corps,"" ""mobilize American manufacturing and innovation to ensure that the future is made in America, and in all of America,"" ""mobilize American ingenuity to build a modern infrastructure and an equitable, clean energy future,"" and ""mobilize American talent and heart to build a 21st-century caregiving and education workforce.""

My review of public opinion on the economy over the years suggests that Americans are, in general, positive about any effort to create jobs. As I summarized last year, ""No one is going to criticize a politician for promising to create more jobs.""

Previous Gallup research shows that creating new jobs is the top recommendation Americans come up with when asked what can be done to fix the economy. Plus, we have historically noted widespread approval for proposals to do such things as ""provide tax incentives for companies to train workers to acquire new skills,"" ""provide $5.5 billion in federal dollars for job-training programs that would create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged young Americans,"" and ""spend more government money to encourage innovation and increase manufacturing jobs in the clean energy market."" And, research from a few years ago showed that Americans were very positive about the perceived effectiveness of ""providing new federal government programs designed to increase U.S. manufacturing jobs.""

The importance of creating (or maintaining) jobs is underscored by Gallup data showing that the significant majority of Americans at this point say it is not a good time to find a quality job. That is a little improved from the nadir reached in April, but still way more negative than the readings on this measure prior to the pandemic. Plus, workers are more worried than at any time in the past seven years about the possibility of their being laid off.

Public Favorable Toward Unions

The Biden-Harris economic plans include a significant emphasis on increased union involvement in the workforce, including ""passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, providing public service and federal government workers with bargaining rights, and taking other steps to make it easier for workers to organize unions and collectively bargain.""

The increased focus on unions fits well with Americans' views of unions in general. Gallup's latest update shows that about two-thirds of Americans approve of unions, even though relatively few are actually union members. Other questions show that support for more union activity is somewhat less positive, however. In 2018, Gallup found that 39% of Americans wanted the influence of unions to increase, while 26% wanted unions' influence to stay the same and 29% preferred unions have less influence. Pew Research, also in 2018, found that slightly more than half of Americans said the decreased number of workers who were union members was ""mostly bad for working people,"" while 35% said it was mostly good and the rest had no opinion.

Helping Small Businesses a Plus

Other proposals in the Biden-Harris economic priorities list include an emphasis on helping small businesses ""manage through the pandemic and recover, so that millions of entrepreneurs can get back on their feet and carry this economy forward"" and providing a ""comeback package for Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs.""

This emphasis on small businesses fits well with U.S. public opinion, given that Americans have more confidence in small business than in any other institution Gallup tests. And the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index shows that small-business owners themselves are much less optimistic than they were before the pandemic, underscoring the degree to which they can use government help.

The Biden-Harris proposals include increasing the federal minimum wage to at least $15 an hour -- again in sync with U.S. public opinion. A recent update from Pew Research shows that two-thirds of Americans favor an increase to a $15 minimum wage.

The Biden-Harris plan also invokes ""reversing some of Trump's tax cuts for corporations and imposing common-sense tax reforms that finally make sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share."" Americans generally support the idea of having wealthy individuals and corporations pay more in taxes. Last year, I looked in depth at the fact that less than half of Americans approved of the 2017 tax cut law, and other polling shows that most Americans do not think they have benefited from the law. In our latest update, 62% of Americans say that upper-income people pay too little in taxes, and 69% say that corporations pay too little.

Implications

All presidents want to improve the domestic economy and attempt to use the government in one way or another to bring about that eventuality. Trump pushed through a reduction in federal taxes and reduced government regulations as his major initiatives for improving the economy. The Biden-Harris administration appears poised to attempt (pending congressional cooperation) to use the government to improve the economy by increasing spending on a wide variety of programs designed to create jobs, sustain employment and provide pandemic relief. Certainly, there will be political pushback at these efforts to increase government intervention and expenditures, particularly if the Republicans maintain control of the Senate. But we know that the public supported the initial pandemic stimulus plan passed earlier this year, and a New York Times/Siena College poll in October showed that over seven in 10 favor a new $2 trillion stimulus package. More generally, the American public overall appears to be in sync with most aspects of what the Biden-Harris team is proposing related to the economy, suggesting that the new administration will begin its economic efforts with relatively solid public backing."

Joe Biden’s invocation of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, in the opening words of his convention acceptance speech, offered a flash of hope that, in broad terms, the Democratic nominee has grasped the scale of the Covid-19 crisis. Yet before Biden even spoke, the head of his transition team, former Sen. Ted Kaufman, undercut that hope, telling the Wall Street Journal that, in effect, Biden didn’t mean it. “When we get in, the pantry is going to be bare,” Kaufman said. “When you see what Trump’s done to the deficit … forget about Covid-19, all the deficits that he built with the incredible tax cuts. So we’re going to be limited.” After being called out by David Sirota, the Biden campaign split the difference: There will be “stimulus” in the short run, retrenchment later.

The reassurance is not reassuring. For, like the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force report on which the Democratic platform is based, it confirms that economic thinking on Team Biden, even among its most progressive elements, is essentially the same as that behind the Obama-Biden strategy for the previous economic crisis, from 2008 to 2009. But the underlying situation now is in many ways much more serious and intractable.

The 2008 crisis was, at its core, a financial one. It stemmed from a rash of financial frauds, which generated a simulacrum of economic growth through mortgage loans that would never be honored in full — and that were designed, and targeted, to ensure that they could never be honored in full. When the frauds were exposed and the housing market collapsed, millions lost their jobs; millions more lost their homes. Still, overall and over time, the crisis was amenable to the conventional “Keynesian” fix: a large injection of money. The residual arguments over the Obama-Biden program in 2009 are merely over whether the injection was large enough, and whether a larger one might have averted the political backlash that hit the administration in 2010.

Remarkably, although the recovery was slow and neither the labor force nor homeownership ever returned to pre-crisis levels, the United States was able to sustain an economic expansion after 2010. The position of the country was helped by an unexpected surge in low-cost natural gas and high-cost oil production. The expansion was continued, in the first three years of Donald Trump’s term, by large tax cuts weighted to the wealthy and a booming stock market — the “everything bubble” as it is sometimes called. The jobs created, it is true, were mainly at relatively low wages. Nevertheless, they were created. The U.S. returned to full employment, conventionally defined, by around 2018. This fact — a slow-motion success story — no doubt bolsters the confidence now of those who set the policy back then.

The next recovery will not be kickstarted by exports, by business investment, or by the purchases of durable consumer goods.

The long expansion relied very heavily on the consumer. While personal consumption had been the source of the pre-crisis boom, and fell sharply in the slump, its share of gross domestic product recovered after early 2015 and remained throughout well above levels of any previous post-war epoch. Total business investment, on the other hand, never returned to pre-crisis levels as a share of GDP and was at the peak in 2015 almost 2 percentage points below the previous peak in 2005, in part because the digital revolution reduced the cost of capital equipment and cut into the brick-and-mortar needs of the business sector. Government spending rose sharply in the slump and remained historically high, but as a share of GDP it declined continuously from the start of the expansion until 2020. Thus, consumer spending was the main sustaining factor for the five final years, until the pandemic hit.

There are three reasons why the experience of the last expansion will not be repeated now.

First, the pandemic has obliterated the global market for many advanced capital goods in which America excels. Aircraft are a major example. The civil aviation industry depends on worldwide demand, not U.S. demand, and world demand is dead so long as more airworthy planes are parked on the ground than are in the air. In a slightly different vein, the U.S. oil business turns on a world price. It is doomed so long as the selling price is half the cost of getting fracked oil from the ground in West Texas. Construction of offices and retail malls: also dead and done as a substantial share of clerical work shifts to the home office and of shopping to online distributors. The sale of automobiles will slow as commuting and shopping demand fewer miles of travel, and cars therefore last longer. In many other sectors, cheap digital equipment will replace expensive facilities and human labor. Overall, the next recovery will not be kickstarted by exports, by business investment, or by the purchases of durable consumer goods. There is nothing that Keynesian stimulus can do about that.

When we come to the consumer, there is an even bigger problem. It is that the largest share of increased spending in the last recovery — and the secret of American success at job creation — was not in the purchase of goods, but in the production and consumption of services. The U.S. economy after the crisis saw a vast growth in jobs in bars, restaurants, coffeehouses, hotels, resorts, spas and casinos, gyms, ride-shares, massage and tattoo parlors, hair and nail salons, boutique shops, and high-end grocery stores, as well as in child care, education, cultural events, and elective medical procedures — the entire panoply of services with which a wealthy society tends to pamper itself. In effect, the U.S. economy became a gigantic carnival of doing each other’s washing and scratching each other’s backs.

The pandemic has washed much of that away. Direct personal contact, crowded spaces, and mixing are the essence of many services and have been suppressed, necessarily, for health reasons — and will remain. There is an assumption, in many quarters, that if and when the pandemic recedes, these will simply return, and things will start up where they left off. This is neither a safe assumption nor even a reasonable one.

Back when most spending, at the margin, was for goods produced in American factories, the simple provision of money could flip the switch that got things going. Customers placed orders, businesses hired workers, and the engine started up. In an economy in which domestic spending is overwhelmingly directed at services, the jobs will not return until the customers, collectively, are willing to buy the services that they, themselves, collectively provide. But they will not be willing until they have the jobs, which depend on the prior presence of customers. This is a classic catch-22. It is precisely the dynamic — the virtuous circle — of self-reinforcing demand that the pandemic has obstructed and will continue to obstruct.

Even when the threat of the virus recedes — if it does recede — these services will not return easily for a more basic reason. They are generally not essential. They are add-ons that grew up with our wealth, and most Americans can, by and large, do without them. American households in the middle class and up live in houses, the byproduct of postwar policies of suburbanization and homeownership. If they have to, people who live in houses can cook, clean, and entertain themselves at home. In recent years, the economy grew by persuading them to leave home: to go out, to buy food, get exercise, and have fun on the market. The economy can and will retreat along the same lines, as families with incomes decide to spend less and save more, while those without incomes cut back on everything because they have to. It will retreat along those lines at least until the uncertainties of the pandemic start to recede. But the uncertainties can’t recede, so long as people who provide all those services do not first experience a sustained improvement in their prospect for jobs — and there, once again, is the catch.

The firms that provide the jobs cannot survive these conditions indefinitely. Service businesses generally operate with fixed costs, including rent and interest, that demand a high level of customer pass-through. Bars must be packed, restaurants full and noisy on the weekends, concerts sold out, or the businesses behind them cannot be sustained. The combination of public health restrictions on their capacity with high household savings and low patronage driven by economic insecurity is lethal to their prospects. A New York Times survey shows a falloff in August of almost 25 percent in visits to businesses compared to 2019, even though incomes have been kept up by relief programs. How long businesses can hold out is anyone’s guess. But many have given up already and many more will follow. And once a commercial strip or mall or neighborhood begins to go dark, blight weighs on the survivors. This is something we can see all around us right now.

Third, as the pandemic lingers and people cannot work, arrears for rent, mortgages, and utility bills are piling up. According to one survey, about a third of households failed to make their full rent or mortgage payment in July — for the fourth month in a row. Landlords have begun again to file for evictions — understandably from their point of view but disastrously for the economy as a whole. As the fear of eviction or foreclosure returns, households will save even more, and spend even less, hoping to have enough in reserve, in case of bad luck or sustained joblessness, to keep the bailiff from the door.

The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our economy for the long term. The changes are due to our advanced technology, not our backwardness; to our wealth, not our poverty; to our past access to credit and therefore, to our fixed commitments in relation to current incomes; to our houses and suburbs and cars; and to the fact that we have had, and still have, an affluent society. The decision, by millions of anxious Americans each acting in their own best interest — to eat and play at home, to save more and spend less, to protect their health and to hang on for as long as possible — creates an economic problem that cannot be palliated by money alone. This is not the postwar America of competitive consumerism and pent-up demand on which the magic of Maynard Keynes worked so well.

Something else must be done, going far beyond mere money. Or else, it’s depression all the way down.

The point of all the measures taken in April — the CARES Act, with extended unemployment benefits, payroll protection, small business loans, and direct payments to tax filers; and the Federal Reserve’s moves — was to buy time for social distancing and other measures to bring Covid-19 under control. The assumption was that the economy would then recover on its own. Even though the public health measures did not work, the funds did buy time for American households to pay rent, mortgages, utility bills, and (as it turned out) to put something aside for the summer and fall. They kept the country from falling apart as the pandemic spread. A new round of income supports can, of course, buy more time and is indeed urgent right now. But it will not, by itself, set the economy on a path toward renewed growth and high employment. Something else must be done, going far beyond mere money. Or else, it’s depression all the way down.

The outlines of that something else are only just coming into view. Some of the basic elements are the following:

1. The sectors producing advanced capital goods for world markets, energy for domestic use, weapons, and the construction sector must be mobilized, as if in a wartime effort, to a new set of purposes. These should aim at sustainable energy, mitigation of climate change, public health, and the reconstruction of life itself around safe and sustainable patterns of activity. Renewed infrastructure of all types, new transportation systems, new amenities, natural conservation, and cultural investments are all parts of this challenge. The Green New Deal is now doubly necessary, not only to transform the energy basis of the economy, but also to ensure that there is an economy to be transformed.

2. For the many millions who cannot find jobs in the private sector, there must be a job guarantee for all seeking to work, at a modest living wage, in the public sector. The pandemic has cut not only services jobs, but also office jobs and construction, so that nearly 40 million American workers have been displaced. Many will not be called back even if their employers survive. Yet there is work enough for everyone: in teaching, in caring, in public health, in parks and libraries, in art and culture, in maintaining our communities, and in providing food and housing and other basic services to those in need, and if the jobs are made available, people will sign up for them by the millions.

3. Service providers must be restructured so they can be sustained at reduced volumes. They must get loans on easy terms to reconfigure their physical layout to protect both customers and workers. But they also need assistance in meeting their costs. Cooperative private-public ownership and partial municipalization of service firms, with local government getting support from the federal government, is one promising path. In Germany, small businesses got a share of their costs covered by their localities, and so can survive, whereas in the U.S. they are failing.

4. Manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet the basic requirements of public health and sustenance must be rebuilt on domestic soil, so as to be immune from the disruptions to trade associated with the pandemic or other threats to global supply chains. We cannot be caught again, as we were this spring and summer, unable to provide basic protective equipment to health care workers and indeed to the whole population. For this purpose, a new structure of financing will be required, a Health Finance Corporation along the lines of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that operated from 1932 to 1956.

5. Public health must be reconstructed, accessible to all at no out-of-pocket cost. This call goes beyond the conventional discussion of public options and single-payer schemes to recognize that Covid-19 has created a financial crisis for America’s health care sector. Like everything else in America, health care is a business. And as the economy has fallen, reducing accidents and other infectious diseases, and as elective procedures have been postponed, providers are seeing fewer people, so that — like every other form of business — many hospitals and clinics cannot cover their costs. The solution is to make the health care sector cooperative, to assure that appropriate services are available to all. Indeed Spain and Ireland nationalized all health care services in the pandemic; America could do the same or find a less drastic solution.

6. For the duration and beyond, renters and mortgage holders must be shielded from evictions, foreclosures, and utility stoppages, consistent with good behavior supervised by local authorities, and there must be reasonable facilities to write down unpayable debts, along with reasonable compensation to small landlords. Student debt and medical debt are also good candidates for general relief.

7. Ultimately, since these debts are also the assets of those who lent the money, the reality is that a successful economy after Covid-19 requires a redistribution of financial wealth. If the pandemic is to be defeated, and if a viable social order is to emerge in the aftermath, the balance sheets of American households will have to be rewritten to carry a burden of debt that is manageable, given less market activity and lower market incomes. This means that the assets of the wealthy, as well as the debts of the overburdened, will have to be written down. There must be a general redistribution from creditors to debtors, reversing the trend of the past 40 years. The redistribution, by the way, will occur. It can be done through a decade of depression, as in the 1930s, or two decades of inflation, as in the 1960s, or it can be done by sensible restructuring and debt relief, as was done in the immediate aftermath of World War II.

8. Finally, with a widespread write-down of debts and assets, the financial sector must be restructured, since that sector holds many of the assets that will lose value. The ultimate financial consequences of this pandemic are not yet clear, and where the weak points of the financial system will emerge is still somewhat obscure. But it is certain that those weak points exist and when they are exposed, they will prove profound. The big banks that cannot make it can be taken over and run as public utilities; this can be done under present law. Necessary payments, savings, and credit functions can be sustained by providing public options, through postal banking and a public electronic payments system, managed by the Fed. Over time, regional and local banks can be supported to build a new economy in place of the one that Wall Street distorted and, ultimately, helped to destroy.

It is a delusion to think that markets will restore us to well-being on their own.

No spirit of radicalism animates these ideas. They are not driven by ideology nor by any past commitment to any agenda. They follow as matters of logic and fact from an understanding of the situation. The previous structure of the American economy was highly efficient in some ways. It supported, although unequally, a high living standard for a very large part of the population. But circumstances have changed in ways that cannot be controlled or reversed, and that will not evaporate on their own, whatever happens to the virus and the pandemic.

It is therefore a delusion to think that markets will restore us to well-being on their own. It is a delusion to think that the mere injection of money, however great and generous and however needed for the short run, will bring back the happy mix of jobs and incomes we’ve just lost. It is a delusion to think that the easy methods of the postwar economists, whose ideas have dominated liberal thought and response to economic crises for 70 years now, will work in the face of the Covid-19 challenge. The path forward requires planning and action on a far larger scale. It requires skills, imagination, local knowledge, commitment, and mobilization that resemble — but actually surpass — those brought to bear in the New Deal.

The only good news is that other unprecedented crises have happened before. In most cases, the result has been disaster. But there are a few moments in American history when the country rallied to do what was necessary, overcoming the odds, the powers, the old ideas, and the bad actors who stood in the way. It did so in 1861, in 1933, and in 1942. And here we are again.

Biden was right to invoke Roosevelt and the New Deal. America needs for him to mean it."

The largest increase – 15 points – came on confidence in Biden’s ability to bring the country closer together, a margin of 70% vs. 55%. Meanwhile, 66% have confidence in Biden to make good decisions about economic policy, up from 58% who said so in June. In an earlier survey this summer, Latino voters said the economy, health care and the coronavirus outbreak were three of the most important issues to their vote for president.

U.S. registered voters overall also express growing confidence on Biden on these issues, though the increases were more modest and confidence was lower than among Latino voters. For example, 57% of U.S. voters say they have confidence in Biden to handle the public health impact of the coronavirus outbreak, up from 52% in June.

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how Americans view the upcoming 2020 presidential election and the presidential candidates. For this analysis, we surveyed 11,929 U.S. adults, including 1,347 Hispanic registered voters, during the last week of September and the first week of October 2020. The survey was in the field when Trump announced, early on the morning of Oct. 2, that he and first lady Melania Trump had contracted COVID-19. Estimates of Hispanic eligible voters in battleground states are based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey provided through Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) from the University of Minnesota. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.

Latino voters have significantly less confidence in Trump on these issues. Fewer than half say they are somewhat or very confident that he can handle the five issues, with views on most largely unchanged since summer. Only about three-in-ten Latino voters (29%) say they are confident that Trump can handle the health impact of the coronavirus outbreak. A higher share (44%) are confident that Trump can make good decisions about economic policy. Notably, a declining share of Latino voters say they have confidence that the president can bring the country closer together – 20% in October, down from 28% in June.

Among all U.S. voters, confidence in Trump on these issues is also mostly unchanged, though Americans overall have more confidence in the president than Latino voters. Four-in-ten U.S. registered voters (40%) say they have confidence in Trump to handle the health impact of COVID-19, and 30% have confidence that Trump can bring the country closer together. These shares are little changed from June.

A record 32 million Hispanics are projected to be eligible to vote in 2020, a total that for the first time exceeds the number of Black eligible voters in a presidential election. Hispanic voter turnout has historically lagged that of other groups, though turnout spiked among Hispanics and other groups for the 2018 midterms and approached levels normally seen during presidential election years. Even so, Hispanics made up only 8% of all voters in 2018, compared with 10% in 2016. (Explore our interactive maps and tables to see Latino eligible voters by state and congressional district.)

Biden leads among Hispanic voters

Biden holds a 34-point advantage over Trump among Latino eligible voters, far larger than Biden’s 10-point lead among all U.S. voters. In the new survey, 63% of Latino voters say they would vote for Biden or lean toward voting for him if the election were held today, while 29% say they would vote for Trump or lean toward voting for him. In 2016, Latino voters had similar preferences, according to exit polls and a Pew Research Center study of validated voters.

Among Hispanic voters, a higher share of college graduates than those with some college experience or less say they favor Biden, 69% vs. 61%. Meanwhile, 67% of Hispanic women voters and 59% of registered Hispanic men say they prefer Biden.

More Latino voters who support Biden say their choice is more of a vote against Trump than it is a vote for Biden, 59% vs. 40%.

At the same time, Hispanic voters who back Biden are sure about their choice, with 86% saying they are certain they will vote for him – similar to the share among all U.S. voters who support Biden. However, only 57% of Hispanic voters who prefer Biden say they are extremely motivated to vote, a lower share than among the 72% of Biden supporters nationwide.

Hispanic voters in battleground states

Biden holds a narrower lead over Trump (54% vs. 37%) among Latino registered voters in nine “battleground” states – Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Stronger Hispanic support for Trump in battleground states reflects the group’s large population in Florida, where Cuban Americans have helped shape a Hispanic electorate that leans more Republican than Hispanic voters nationwide.

The nine battleground states together have more than 6.3 million Hispanic eligible voters – defined as adult U.S. citizens – and Florida alone (3.1 million) accounts for half of the total. The next largest state is Arizona, with nearly 1.2 million Hispanic eligible voters. In both states, Hispanics make up a fifth or more of all eligible voters – 20% in Florida and 24% in Arizona.

The remaining battleground states, with a combined 2 million Hispanic eligible voters, have smaller but still notable Hispanic electorates. For example, Pennsylvania (521,000), Michigan (261,000) and Wisconsin (183,000) each have sizable numbers of Hispanic eligible voters that can play a role in swinging close elections. In 2016, the presidential contests in these states were decided by a combined total of 77,744 votes.

Impact of COVID-19 on Hispanics

The coronavirus has disproportionately harmed the personal finances of Hispanics, with Hispanic women experiencing the largest job losses of any racial or ethnic group, regardless of gender. About half of Hispanics (53%) say they or someone in their household has been laid off or taken a pay cut because of COVID-19, compared with 42% of all U.S. adults. Since the outbreak started in February, significant shares of Hispanics say they have used money from savings or retirement funds to pay bills (43%), had trouble paying bills (37%), gotten food from a food bank (30%) or had problems paying their rent or mortgage (26%).

Latinos have also experienced disproportionate health impacts from COVID-19. As of mid-August, about one-in-five Latino adults (22%) said they have had a positive coronavirus test (7%) or were “pretty sure” they have had it (15%). By contrast, 14% of all U.S. adults said they have had a positive test (3%) or were pretty sure they have had the virus (11%).

In the new survey, the Hispanic voter groups most confident that Biden can handle the public health impact of the coronavirus outbreak include women (80%) and college graduates (79%). By contrast, lower shares of Hispanic male voters (61%) and Hispanic voters with some college education or less (68%) say they are somewhat or very confident in Biden.

Hispanic voters have far less confidence in Trump’s ability to handle COVID-19, though there are some differences by education. Especially low shares of Hispanic voters who are college graduates (22%) say they have confidence in Trump to handle the public health impact of the coronavirus outbreak, compared with 31% of those with some college education or less. Meanwhile, 26% of Hispanic women voters and 33% of Hispanic male voters have confidence in Trump to handle the outbreak.

Few Latinos view the economy as good, although there is optimism for the future

Roughly three-in-ten Latino registered voters (29%) rate economic conditions in the country as excellent or good, up from 20% in June, but lower than the 35% of all U.S. voters who say so. For Latino voters, the share remains far below the 49% who gave a positive rating to U.S. economic conditions in January, about two months before President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 due to COVID-19.

Hispanic male voters have a more positive view of the nation’s economy than Hispanic women voters, 34% vs. 23%. Differences also exist by education among Hispanic voters, with 31% of those with some college education or less rating the economy as excellent or good, compared with 22% of college graduates.

Among Biden supporters, only 14% of Latino voters rate the U.S. economy as excellent or good.

Hispanics have some optimism about the future of the economy. About half of Hispanic voters (53%) say they expect economic conditions will be better a year from now, while 30% say conditions will be about the same and 16% say they will worsen.

Older Hispanics have more optimism on this measure than younger Hispanics. About six-in-ten (60%) Hispanic voters ages 50 and older say U.S. economic conditions will be better a year from now, compared with about half (48%) of Hispanic voters ages 18 to 49. Somewhat similar shares of men (57%) and women (49%) among Hispanic voters say economic conditions will have improved in a year. There was no difference by education levels among Hispanic voters, with about half of college graduates and those with some college experience or less saying the economic conditions will be better in a year.

Most Latino voters say they are ‘fearful’ about the state of the nation

Roughly two-thirds of Latino registered voters (68%) say they are fearful about the state of the nation. Meanwhile, 45% of Latino voters say they are hopeful. These views are similar to those reported in June, and similar to those among U.S. voters overall. Latino voters across demographic groups express similar levels of fear when thinking about the state of the country. By contrast, levels of hope for the country among Latino voters vary by gender and education levels.

About half of Hispanic men registered to vote (51%) say they feel hopeful about the state of the country, compared with only 36% of Hispanic women voters. Meanwhile, 37% of Hispanic voters with a bachelor’s degree or more say the feel hopeful, while 47% of Hispanic voters with some college experience or less say the same.

Among Biden supporters, 79% of Latino voters say they feel fearful about the state of the country. Meanwhile, 36% say they feel hopeful.

Latinos voters also had negative views about the nation’s direction. Only one-in-five (21%) say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country today, a similar share to June (19%) but down from 32% in December 2019.

The results of the biannual survey, conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, project the highest youth turnout in a dozen years, with 63 percent of respondents saying they will “definitely” be voting in November. During the last election in 2016, that number was just 47 percent.

“More than 15 million young Americans have turned 18 since the last presidential election. The Gen-Z generation is facing a once-in-a-lifetime experience of a global pandemic, economic instability, and racial reckoning,” says Institute of Politics Director Mark Gearan. “Young Americans are seeing firsthand how their government impacts their day-to-day lives, and they are ready to make their voice heard in this election.”

In the race for president, voters aged 18-29 favor Joe Biden over Donald Trump by more than a two-to-one margin—60 percent for Biden versus 27 percent for Trump. Young voters are also unhappy with the current administration’s handling of the economy, with 34 percent saying they trust Trump on the economy while 42 percent say they trust Biden.

Yet nearly a quarter of young voters surveyed (23 percent) said they trusted neither Biden or Trump on the economy, and the survey results suggest sharply increased concern among young voters about economic issues in the COVID-19 pandemic era.

The economy was just the fifth highest issue of concern in the spring 2020 poll, as only 6 percent of young voters listed it as their top issue. In the current poll, however, the state of the economy shot up to rank number one among young voters’ concern, with 23 percent saying it was their most important issue.

""Young Americans today find themselves on the frontlines of the triple crises of COVID. Their education has been disrupted, job prospects falter, and communities are experiencing a racial reckoning causing constant concern about their daily livelihoods and the well-being of their friends and their families,” said Harvard College junior Justin Tseng, chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project. “Young voters are tuning in and facing our nation’s challenges head first. Don’t be surprised when they turn out at the polls in historic numbers.""

Young Trump supporters say they are more enthusiastic about their candidate, with 44 percent saying they are “very enthusiastic” about voting for their choice, versus 30 percent for Biden.

Despite the apparent enthusiasm gap, Biden’s overall support advantage among young voters exceeds Hillary Clinton’s in 2016, his own performance in the Spring 2020 Youth Poll, and even President Obama’s performance in 2008. In that poll, 59 percent of young voters supported Obama, while 30 percent supported Republican John McCain.

On non-election issues, the young voters surveyed supported peaceful, COVID-safe protests and demonstrations (74 percent) to protests involving violence and destruction of property (9 percent).

The survey respondents broke along partisan lines on the issue of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 39 percent of self-identified Democrats saying they would “definitely” get vaccinated, and 7 percent saying they would “definitely not.” Among Republicans, however, just 14 percent of those surveyed said they would “definitely” get vaccinated, while 26 percent said they would “definitely not.”

The full results of the Fall 2020 Harvard Youth Poll will be released in October."

But Biden, in remarks to reporters in Wilmington, Del, also warned that a single stimulus package wouldn’t provide nearly enough to help the nation through the crisis.

""The fight against Covid won't be won in January,"" he said.

While Biden said he was “encouraged” by the recent progress in talks over a bipartisan Senate bill, he also warned that “there’s no time to lose” in reaching a deal.

“This situation is urgent. If we don’t act now, the future will be very bleak,” Biden said.

“The country is going to be in dire, dire, dire straits,” if lawmakers can’t get a deal done, he added.

Biden's remarks came just hours after federal data showedthat a modest recovery of the U.S. economy had stalled amid a severe resurgence of the coronavirus. The U.S. economy added just 245,000 jobs in November, as the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had predicted the economy would gain around 440,000 jobs.

Biden, during his remarks, also suggested Americans should expect a scaled-down inauguration in January, and said he wouldn’t make Covid-19 vaccines mandatory.

""I don't think it should be mandatory,” he said, “but I would do everything in my power, just like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide, do everything in my power as president to encourage people to do the right thing.""

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump had no public events on his schedule Friday. Vice President Mike Pence, however, is traveling to Georgia on Friday for an afternoon rally with incumbent GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face a Jan. 5 runoff election.

At the same time, former President Barack Obama and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams are headlining a dueling rally for the state's Democratic Senate candidates, Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock.

Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday that he accepted Biden's offer to serve as his chief medical adviser. Asked in an interview on NBC's ""TODAY"" show whether he would do it, Fauci said, ""Oh absolutely. I said yes right on the spot, yeah."" He will also stay in his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases after Biden asked him to continue in his administration.

In a joint interview with Harris Thursday on CNN, Biden also said he'd be ""happy"" to get publicly vaccinated if Fauci says it is safe. He also said that after he is inaugurated, he will ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days to help fight the spread of the coronavirus as vaccines are distributed.

Biden also told CNN that he thought the latest reports about Trump contemplating pardons for his children could set a bad precedent for future presidents.

Speaking about how he could work with Congress, Biden also said a number of Senate Republicans have privately congratulated him on his victory. The president-elect acknowledged the predicament the GOP senators find themselves in given that Trump has a strong base that could jeopardize support for the senators if they make the wrong move."

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said in a speech from the White House streamed online by economic clubs around the country that the economy was the strongest on record before the coronavirus pandemic, again promising vigorous economic growth if he is given another four years in office. He also sought to stir up fear about what a victory by Joe Biden and other Democrats would mean for the U.S.

""The policies of the left would unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions,"" Mr. Trump said, claiming that a Democratic win would lead to sharply higher taxes and ""destroy our country.""

""We will go into depression,"" the president said.

Less growth than advertised

Economists do not echo Mr. Trump's prediction of doom. Last month, an economic forecast from Moody's predicted that Biden's economic plan would result in ""more jobs, a stronger economy and higher incomes for the middle class"" than Trump's.

In fact, economic growth under Mr. Trump has fallen short of what he promised four years ago. Instead of rising 3.5% annually, the country's gross domestic product in the first three years of his term has risen by an average of 2.6%. Battered by the fallout from COVID-19, employers also have cut 10.5 million jobs in the past six months. Even before the pandemic, however, annual job growth never reached 2.5 million and dropped by nearly 200,000 in 2019.

On Wednesday Mr. Trump said that the economy was recovering jobs lost during the lockdowns 23 times faster than in the recovery that followed the Great Recession. He also predicted the economy would add 10 million jobs in the first six months of 2021. That pace of hiring would lift employment roughly back to where it was pre-pandemic by the middle next year.

Mr. Trump also touted his success on trade, saying he had replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, ended the Transpacific Partnership and negotiated better trade terms with China.

""If I don't get elected … China will own the United States,"" Mr. Trump said.

No word on stimulus checks or jobless aid

Notably absent from Mr. Trump's speech was any mention of another round of fiscal stimulus. Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on the need for more government spending to help speed the recovery.

In a response to a question after the speech, Mr. Trump said he favors more stimulus money for certain industries, like the airlines. But he said nothing about another round of cash payments to Americans or restarting enhanced unemployment benefits.

Last week, Mr. Trump called off talks over a spending bill with Democrats, but on Tuesday he tweeted his support for significant stimulus spending, urging Congress to ""go big or go home."""

Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

The 2020 presidential campaign has been repeatedly rocked by seismic events – from the outbreak of a devastating pandemic to President Donald Trump contracting COVID-19. Yet in at least two important respects, not much has changed: Joe Biden continues to hold sizable advantages over Trump on most major issues and key personal traits, as well as in overall voter preferences. And voters continue to be highly focused on the election and attach great importance to its outcome.

With less than a month to go before the election, a majority of registered voters (57%) say they are very or somewhat confident in Biden to handle the public health impact of the coronavirus, while 40% express a similar level of confidence in Trump. In June, Biden held a narrower, 11 percentage point lead on handling the coronavirus outbreak (52% Biden, 41% Trump).

At a time of deep political divisions and partisan antipathy, voters are far more likely to express confidence in Biden than Trump to unify the country. Half of voters (50%) say they are confident in Biden to “bring the country closer together,” compared with just 30% who express confidence in Trump.

The new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 30-Oct. 5 among 11,929 U.S. adults, including 10,543 registered voters, finds that Biden maintains an overall lead in voter preferences: 52% of registered voters say if the election were held today, they would vote for Biden or lean toward voting for him, while 42% support or lean toward voting for Trump. Another 4% of voters back Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, while 1% support Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins in the 2020 election. (See detailed tables for full demographic breaks on voter preferences.)

The survey was in the field when Trump announced on Twitter, early on the morning of Oct. 2, that he and first lady Melania Trump had contracted COVID-19. There are no significant differences in voter preferences, or in confidence in the two candidates to handle the impact of the coronavirus, before and after his announcement.

Trump’s handling of the nation’s economy remains a relative strong point. About half of voters (52%) express confidence in Trump to make good decisions about economic policy, one the highest shares expressing confidence in the president on any of the six issues on the survey. However, about as many voters (51%) have confidence in Biden on the economy.

Since summer, there has been some improvement in views of the nation’s economy. Among all voters, 35% say economic conditions are excellent or good, up from 28% in June. However, this change has come almost entirely among Trump supporters. And the gap in economic perceptions, already wide, has grown much wider. Two-thirds (67%) of Trump supporters now say that economic conditions are excellent or good, compared with 51% who said this in June. Just 11% of Biden supporters view economic conditions positively, which is little changed from four months ago (9%).

The survey finds that voters view Biden much more positively than Trump for compassion, honesty and being a good role model. Nearly twice as many voters say “compassionate” describes Biden very or fairly well than say it applies to Trump (67% vs. 34%). More than half of voters (53%) say Biden is honest, compared with 35% who describe Trump as honest. And far more voters say Biden is a good role model (54% vs. 28%).

The gap is narrower on other personal attributes. Biden holds a narrow 6-point edge in “courageous” (54% Biden, 48% Trump); slightly more say Trump than Biden is mentally sharp (50% Trump, 46% Biden). Among six personal traits included, Trump holds his widest edge in standing up for his beliefs: 69% say this describes Trump very or fairly well, compared with 61% who say it describes Biden well.

The share of Biden supporters who back him strongly has increased since August, though he still trails Trump in strong support. A 57% majority of voters who favor Biden say they support him strongly. Biden drew strong backing from fewer than half of his supporters (46%) two months ago. About two-thirds of those who back Trump (68%) say they support him strongly.

As was the case in the summer, voters’ preferences – regardless of whom they favor – remain very much centered on Trump. Just 36% of Biden voters view their vote more as an expression of support for the former vice president; 63% view it as vote against Trump. By contrast, 71% of Trump supporters say their vote is a vote for Trump. These views have changed only modestly since June.

The supporters of both candidates remain highly engaged in the election. Identical shares of registered voters who favor Trump and Biden (71% each) say they have given a lot of thought to the candidates running for president. And nearly eight-in-ten voters (78%) – again, comparable majorities of both candidates’ supporters – say it “really matters” who wins.

While voters on both sides share a sense of the importance of the election, they also share concern about the country’s future if the opposing candidate wins. Fully 89% of Trump supporters say that if Biden wins, they not only would be very concerned over the country’s direction, they believe it would lead to “lasting harm” for the country. A nearly identical majority of Biden supporters (90%) say Trump’s election would result in lasting harm to the United States.

And voters who support both Trump and Biden say their differences extend beyond policies to disagreements over core values. Overwhelming shares of voters who support each candidate say that, when asked to think about those who favor their opposing candidate, they not only have different views on politics and policies, they also have “fundamental disagreements on core American values and goals.”

Roughly eight-in-ten of those who support Biden (80%) and Trump (77%) say they fundamentally disagree about core values; only about one-in-five say their differences are limited to politics and policies.

However, there is a widespread sense among voters that if their candidate wins the election, the next president should primarily focus on the concerns of all Americans, not just those who voted for him. This view – like the belief that the country may face lasting harm if the opposing candidate wins – is shared widely among the supporters of both candidates. Fully 89% of Biden supporters and 86% of Trump supporters say that if their candidate is victorious, he should focus primarily on the concerns of all Americans, even if it means disappointing some of his supporters."

He pledged to look beyond red and blue and to discard the harsh rhetoric that characterizes our political debates.

It will be a difficult struggle. Americans have rarely been as polarized as they are today.

The studies we’ve conducted at Pew Research Center over the past few years illustrate the increasingly stark disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on the economy, racial justice, climate change, law enforcement, international engagement and a long list of other issues. The 2020 presidential election further highlighted these deep-seated divides. Supporters of Biden and Donald Trump believe the differences between them are about more than just politics and policies. A month before the election, roughly eight-in-ten registered voters in both camps said their differences with the other side were about core American values, and roughly nine-in-ten – again in both camps – worried that a victory by the other would lead to “lasting harm” to the United States.

The U.S. is hardly the only country wrestling with deepening political fissures. Brexit has polarized British politics, the rise of populist parties has disrupted party systems across Europe, and cultural conflict and economic anxieties have intensified old cleavages and created new ones in many advanced democracies. America and other advanced economies face many common strains over how opportunity is distributed in a global economy and how our culture adapts to growing diversity in an interconnected world.

But the 2020 pandemic has revealed how pervasive the divide in American politics is relative to other nations. Over the summer, 76% of Republicans (including independents who lean to the party) felt the U.S. had done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared with just 29% of those who do not identify with the Republican Party. This 47 percentage point gap was the largest gap found between those who support the governing party and those who do not across 14 nations surveyed. Moreover, 77% of Americans said the country was now more divided than before the outbreak, as compared with a median of 47% in the 13 other nations surveyed.

Much of this American exceptionalism preceded the coronavirus: In a Pew Research Center study conducted before the pandemic, Americans were more ideologically divided than any of the 19 other publics surveyed when asked how much trust they have in scientists and whether scientists make decisions solely based on facts. These fissures have pervaded nearly every aspect of the public and policy response to the crisis over the course of the year. Democrats and Republicans differ over mask wearing, contact tracing, how well public health officials are dealing with the crisis, whether to get a vaccine once one is available, and whether life will remain changed in a major way after the pandemic. For Biden supporters, the coronavirus outbreak was a central issue in the election – in an October poll, 82% said it was very important to their vote. Among Trump supporters, it was easily the least significant among six issues tested on the survey: Just 24% said it was very important.

Why is America cleaved in this way? Once again, looking across other nations gives us some indication. The polarizing pressures of partisan media, social media, and even deeply rooted cultural, historical and regional divides are hardly unique to America. By comparison, America’s relatively rigid, two-party electoral system stands apart by collapsing a wide range of legitimate social and political debates into a singular battle line that can make our differences appear even larger than they may actually be. And when the balance of support for these political parties is close enough for either to gain near-term electoral advantage – as it has in the U.S. for more than a quarter century – the competition becomes cutthroat and politics begins to feel zero-sum, where one side’s gain is inherently the other’s loss. Finding common cause – even to fight a common enemy in the public health and economic threat posed by the coronavirus – has eluded us.

Over time, these battles result in nearly all societal tensions becoming consolidated into two competing camps. As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become “stacked” on top of people’s partisan identities. Race, religion and ideology now align with partisan identity in ways that they often didn’t in eras when the two parties were relatively heterogenous coalitions. In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is “especially multifaceted.” According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound. It is hard to find another example of polarization in the world,” they write, “that fuses all three major types of identity divisions in a similar way.”

Of course, there’s nothing wrong with disagreement in politics, and before we get nostalgic for a less polarized past it’s important to remember that eras of relatively muted partisan conflict, such as the late 1950s, were also characterized by structural injustice that kept many voices – particularly those of non-White Americans – out of the political arena. Similarly, previous eras of deep division, such as the late 1960s, were far less partisan but hardly less violent or destabilizing. Overall, it’s not at all clear that Americans are further apart from each other than we’ve been in the past, or even that we are more ideologically or affectively divided – that is, exhibiting hostility to those of the other party – than citizens of other democracies. What’s unique about this moment – and particularly acute in America – is that these divisions have collapsed onto a singular axis where we find no toehold for common cause or collective national identity.

Americans both see this problem and want to address it. Overwhelming majorities of both Trump (86%) and Biden (89%) supporters surveyed this fall said that their preferred candidate, if elected, should focus on addressing the needs of all Americans, “even if it means disappointing some of his supporters.”

In his speech, President-elect Biden vowed to “work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me as those who did” and called on “this grim era of demonization in America” to come to an end. That’s a sentiment that resonates with Americans on both sides of the fence. But good intentions on the part of our leaders and ourselves face serious headwinds in a political system that reinforces a two-party political battleground at nearly every level."

The group includes Yellen, who if confirmed would be the first woman to serve as treasury secretary; Neera Tanden, as his choice to lead his Office of Management and Budget; Cecilia Rouse as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo as deputy treasury secretary; and Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey as members of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Biden has been rolling out his top administration picks, including Tuesday's slate, in the weeks since the election, even as President Donald Trump refuses to concede. Speaking from Wilmington, Delaware, alongside the team, as well as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Biden promised they would deliver relief to working Americans.

“I know times are tough, but I want to let you know that help is on the way,” Biden said. He reiterated promises that his economic goals would focus on providing access to affordable health care, child care, sick leave and family leave, and investing in infrastructure and clean energy, and he called on Congress to pass a “robust” Covid-19 relief package.

Biden singled out Yellen as someone who had “spent her career” focusing on “the dignity of work, which is really important to me” and lauded Tanden as a “brilliant policy mind.""

Yellen, during her own brief remarks, addressed the American people directly, pledging that the Department of the Treasury, if she is confirmed as its leader, would spend its energy “thinking about you, your jobs, your paychecks, your struggles, your hopes, your dignity and your limitless potential.”

Yellen previously served as chair of the Federal Reserve during the Obama administration. In addition to other roles she held at the Federal Reserve, Yellen also served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton.

Earlier in the day, Biden and Harris each separately received the presidential daily briefing, which they began getting Monday.

Biden's top choice for director of the National Economic Council is Brian Deese, a former adviser to President Barack Obama. The president-elect is expected to make the announcement later this week, when he will also name his Domestic Policy Council director, two sources familiar with the matter said Monday. Deese was part of the Obama administration team that worked on both environmental issues and the bailout of the auto industry.

According to a readout released Monday night, Biden and Harris met virtually with national security and climate policy staff to discuss their wide-ranging agenda, which will include rejoining the Paris Agreement on Biden’s first day in office.

Leading GOP senators are still reluctant to publicly accept Biden’s victory and are pointing to Dec. 14, when the Electoral College meets, as the day when they would acknowledge his win. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, on Monday called Tanden, Biden’s choice for Office of Management and Budget director, “radioactive” and said there should have been “at least some consultation” with Republicans on the decision.

Trump and Pence will be hosting a Covid-19 “summit” at the White House on Dec. 8 to bring together attendees from invited organizations including Pfizer, Moderna, FedEx, Walgreens, McKesson, CVS and UPS, among others, a White House official confirmed Tuesday.

Trump, meanwhile, has no public events on his daily White House schedule.

He called into an hourslong meeting Monday that his campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis held with some Arizona Republican state legislators to push a number of unfounded conspiracy theories aimed at undermining the election results in Arizona and other battleground states Trump lost. The president spent the call trashing Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, for signing the certification of Biden as the winner of Arizona’s election."

Joe Biden came out swinging against President Donald Trump's record on the economy Thursday, hours after new data showed the U.S. suffered its worst quarterly downturn in history in the midst of the spreading coronavirus pandemic.

""The depth of economic devastation our nation is experiencing is not an act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership,"" the presumptive Democratic nominee for president said in a statement released by his campaign. ""Had President Trump taken immediate and decisive action, tens of thousands of lives and millions of jobs would never have been lost.""

Data released by the Department of Commerce earlier in the day showed that U.S. gross domestic product plunged 32.9% between April and June on an annualized basis, the sharpest drop on record. GDP is a broad measure of all the goods and services produced in a country.

A separate Labor Department report showed that more than 1.4 million Americans filed initial jobless claims last week, rising for a second week and marking the 19th consecutive week with initial claims greater than 1 million.

The bleak economic numbers, which turned out to be slightly better than forecast, reflected the fact that much of the U.S. was put under lockdown beginning in March in order to slow the spread of Covid-19. The disease has so far killed more than 150,000 people in the United States."

Biden accused the U.S. leader, his Republican opponent in the November 3 national election, of being “focused solely” on how the stock market is faring, even as nearly 50 million workers have been laid off in the past four months. Trump frequently tweets favorable comments on days when the market has soared and says the country is headed to better economic times in the second half of 2020 and into 2021.

Biden told workers at a metal products factory in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, that Trump does not care about them, “not you, your families.” He said if he wins the election and assumes office next January, “I’ll be laser-focused on working families, not the wealthy investor class.”

He said Trump had made “big promises” to add manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and repair the country’s deteriorating infrastructure.

“What happened to all that?” Biden asked.

Biden’s scathing assessment of Trump’s performance on the economy came as he unveiled a $700 billion manufacturing plan that he said would add 5 million new jobs to help blunt the country’s economic turmoil wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden toured the metalworks facility and then outlined his “Build Back Better” proposal that places a premium on national government procurement of American-made products.

Biden, the Democrats’ presumptive nominee in the election for a four-year term in the White House, leads Trump in national polls and in key battleground states such as Pennsylvania. But the surveys also narrowly show voters think Trump, a real estate and golf resort entrepreneur before winning the 2016 presidential election, is best suited to handle economic issues.

Biden said his plan includes $300 billion for research and development projects in clean energy, telecommunications, artificial intelligence and other fields. It also includes $400 billion for the government purchase of U.S.-built goods, such as environmentally clean products and construction materials.

Before the speech, one of his aides said, “This is no time to just build back to the way things were before, with the economy’s same old structural weaknesses and inequality still in place.” The aide said Biden believes it is “a moment to imagine and build a new American economy for our families and next generation.”

Biden’s campaign said it hopes the plan will “power new demand for American products, materials and services and ensure that they are shipped on U.S.-flagged cargo carriers” if they are exported to foreign countries.

Any companies receiving government aid under the plan would be required to commit to a $15 minimum wage for its workers, paid leave and the guaranteed option to join a union.

Biden’s campaign said the promise of U.S. government purchases would encourage businesses to boost hiring at a time the U.S. has fallen into a coronavirus-caused recession. Millions of workers have been laid off from jobs as the number of new coronavirus infections has been increasing by the day to a total of more than 62,000 on Wednesday, a new one-day peak.

In addition to the new jobs spending, Biden hopes to tighten rules on what products can be designated “made in America” and therefore qualify for government procurement.

Biden plans in future speeches to spell out plans for developing clean energy and sustainable infrastructure, building up a workforce of caregivers and educators, and advancing racial equity in the aftermath of coast-to-coast protests against police abuse of minorities."

“I’m letting them know that America is back,” Biden said after winning the November election, describing his conversations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other heads of state who called to congratulate him on his victory. “We’re going to be back in the game.”

What that comeback should look like, exactly, is being hotly debated in foreign policy circles as Biden prepares to take over as commander in chief on Jan. 20.

Biden has drawn praise for pledging to restore multilateralism as a central tenet in U.S. foreign policy. Trump’s frequent criticism of close U.S. allies, friendly relationships with autocratic rulers, and withdrawal from agreements like the Paris climate accord were widely viewed as a threat to the post-World War II international order.

But Biden’s nominees for senior foreign policy and national security posts have acknowledged the world has changed during Trump’s presidency, and that a turn-back-the-clock reset on relations with Iran, China, Russia and other adversaries is simply not possible.

After four years of Trump, who argued that other nations have taken advantage of America in a globalized economy that hurts U.S. workers, it’s also no longer a given that most Americans want the United States to play a lead role in promoting peace and economic prosperity around the world.

The traditional “paradigm of U.S. foreign policy — American leadership, alliances, promoting rules-based order — all of that is sort of not embraced by average Americans” as much as it once was, said Andrew Weiss, a former senior National Security Council official under former President Bill Clinton.

“Some benefits of that engagement didn’t trickle down to key parts of our country,” said Michael Leiter, who served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center from 2007 to 2011. “The death of manufacturing in the Midwest wasn’t driven purely by NAFTA and global engagement. But it was a byproduct.”

Biden has made the connection between domestic economic growth and national security a cornerstone of his foreign policy plans. The view has also been embraced by Jake Sullivan, Biden’s pick for national security adviser, who has written and spoken extensively on the topic.

“The alliances we rebuild, the institutions we lead, the agreements we sign, all of them should be judged by a basic question: Will this make life better, easier, safer for families across this country?” Sullivan said last month when Biden officially announced his foreign policy team.

Still, Biden cannot delay action on a host of global challenges while he works to shore up a U.S. economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Biden will need to redefine American leadership abroad while simultaneously addressing the domestic economic and public health crisis, said John McLaughlin, a former senior CIA official.

Biden will have “a lot of messaging to do here about why it serves American interests to be engaged in the world. It’s a hard job to get that point across,” said McLaughlin, who served as the CIA’s deputy director and acting director under former President George W. Bush. “His priorities are, to a degree, to remove the ambiguity and confusion in the world about whether the United States is going to lead or not. And if we are, how?”

As president, Biden will right away confront some of the most vexing U.S. foreign policy problems.

Winding down the war in Afghanistan

On Afghanistan, the U.S.-Taliban accord signed in Doha last February paved the way for a full withdrawal of American and other foreign troops by May 2021, if the Taliban insurgency and Afghan government reach a ceasefire agreement and meet other conditions.

But in a statement this month, Taliban leaders said they did not believe the troop withdrawal deadline laid out in the accord was based on preconditions. Experts following America’s longest war said the Taliban position could complicate the peace talks going forward under Biden.

“Biden will face an immediate decision point because, according to the Doha agreement with the Taliban, we’re supposed to withdraw our troops by May 1st. That’s only 14 weeks after Biden’s inauguration,” said Barnett Rubin, who served as a senior adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan under former President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013.

Last month, the Trump administration announced plans to reduce the current number of roughly 4,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 2,500 by Jan. 15. The administration also said it would lower the U.S. troop level in Iraq to 2,500 from 3,000 by mid-January, just days before Biden is set to take office.

The announcement was praised by some Democrats but criticized by Republicans, setting the stage for a fresh debate over America’s presence in the region that has bedeviled the past three administrations.

Biden has been on both sides of the debate. As a senator he voted to go to war in Iraq, and he opposed a troop surge in Afghanistan when he served as vice president. As president, Biden will find there is little the U.S. can do to change the outcome in Afghanistan, said Rubin, who credited the Trump administration for starting the peace talks. “We’ve already passed our peak. We will not be able to accomplish more than we’ve already accomplished,” he said.

Biden will face a ‘changed world’ on North Korea, Middle East

Biden may also be forced to confront North Korea in his first months in office. Dating back to the George W. Bush years, North Korea has timed nuclear and long-range missile tests to coincide with post-election periods in the U.S. or the first months of a new administration.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could take a similar tack to test Biden, coming after a period in which he enjoyed an unusually close relationship with the U.S. under Trump.

“North Korea really ratchets things up and puts pressure on the U.S. early in an administration,” said Sung-Yoon Lee, an expert on U.S.-North Korea relations who teaches at Tufts University. “It’s far more likely than not that North Korea would follow in that pattern and put pressure on a Biden admin with a weapons test” during his first months in office, he said.

But the Biden administration will have less leverage to pressure North Korea to denuclearize than the U.S. did before Trump took office. Trump and Kim held two summits over the past four years but failed to reach an agreement.

Meanwhile, North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear weapons program under Trump’s watch. Biden will have trouble forcing Kim to change course without support from China, and help from the Chinese is unlikely, North Korea watchers said.

The Iran nuclear deal and Israeli-Palestinian conflict offer other examples of foreign policy issues that have changed significantly since Biden and Obama left office in early 2017.

Biden has pledged to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from in 2018. Sullivan said at a forum earlier this month that the goal of convincing Iran — which has continued building its nuclear weapons capacity under Trump — to accept the terms of the original 2015 deal was “realistic and achievable.”

But Sullivan and other senior officials on Biden’s team have also acknowledged the situation changed under Trump, and forcing Iran back to the negotiating table will be difficult even though the country is eager to see crippling economic sanctions lifted.

Likewise, few Middle East experts believe Biden can undo policies on the ground in Israel and the West Bank made during Trump’s tenure that have drastically reduced the chances of a two-state solution.

Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a change that angered Palestinians but one Biden is unlikely to reverse. The Trump administration helped broker peace deals between Israel and several neighboring countries in recent months, something observers said would bring added stability to the region.

But Trump also developed a close alliance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has pursued a strategy of aggressive Israeli expansion in the West Bank. The growth of Jewish settlements cannot be easily rolled back and stands as an impediment to any peace talks under Biden, according to scholars who study the conflict.

Whether on Israel, Iran or a host of other issues, “it’s not possible to go back to the way things once were. That would require altering some of what happened the past few years,” said Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Biden’s foreign policy team is stacked with veteran policy makers like Antony Blinken, the nominee for secretary of State. But having an experienced team full of “traditional foreign policy thinkers” could lead the Biden administration to fall into familiar traps if they “apply traditional ideas to a changed world,” Hamid said.

Confronting a rising China

China’s emergence as an economic and military superpower is perhaps the single biggest change Biden will encounter on the foreign policy and national security front.

“In 2001, when the United States sent its forces into Afghanistan, its economy was 4.5 times the size of the combined economies of China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, and Central Asia,” Rubin said, citing World Bank data. “Today, it’s half their size,” he said, a change driven primarily by China’s steady if uneven economic growth in recent years.

The U.S. has long relied on its economic might to try to pressure Beijing on trade, intellectual property theft, human rights violations and other issues. But given China’s growing strength the strategy won’t work going forward, said McLaughlin, the former senior CIA official.

“The reality is that we are confronting a rising China. It doesn’t mean that China has to be our enemy. But it’s going to be a competitor and a force in the world,” McLaughlin said.

Taking on China and other threats will require a multilateral approach between the U.S. and its European allies and bipartisan consensus in Congress, foreign policy watchers said. But even there, Biden will likely run into problems getting buy-in from Republicans and European allies worried that political divisions in America will undercut Biden’s ability to present a unified U.S. front to the world.

“In the past there was at least some bipartisan consensus on major foreign policy, and a group of elder statesmen that tended to be less partisan. That is no longer the case on the Republican side,” Hamid said. The principle that “America has this moral leadership role to play in the world” is “just not where the heart of the Republican Party is.”

“The world isn’t sure what we’re going to do next,” McLaughlin said. Despite Biden’s victory and his pledge to restore American leadership abroad, “we look like a divided country. Our partners, and potential partners, have to ask themselves, just how divided are we, and how permanent is it?”"

The U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, is in decline. The second thing is that, as proven by the latest Latino Donor Collaborative U.S. Latino GDP Report, the world’s leading growth economy is right here in America. Now the question is, will Joe Biden or President Donald Trump leverage this advantage?

Even before the coronavirus struck, the economy was in trouble. Workforce growth rate has been in decline; small businesses continue to struggle, the number of people employed in manufacturing has declined; family farm bankruptcies are at an eight-year high; real wages for American workers have barely budged; and we’re even losing in the trade war as China’s trade surplus with the U.S. has grown almost 25 percent since Trump became president.

As we look ahead, we need to talk about how to catalyze our economy and return to the growth we have experienced in the past.

In contrast, some of our strongest GDP growth occurred during the Reagan years. President Ronald Reagan understood the value of encouraging investment in areas of growth and welcoming immigrants to supplement our existing workforce so we could increase goods and services production while creating more jobs. During President Bill Clinton's administration, GDP growth was even higher. Trump was not on track to match either president, even before Covid-19 hit.

So as we look ahead, we need to talk about how to catalyze our economy and return to the growth we have experienced in the past. How do we do that? By leveraging the cohort that is growing dramatically faster than all others, creating new businesses at a faster pace, employing millions of Americans, supplying the most productive labor force and leading consumption. That is the U.S. Latino cohort, which has become, right here within our own country, a world-leading economy.

The new Latino Donor Collaborative U.S. Latino GDP Report shows the U.S. Latino cohort is already equivalent to the eighth largest economy in the world. In fact, according to the report, U.S. Latino GDP is now at $2.6 trillion, an 8.7 percent growth rate from 2017 to 2018. That’s a growth rate outpacing India and China. Given its trajectory, U.S. Latino GDP is poised to surpass France, the U.K. and India — possibly within the next five years.

This unprecedented economic growth train left the station back in 2005 and has been gaining speed ever since. More and more U.S. Latinos are becoming old enough to work each year, adding to the millions already working, plus workers from previous generations are moving into higher-income roles. Meanwhile, the education rate is dramatically increasing every year, incomes are growing and driving consumption and the result is consistent GDP growth.

The good news is the economic momentum of the U.S. Latino cohort has so far been able to overcome the headwinds it has faced from anti-immigration policies and anti-Latino rhetoric. Making this growth even more remarkable is that the U.S. Latino cohort is one of the most under-capitalized cohorts in our country, and therein lies our unparalleled opportunity.

Asset management firms, CEOs, corporate boards, nonprofits, everyone responsible for managing assets for returns, investing assets for returns and allocating resources for returns should begin deploying their capital where the growth is in our economy: the U.S. Latino cohort. This is our nation’s differentiating competitive advantage versus other large, aging economies. It is illogical to not be investing in this cohort that is catalyzing growth in every part of our economy, whether they are our essential workers, entrepreneurs, business owners or professionals. They are enabling our competitiveness, providing health care, expanding our culture and improving the quality of life for all Americans in our country.

As a capitalist, it is imperative, in my opinion, that capitalism in our country move now from working for just “the few” to working for “the many.” That means making certain the U.S. Latino cohort is catalyzed even further through access and connections to capital, especially getting money into the hands of Latino-owned small businesses and entrepreneurs, as well as the hands of U.S. Latino-founded funds so they can grow and invest more knowledgeably in this cohort, while at the same time making certain that U.S. Latinos are active in the most senior positions on boards of directors and in C-suites.

While U.S. Latinos make up nearly 20 percent of our population, they make up only around 4 percent of this country’s executive ranks, and less than 3 percent of directors on Fortune 500 boards are Latino. A logical growth strategy for our country, in addition to increasing capital flow, must include increasing the number of U.S. Latinos in boardrooms and executive offices to 15 percent within the next five years.

An axiom in business is that leadership in boards must understand their customers and the markets they serve. Therefore, U.S. Latino representation on boards is key to understanding and serving this leading growth cohort. Leadership that understands its growing customer base is essential to catalyzing profitable growth, growing employee wages and increasing shareholder return.

As a capitalist, it is imperative, in my opinion, that capitalism in our country move now from working for just “the few” to working for “the many.”

The additional return on investing in this cohort should also be clear to the millions of baby boomers who are leaving the workforce yearly, and the Gen X folks following them, because it is this U.S. Latino cohort that will have the largest responsibility for paying taxes that sustain the Social Security and Medicare programs retirees are counting on.

When capital flows to where the growth is, wealth creation occurs. The more people creating wealth, the greater the growth of an economy. That’s how capitalism works in an economy, and by broadening the flow of capital to the U.S. Latino cohort and engaging U.S. Latinos at the highest levels, we as a country can catalyze the world-leading growth of this cohort even further, expanding our competitive advantage and attracting investors worldwide.

Like so many U.S. Latinos, my family roots in this country go back 500 years, well before the Mayflower landed. So this month, when I see celebrations of Hispanic Heritage Month, I personally am celebrating the United States of America, and with the latest facts and data about what the U.S. Latino cohort means for my country, this is a celebration and opportunity from which all Americans should find enjoyment and benefit."
52,Broadcasting Joe Biden's Economic Program - The New Yorker,Broadcasting Joe Biden's Economic Program  The New Yorker,"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbmV3cy9vdXItY29sdW1uaXN0cy9icm9hZGNhc3Rpbmctam9lLWJpZGVucy1lY29ub21pYy1wcm9ncmFt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The New Yorker,"A few days ago, Bernie Sanders warned Joe Biden’s campaign that it needed to broaden its focus from attacking Donald Trump. “You got to give people an alternative or reason to vote for you other than saying, ‘I’m not Donald Trump,’ ” Sanders, who is supporting Biden, told PBS. “And that means talking about an economics program, which Biden has. It’s not as strong as I would like it—it’s not the Bernie Sanders program, despite what Trump will tell you. But it is a strong program that will improve the lives of many millions of people.”

Given the lead that Biden holds in the opinion polls, it can be argued that he must be doing something right. Still, Sanders’s point is a legitimate one. Even if focussing on the incumbent—a strategy that was on full display at the Democratic National Convention—is the best way to challenge a rogue President like Trump, it shouldn’t preclude Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, from emphasizing how their Administration would make things better for ordinary Americans that are struggling to get by. As the Democratic Party increasingly becomes the party of highly educated voters who are horrified by Trump’s daily outrages, it also needs to attract working-class voters who perhaps don’t follow politics as closely. I’m talking about working-class Black voters in places like Philadelphia and Milwaukee, working-class Hispanic voters in places like Florida and Nevada, and working-class white voters in places like western Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

Members of the working class have borne the brunt of wage stagnation, globalization, technological change, the private health-care system, and, most recently, the coronavirus pandemic. “They are looking for a leader who will make big changes in health care, fight for working people over big business, and unite the country to defeat the current economic and public-health crisis,” Stan Greenberg, the veteran Democratic pollster, wrote in an article for The American Prospect, last week. In this passage, Greenberg was referring specifically to white working-class voters, whom he has been studying in focus groups and through surveys. But he pointed out that economic concerns and anger at the political establishment also runs “deep into the Democratic base of Blacks, Hispanics, unmarried women, and millennials, too.”

As Sanders noted, the good news for Biden is that his policy plans do, in fact, have a good deal to offer working people of all races—especially compared to Trump’s platform, which is essentially bare in this area. The former Vice-President would raise taxes on the rich to finance programs targeted at those with low and moderate incomes in a number of different areas, including education, health care, housing, and Social Security. Taken individually, none of Biden’s proposals has the transformative appeal of Sanders’s Medicare for All plan, Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax, or Andrew Yang’s universal basic income. But if Congress passed Biden’s economic policy agenda, and it worked as designed, it would make life easier for countless working Americans who need a helping hand.

Here are some specifics. Targeting working parents who have kids under school age and are struggling to afford day care, Biden has proposed a national pre-K program for all children ages three and four. (Other rich countries, such as France and Germany, already have such a program.) For people nearing retirement age who can’t find an affordable health-care plan, Biden has pledged to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from sixty-five to sixty. For low-income families struggling to find an affordable place to live, he has promised to make rent subsidies more widely available by expanding the Section 8 federal-housing-voucher program. For young people who want to go to college but are worried about racking up student debt, he has pledged to eliminate tuition payments entirely at two-year community colleges and to eliminate tuition payments at four-year public colleges and universities for students from families that earn less than a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars a year.

In budgetary terms, the sums involved in rolling out these and other Biden programs would be considerable. According to a new study by economists at the Wharton School, the Democrat’s education proposals alone would cost $1.9 trillion over ten years. All told, his economic plans would “raise $3.375 trillion in new tax revenue” between 2021 and 2030, “while increasing spending by $5.37 trillion,” the study says. On an annual basis, the proposed spending increase is equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of current G.D.P., or roughly twelve per cent of total federal spending.

You might ask where all this money would come from. A Biden Administration would raise most of it by reversing the tax cuts for corporations and high-income households that were enacted in the feed-the-rich tax bill that Trump and the Republicans pushed through in 2017, and also by raising some other taxes targeted at the wealthy. Under Biden’s plan, according to the Wharton study, households in the top one per cent of the income distribution would see their effective federal tax rate rise from 30.7 per cent to 37.4 per cent. Super-rich households—those in the top 0.1 per cent—would see their effective tax rates go from 30.6 per cent to forty-three per cent. For people in the bottom ninety-five per cent (those who make up to $282,663 a year), there wouldn’t be much of a change at all.

Biden gave a series of speeches back in July in which he laid out his economic agenda. And last week, in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, he unveiled a series of proposals to boost American manufacturing. But in this addled news climate, policy proposals rarely get the coverage they deserve in the venues that most voters rely on—television and online-news feeds. To break through the cacophony of Trump noise, Biden, Harris, and other Democrats need to be out there every day ballyhooing their spending plans, as well as other proposals that wouldn’t affect the federal budget but that would boost the budgets of working families.

The Biden-Harris ticket wants to guarantee all Americans twelve weeks of paid medical and family leave. It would increase the national minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour, which would have a big impact on low-paid workers in places like Pennsylvania and Texas, where the hourly minimum is currently just $7.25; in Florida, where its $8.56; and in Ohio, where its $8.70. Biden’s agenda includes an expansion of home and community-based care for the elderly, and provisions to insure that, as the number of caregivers increases, they are well-paid and have the right to join a labor union. He has also vowed to strengthen labor laws and unions more broadly. Among other things, he supports the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed in 2019. Legislative changes of this type would take a while to have a macroeconomic impact. Over time, though, restoring some of the bargaining power that workers have lost in recent decades could help raise wages and reduce inequality.

Of course, Biden’s policy platform could be better. A couple of personal quibbles: it doesn’t address the self-dealing and greed of top corporate executives, which has been evident again during the pandemic; and it doesn’t adequately confront rising monopoly power, especially in the tech sector. But it contains a lot of other progressive proposals, and compared to the alternative—four more years of plutocracy thinly disguised as populism—it’s infinitely preferable. Between now and November 3rd, everyone associated with the Biden campaign, and, indeed, everyone who wants to see the back of Trump, should seize every opportunity to make this clear.

53,Can Joe Biden Unrig the Economy? - The Nation,Can Joe Biden Unrig the Economy?  The Nation,"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lY29ub215L2JpZGVuLXRheC1wbGFuL9IBP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lY29ub215L2JpZGVuLXRheC1wbGFuL3RuYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Nation,"This article appears in the September 7/14, 2020 issue.

The Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary race was obsessed with taxes. There was the public debate over how to pay for Medicare for All. There was also the insider dispute among experts, no less contentious, over the feasibility and desirability of a wealth tax. Yet, as was often the case during the primaries, these discussions rarely included the person who was leading in the polls for almost the entire race: Joe Biden, whose tax plan is a serious proposal to reduce the power and income of the 1 percent. The former vice president’s bold scheme provides a useful reference for where the tax discourse among progressives should go next.

According to the Tax Policy Center, Biden’s plan would raise upwards of $4 trillion over 10 years, similar to the amounts that would be raised by a wealth tax. And like the wealth tax supported by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the money would come entirely from those at the very top of the income distribution. The plan would do this by increasing the corporate income tax from 21 to 28 percent and the top marginal rate for those making over $400,000 a year from 37 to 39.6 percent, reversing most of Donald Trump’s tax cuts. It would also remove the cap on Social Security payroll taxes for those making above $400,000, generating revenue for this vital program for low-income retirees.

But the biggest difference from the status quo is that the plan would increase taxes on capital income. Instead of giving a preferential lower rate to those who make their income from owning wealth rather than working, Biden’s plan would tax the capital gains and dividend income of those earning more than $1 million as regular income at the increased 39.6 percent rate. It would also close inheritance loopholes, including one known as step-up in basis, which allows elites to shelter increases in wealth from taxation at death. Such tax rules drive the intergenerational transfer of wealth among the ultrarich. All told, Biden’s tax plan would reduce the after-tax income of the top 1 percent by around 17 percent. The results would be concentrated among the top 0.1 percent, whose after-tax income would fall an estimated 23.4 percent.

For the left, there are three important questions that follow if this becomes the new baseline of the Democratic Party’s tax agenda. The first is whether it is necessary to tax wealth directly rather than tax income from wealth. One advantage of Biden’s proposal is that it would be easier to execute and would more easily survive a challenge in courts stacked with Trump-appointed judges. Another is that as income taxes become more aggressive, they start to do the work of a wealth tax. As Greg Leiserson of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth explained to me, the line between wealth and income from wealth blurs if that income is vigorously taxed. If Biden’s plan is fully implemented, it could significantly reduce wealth inequality. On the other hand, if executed poorly or with weak enforcement, it would make the case for a wealth tax better than any proponent could.

There is also the question of whether we should be focused on taxing people broadly or concentrating taxation on those at the very top. Biden’s plan forgoes the first option and aims its taxes at the very rich. For the time being, there is significant revenue to be raised with this approach, which would deliver more than enough to pay for free public college, universal day care, and a child allowance and to liberate many other aspects of our lives from the market.

Given low interest rates and a severe recession, there’s no pressure on the left to make the case for broad-based taxation. To the extent that taxing the rich comes up in the context of austerity or a bipartisan bargain to balance the budget, it should be rejected. Interest rates have been low for decades, and with pressing political issues to address, the main focus should be on how to spend. The prospect of raising taxes on the rich, however, should remain. Taxes don’t just raise revenues; they also structure the income distribution. And raising taxes on the rich would help stop the economy from simply channeling income to executives and owners. Taxes are about determining who benefits from the economy, and for too long, that has been only the rich. A sharp increase in taxes, as the Biden campaign has proposed, would push back significantly against that."

Biden won Pennsylvania, pushing him past the 270 electoral votes he needed and prompting the Associated Press to declare him the winner.

The president-elect will inherit an economy ravaged by the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to more than 235,000 deaths, 22 million jobs lost (half of which it’s barely recovered) and an unemployment rate that reached almost 15% in April.

Some of Biden’s key plans include providing paid leave for sick workers, investing $700 billion in a “Made in All of America” campaign, moving toward cleaner energy, and protecting the Affordable Care Act. But they will likely face obstacles with a divided government.

The Senate race is still unclear, with the Republican party in control of 48 seats and the Democratic party with 46 (plus two Independents, who caucus with them). Two races in Georgia have yet to be decided, and could head to runoff elections that won’t be decided until January. If the Democrats gain those seats, they’ll have a 50-50 deadlock and a vice president who gets to break any ties.

Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, told Marketplace that he expects the economy to get to full employment about three years from now under a Biden presidency and a split Congress. (A second-term Trump presidency with a split Congress would have an even longer delay because of Trump’s trade and immigration policies, according to Zandi.)

Keith Wade — the chief economist at Schroders, an international asset manager — also noted that a split Congress under Biden will likely pass more stimulus, which would add two- to three-tenths of a percentage more in terms of GDP growth.

Here’s a closer look at some of the plans and policies that Biden is advocating for:

The COVID-19 crisis

COVID-19 continues to spread across the country, with the U.S. reporting a record 120,000 cases in a single day on Thursday. To address the pandemic, Biden has proposed “eliminating cost barriers” when it comes to preventing the disease and caring for those affected by it. Some of his plans include:

An emergency paid leave plan for individuals like sick workers and gig economy workers that will cover 100% of weekly salaries or average weekly earnings capped at $1,400 a week.

Free testing for everyone who needs it.

Providing relief or forbearance of federal student loans and federally backed mortgages.

Granting interest-free loans to small businesses who are facing issues related to COVID-19.

Fully staffing all federal agencies, task forces and scientific and economic advisory groups focused on health security to prevent the threat of future infectious diseases.

Jobs and wages

Biden has branded his vision for the future of U.S. jobs as “Made in All of America.” He wants to strengthen domestic manufacturing, as well as public and private sector unions. Here are some of the priorities he’s outlined:

Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Creating at least 5 million new jobs in manufacturing and innovation.

Investing $700 billion in manufacturing and technology, with $400 billion going toward purchasing U.S.-based goods and services, and $300 billion going toward Research & Development.

Eliminating non-compete clauses and no-poaching agreements, except in certain circumstances.

Expanding overtime pay for workers. The Obama-Biden administration had pushed to extend pay for over 4 million workers, but a Trump-era rule had only extended it to 1.3 million people.

Halting the flow of federal dollars to employers who engage in union-busting activities, and stopping employers from stalling negotiations with newly formed unions.

Taxes

Biden’s tax plan aims to increase taxes on high earners and reinstate policies that had been in place prior to the Trump administration. It includes:

Raising taxes on Americans making more than $400,000, while keeping tax rates at current levels for anybody making under that amount.

Restoring the top tax rate for individuals from 37% to 39.6%. The top tax bracket applies to individuals making more than about $518,400 and joint married couples making more than about $622,000.

Capping the tax benefits of itemized deductions to 28% of value. So for those with tax rates higher than 28%, they would see a 28-cent tax reduction for every dollar spent on charitable giving, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Increase the long-term capital gains tax rate (which is placed on profits from asset sales) from 23.8% to 39.6% for people with incomes over $1 million.

Raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

Imposing sanctions on tax havens.

Raising tax rates on foreign profits.

An analysis of Biden’s policies from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model found that between 2021–2030, Biden’s platform would raise $3.375 trillion in additional tax revenue, increase government spending by $5.37 trillion in areas like education and Social Security, and decrease the federal debt by 6.1%.

Climate change

Over the summer, Biden announced a $2 trillion plan to combat climate change and invest in clean energy, with the long-term goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. His goals include:

Providing American cities with 100,000 or more residents with zero-emissions public transportation options like light rail networks and infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes to increase energy efficiency.

Creating 1.5 million sustainable homes and housing units.

Creating jobs in “climate-smart agriculture, resilience and conservation,” which would entail reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock and uranium mines.

Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, which the U.S. formally withdrew from this week. Under the agreement, about 200 countries have pledged to reduce carbon emissions.

The effects of climate change have especially been in the national spotlight recently as wildfires have spread across the West Coast, which experts attribute in part to climate change. While Trump blamed the wildfires on forest management, Biden has acknowledged the role of global warming in these disasters and called Trump a “climate arsonist.”

Within the Democratic party, House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey have proposed a Green New Deal, a broad vision that calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adding millions of new jobs and providing universal health care. While Republicans have claimed that Biden is pushing for the GND, his plans are far less sweeping and wouldn’t include universal health care.

“The Green New Deal that the president keeps trying to talk about — it’s not a bad deal. But it’s not the plan I have. That’s the Biden Green Deal,” Biden said during an interview with CNN.

Biden’s position on fracking, which has been muddled, also diverges from the climate proposals to those left of him.

While Trump and other Republicans say that he wants to end the practice, Biden has recently been adamant that he doesn’t. “I’m not banning fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. I’m going to protect Pennsylvanian jobs, period,” Biden told supporters in the state this October.

However, when asked back in 2019 whether there would be “any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration,” he said “we would make sure it’s eliminated.”

He also mentioned he was against “new fracking” in a primary debate earlier this year.

Racial inequality

Biden has released plans aimed at investing in the “economic mobility” of communities of color, which would entail:

Devoting $100 billion in low-interest loans to funding state, local, tribal and non-profit lending programs in communities of color.

Spending more than $50 billion in startup capital to help entrepreneurs of color in economically disadvantaged areas.

Investing over $70 billion in historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions.

The House of Representatives also wants to establish a federal commission for reparations that would create a proposal and remedy plan, which Biden has endorsed.

“Relative to his predecessors, that’s pretty dramatic,” said Vincent Hutchings, a professor of political science and Afroamerican and African studies at the University of Michigan.

Calls for economic reparations for the African descendants of slavery have intensified in recent years, with Democratic candidates voicing their support on the issue in some form or another.

However, Hutchings pointed out that Biden has not outright said he’s in favor of reparations. Given the amount of racial inequities in the U.S., Hutching said he thinks anything short of reparations is unlikely to be effective.

In 2016, white families had a median wealth of $171,000 compared to the median wealth of $17,600 for black families, according to the Federal Reserve Board. And there is a 30-percentage-point gap between Black and white homeownership, according to the Urban Institute.

These figures are reflective of how most of the wealth in the country is skewed toward a relatively small number of wealthy, mostly white, people.

Many activists have also called for defunding the police, a proposal that became the topic of national conversation after George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis.

A Washington Post analysis found that Black and Hispanic Americans are killed by the police at a disproportionate rate. While Black Americans account for less than 13% of the U.S. population, they are killed at more than twice the rate of white Americans.

Biden has written that he does not support defunding, and has instead proposed investing $300 million in policing that would involve changes like more diverse police officers and more body cameras.

Health care

Protecting the Affordable Care Act is one of Biden’s main priorities when it comes to health care. His plans for health insurance include:

Giving Americans a public, government-run health insurance option like Medicare. Right now, federal programs like Medicare are only available to certain groups, like those over 65.

Lowering the limit on the cost of health care coverage from 9.86% of someone’s income to 8.5%.

Repealing the law that prevents Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug corporations.

Ending surprise billing, which happens when patients are unaware they are receiving care from an out-of-network provider. Health care providers would not be able to charge out-of-network rates when the patient doesn’t have control over which provider he or she is seeing.

Unlike other Democratic leaders, such as Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Biden has backed away from Medicare for all and has said he would veto it due to the costs. That position has created a divide between the party’s center and those on the left.

“But he is pushing for a public option to the Affordable Care Act, which is further than Obama pushed it,” Hutchings said. “[Obama] did campaign on the notion of a public option, but then he backed away from it.”

Student loans

One of the primary aims of Biden’s higher education plan is to help Americans “join or maintain their place in the middle class.” Some of his key plans are:

Making four-year public colleges and universities tuition-free for all students whose families make less than $125,000.

Doubling the maximum value of Pell grants, which currently stands at $6,345 for the 2020-21 award year.

Halving payments on undergraduate federal student loans so that individuals will pay 5% of their discretionary income (income minus taxes and essential spending like housing) over $25,000 towards their loans. Right now, people generally pay 10% of their income.)

Providing 100% loan forgiveness for students who have made payments through the program “responsibly” after 20 years.

Housing

Biden has proposed investing $640 billion over the next decade for housing that’s affordable and also accessible to those with disabilities, which would include:

Plans to end redlining and discriminatory practices in the housing market. States receiving federal dollars through certain grants will have to develop a strategy for inclusionary zoning.

Creating a refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 when Americans purchase a home for the first time.

Establishing a $100 billion fund to construct affordable housing.

Protecting tenants by enacting the Legal Assistance to Prevent Evictions Act of 2020, which would help them access legal assistance.

55,Why the economy would be stronger under Biden than Trump - CNN,Why the economy would be stronger under Biden than Trump  CNN,"Thu, 01 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMC8xMC8wMS9wZXJzcGVjdGl2ZXMvZWNvbm9teS1iaWRlbi10cnVtcC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMC8xMC8wMS9wZXJzcGVjdGl2ZXMvZWNvbm9teS1iaWRlbi10cnVtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"Editor’s Note: Mark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

More than six months since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the US economy remains in a bad place. One-fifth of American workers are either unemployed, too discouraged to look for work and thus are not counted as unemployed, have lost work hours or have suffered a pay cut because of the pandemic. Hope that the economy would come roaring back is fading.

Voters are wondering whether President Donald Trump or Vice President Joe Biden has the better plan to get the economy past the pandemic and back to full strength. Their plans couldn’t be more different. Based on our analysis, Biden has it right, and Trump has it wrong.

Trump’s plan is simple — double down on the policies he pursued in his first term. Because he thinks he fixed the economy prior to the pandemic, he thinks he can fix it again. The problem with this logic is that the economy was doing just fine when he took office. In the last three years of Obama’s presidency, the economy created more jobs and unemployment fell more than in Trump’s first three years.

The President likes to point to the stock market as evidence that his economic policies are working. But credit for a rising market should go to the Federal Reserve, which slashed interest rates nearly to zero, and which has indicated that rates won’t budge until the economy has fully recovered.

The President nonetheless believes his economic policies were a success and we should expect more of the same in his second term. This means more tax cuts. Corporations and the well-to-do benefited most from the massive tax cuts Trump signed into law at the end of 2017, but some of those cuts expire soon, and he wants to make them permanent.

Trump will also likely resume his damaging tariff war with China, which he put on hold late last year with the so-called Phase One trade deal. Once the dust settles after the pandemic and it becomes obvious that the deal had little impact on Chinese behavior, the tariff wars will undoubtedly heat up again. Tensions with other trading partners will also remain high. Any improvement in the trade deficit between the United States and China since the trade war began has been offset by widening deficits between the United States and other nations. Global manufacturers have not meaningfully shifted their production back to the United States. Instead, they’ve moved to other countries, like Vietnam, with low production costs. Trump has focused his ire on nations with which the United States runs trade deficits, and that ire will continue in his next four years.

President Trump will also inevitably clamp down further on foreign immigration, which will weaken longer-term economic growth. Immigration restrictions slow growth in both the labor force, which is problematic due to a potential decline in our working-age population, and labor productivity, since immigrants tend to be risk-takers who start new companies and fuel innovation.

Biden promises to implement the opposite of many of Trump’s policies. He has pledged that he will continue to push the Chinese to abide by international trade laws, but he would do so by re-engaging with the World Trade Organization and implementing other multilateral strategies. Biden has talked about the possibility of recommitting to a modified Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement, with tougher labor and environmental provisions.

The TPP was the deal between the United States and other Pacific Rim nations that excluded China, because that country didn’t play fair. The Obama administration had agreed to the TTP, but Trump withdrew from it with one of his first executive orders.

Biden would also normalize foreign immigration, by granting Dreamers — undocumented residents brought here as children — citizenship, allowing refugees and asylum seekers to come to America and supporting the sweeping immigration reform legislation that nearly became law in Obama’s second term.

To realize his plans, Biden will aggressively ramp up government spending. He proposes big investments in infrastructure, including the usual emphasis on roads and bridges, but also clean energy and research and development, such as 5G, battery technology and artificial intelligence. Investments in education would also get a big boost, including early childhood education, free public college tuition for lower- and middle-income students and student loan debt relief. The social safety net would also get stronger, with more funds for health care, child and elder care, housing and Social Security.

To help pay for this, Biden says he will increase taxes on corporations and the well-to-do, unwinding many of Trump’s tax cuts. The Trump tax cuts haven’t lifted business investment and economic growth much, certainly not to the extent he advertises, and thus any fallout from the higher taxes would be modest. Nor would there be much impact on the spending of wealthier households given their considerable savings.

Biden’s government spending plan will result in bigger budget deficits. This would be a problem in most times, as it would result in higher interest rates that would undermine the benefits of the increased spending. But not now. Because if Biden wins the election, he will inherit an economy with extraordinarily high unemployment, ensuring that through much of his term the Fed will hold to near-zero interest rates. This is the time to run larger deficits to get the economy back to full employment as quickly as possible.

Trump and Biden could hardly be more different. This is especially clear when it comes to economic policy. Voters couldn’t have a clearer choice."

So while most fans have been obsessing over this season's drama with Princess Diana, I'm still in the mid-1960s, when the tragedy was Britain's decline to mediocrity from the heights of empire.

There are things Americans can do to stay in China's league, starting with accepting their fate and using their friends to greater advantage.

The U.K.'s begging the United States for a bailout to avoid default in 1965 was a sad denouement to the story of the country that colonized most of North America, the Caribbean and South Asia. And it's hard to do what I do for a living without wondering whether a story of global supremacy is once again coming to a sorry conclusion. After President-elect Joe Biden gets Covid-19 under control and reignites the economy, he should focus on stopping the decline of the American Empire — lest the world's most important democracy end up a shadow of itself, as Britain did two decades after the Second World War.

The world looks at a country differently when it no longer is supreme, and the sun is about to set on the United States' eight-decade run as the world's dominant economy. By some measures that adjust for the value of currencies, China's economy eclipsed the U.S.'s in 2016. And it's close to universally accepted that China's will be the biggest by any measure within a decade.

After President Xi Jinping led the world economy out of the Great Recession a decade ago by ordering a massive stimulus program, his country is set to lead the world again, as China's will probably be the only major economy that grows this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.

While there's dispute about when China will reach the largest economy milestone — a research group backed by the Chinese government predicted recently that the flip will occur only in 2032 — the exact date doesn't really matter. The point is that the U.S. is on the verge of surrendering its most important advantage over the rest of the world. There's not much the U.S. can do about that, given that China's 1.4 billion people are getting richer while America's economic growth has naturally slowed at a high level. But there are things Americans can do to stay in China's league, starting with accepting their fate and using their friends to greater advantage.

America's military is often seen as what sets it apart, and while there's no rival for its armed forces, several countries are capable of inflicting nuclear destruction. Only the U.S., however, has had the financial clout to muscle into any situation it wants to. China will soon be its match on that front, along with being one of the global heavies with an arsenal of nukes. So they are on trajectories that will make them at least equals. The risk is that they won't stay that way, as history is replete with examples of bad things happening when existing powers refuse to make room for rising ones.

""A thing that will feel pretty strange is that the Chinese economy is probably going to be at least twice as big as the United States' economy, maybe three times,"" Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Tesla, said this year. ""The foundation of war is economics,"" Musk added. ""If you have half the resources of the counterparty, then you better be real innovative. If you're not innovative, you're going to lose.""

If you question Musk's credentials to herald an epic showdown, how about Harvard University? The Kennedy School of Government has devoted special attention to the question of whether the U.S. and China can avoid ""Thucydides' Trap,"" named after the celebrated author of History of the Peloponnesian War, who observed, ""It was the rise of Athens, and the fear that this instilled in Sparta, that made war inevitable.""

Biden's goal should be coexistence, and the U.S.'s best chance is to beat its Asian rival at its own game.

China has been extending its reach through economic diplomacy of both the friendly and the unfriendly sort. The country created an international lending institution in 2016 as a rival to the World Bank; it already has more than 100 members, and it has been spending the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars throughout Asia and Europe to create a trade corridor that would extend to Europe from East Asia.

Last month, it facilitated the creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, a 15-country trade agreement, including Japan, Australia and South Korea, that will cover 2.3 billion people and about 30 percent of the world's gross domestic product. In comparison, the U.S. trade agreement with Canada and Mexico covers 28 percent. The RCEP was seen as a publicity win for China, as President Donald Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that would have tied the U.S. to many of the same countries with which China will partner under the RCEP.

At the same time, China has developed a Trumpian knack for bullying trade partners with arbitrary duties, including the imposing of tariffs on imports from Australia and the blacklisting of canola from Canada, after both countries offended Beijing. The upshot is that China is now viewed as a menace in such countries, when not so long ago it was seen as a potential counterbalance to America's dominance.

For instance, Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had wanted to negotiate a free trade agreement with China when he was first elected in 2015, but that's no longer on the table. Xi's government arbitrarily jailed two Canadian citizens two years ago in apparent retaliation for Canada's detention of a Chinese executive sought by U.S. authorities. China was in a position to make friends, and it has ended up making enemies.

China's poor treatment of smaller countries is Biden's opening. The president-elect's idea to assemble the world's leading democracies for a summit that would get them all on the same page is a good one. ""China can't afford to ignore half the global economy,"" Biden wrote this year in Foreign Affairs.

He's right. Trump's mistake was assuming he could use the weight of the U.S. economy to bring China to heel. But China is too big for that now. America needs help. It's not something for which Americans are used to asking, but it could be the price of maintaining their influence."

While the economic recovery tops Biden’s agenda, the torrid job gains of the past few months will inevitably slow, as they already have. There’s little chance that the loss in momentum will be the fault of the new president. Deeper economic trends are afoot.

Job growth has decelerated every month since June, and there are signs from the hard-hit travel and restaurant industries that the fast-spreading novel coronavirus could put economic growth into reverse.

President Trump’s single term in office is poised to end with apocalyptic job losses followed by a string of impressive monthly job gains. That has less to do with policy and more to do with how the coronavirus crisis hit swifter and deeper than anything before it, giving plenty of room for a rapid early recovery, as businesses reopened and $4 trillion in federal aid washed through the economy.

In April, as the U.S. shutdown deepened, 18.1 million laid-off workers said they expected to be called back to their employers, Labor Department data shows. As of October, there were only about 3.2 million of them left — the rest were either rehired or, in some cases, laid off permanently. That flood of workers returning from temporary layoffs translated into rapid employment gains. Over the same period that temporary layoffs ended for 14.9 million workers, the economy gained 16.4 million jobs.

The vast majority of workers leaving temporary layoffs appear to be returning to their previous jobs, according to Eliza Forsythe, a labor economist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a recession specialist who has dug into federal data on the temporarily unemployed in recent work.

Not all of those who left the ranks of the temporarily unemployed got their jobs back, of course. Some of them were laid off for good, as were some of their unemployed peers. Even as the number of temporarily laid-off workers plunged, the number of those permanently laid off doubled. By October, most layoffs were permanent. If unemployed workers were going to get their jobs back, they probably already had.

The ranks of those permanently laid off are likely to grow. Well over a million workers are still being laid off or fired each month. And to be counted in the above chart, which includes only the unemployed, people need to have actively sought work in the past month. That means the chart excludes about 3.7 million workers who have quit working or looking for work entirely since February — and many of those workers will be added to the total number of unemployed once they’re looking for work again.

“Once the pandemic is over, once schools are opened, once it’s safe to go back to work, they’re likely to go back to the labor force,” Forysthe said.

But signs are growing that the labor market could get worse before it gets better. Job losses continue to spread to high-skill sectors once considered safe from the pandemic’s fallout.

In late October, the announcements came strong and fast, and not just from oil companies like ExxonMobil and entertainment companies like Disney, but across the board. For example, Austin tech company National Instruments announced at the end of October that it would lay off about 650 of its workers worldwide, the Austin American-Statesman reported. And according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, schools in Pennsylvania’s state university system moved to lay off more than 100 full-time faculty, 80 of whom either hold tenure or are on the tenure track.

Economists say such job losses may take longer to recover from, as it can be difficult for specialized workers to find positions that match their skills and expectations.

Workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher initially avoided the worst of the crisis; many of them could work from home. By August, they had recovered their job losses entirely. But as layoffs spread from service jobs to the white-collar and back-office jobs they support, college-educated workers are losing ground. In September and October, America’s extensive college-educated workforce shrank.

About 1 in 4 of their less-educated counterparts lost their jobs earlier in this recession. But those groups recovered rapidly and have shown healthy job gains in recent months — they’re more than two-thirds of the way back from the depths of the recession.

In another sign that the downturn has spread to skilled jobs not directly affected by the initial coronavirus shutdowns, we saw continued losses in education and other jobs that rely heavily on public-sector funds.

“The recession has led to a dramatic fall in tax revenue for state and local governments, which temporarily upends their budgets,” Forsythe said. “Once the economy recovers, they’ll be back on track, but without federal support they have to make cuts.”

Lack of adequate federal support forced state and local governments to slash payrolls during the Great Recession, Forsythe said. It’s one of the reasons the economy took so long to dig out of the Great Recession, and current weakness in the public sector is a warning sign it may be happening all over again. A potential public-sector bailout has long been a sticking point in negotiations over a second round of stimulus aid.

In almost every direction, Biden will face stronger head winds than his predecessor. The clearest potential job gains have already been realized, the coronavirus is spreading through the U.S. population seemingly unchecked, and prospects for broad government stimulus are uncertain.

The country is now seeing more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases a day. That’s double the numbers seen a month ago. It’s triple the rate in September. And, as economists have long maintained, the economy cannot be rebuilt without first containing the virus.

We won’t have comprehensive data on fourth-quarter economic output until next year, but early signs of trouble have already appeared in real-time measures of activity for the hard-hit travel and restaurant industries.

Data from the Transportation Security Administration shows that the number of passengers lining up at TSA checkpoints has fallen in recent days. After a promising start to the much-reduced fall travel season, air travel is back to a third of what it was at the same time last year.

The reservation app OpenTable shows a similar pattern. Restaurant activity had been picking back up but slipped in October as the pandemic surged and diners stayed home. Now it stands at about half its usual level.

One way to think about pandemic-era unemployment benefits is that the government is paying workers to stay home to limit the spread of infection. If pandemic-related benefit expansions aren’t renewed before they start to expire in December, Americans could be forced to return to workplaces before it’s safe to do so. That could create a vicious cycle of infection, Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao said.

Workers who lose their benefits may be pushed to return to the workforce just as the pandemic goes into overdrive. That could accelerate both the spread of the virus and the plunge in economic activity.

“It’s certainly possible that we could see job losses in the November report or even in one of the other winter reports, depending on how the pandemic evolves,” Zhao said.

To be sure, despite the likely short-term slowdown, Biden could post one of the best longer-term job-creation records of any president in recent memory. His secret weapon isn’t a particular skill or policy, it’s just that the economy is operating well below its capacity. Unlike President Barack Obama, who took office while the economy was still losing jobs, Biden will take office when the economy seems to be stumbling toward recovery but remains about 10 million jobs in the hole.

If Biden did nothing more than recover the remaining ground lost, he would do far better than Trump during his term, when the economy gained about 6.8 million jobs before plunging deep into negative territory amid a bungled response to a completely unforeseen global pandemic.

It won’t happen at anything like the average pace of a million-plus jobs a month we’ve seen during the early months of the recovery, but if all that slack in the economy permits faster-than-usual job growth, it’s likely that Biden will top both President Bill Clinton’s terms (11.6 million and 11.3 million) and Obama’s second term (10.4 million), which have set the gold standard for recent decades."

One of the top priorities for either President Donald Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden will be to rebuild America’s battered workforce and kick-start business growth. The labor market still faces a deficit of more than 10 million jobs, with more disappearing permanently. The most recent monthly employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that permanent job losses grew by 345,000 in September to 3.8 million, while the number of temporary layoffs has plunged.

“Until the election’s over, I think we and our customers are hesitant to add to head count. I think everybody is kind of holding their breath for the next few weeks to see which way things are going to turn,” said William Burgess, owner of Power Technology Inc., an Arkansas-based manufacturer of laser devices used in military and medical equipment. “We do feel that there’s some pent-up demand due to Covid-19 and the election,” he said. “I think the business community will at least have a little bit of clarity and I think things will start to shake loose with that.”

There are several key topics experts and business owners say could make or break America’s economic trajectory in the final weeks of the year and through 2021.

“The combination of being more serious about the virus and more serious about relief and stimulus will be the biggest drivers in the short run,” said Harry Holzer, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a public policy professor at Georgetown University. “Then you get into job creation proposals not tied to the pandemic like infrastructure and climate-related employment.”

Covid-19 containment

The pandemic remains the biggest unknown, and poses the biggest potential risk: Containing the spread and mitigating the public health and economic effects of Covid-19 needs to come first.

“Repeated waves lead to the risk of repeated shutdowns, but also a lot of consumer uncertainty,” said Till von Wachter, professor of economics and director of the California Policy Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles. “A national protocol of how to suppress the pandemic would certainly help give people the confidence to return” to their daily lives, including resuming activities like eating out, going to movies and taking vacations.

“The first thing they have to do is get the virus under control. That remains the biggest threat, and it doesn't look like Trump is going to be willing to do anything,” Holzer said. “Biden has shown a lot more interest in … a federal strategy on testing and tracing. I think that’s a very big difference.”

The silver lining to what would be a huge, expensive undertaking is that this imperative also presents an opportunity for job creation. “We really need WPA-program-type stimulus,” said Jeff Strohl, director of research at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. “We clearly have a need for health care technology infrastructure development,” he said. A program modeled after the National Guard to develop and train a national corps of hospital and health care workers, he suggested, could kill two birds with one stone.

Burgess said businesses like his would benefit from more readily available testing. “I would like to see free and open testing, and I think that’s one place where hourly employees have struggled in the past [because] it’s a financial hurdle for them to get tested,” he said. “Now the full cost is coming to bear on those who can least afford it, so I would be supportive of a widely available free testing option that anybody could take advantage of.” A lack of free, accessible testing means that workers run the risk of coming to work infected and unaware of their contagion, a circumstance that could trigger a superspreading event.

Fiscal stimulus

A growing number of both Beltway and Wall Street observers are operating under the assumption that if Biden wins the presidency and the Democrats retain control of the House and retake control of the Senate, a much larger stimulus package will be rolled out early in the new year.

Without this, the economic outlook is bad. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is said to be a top contender for secretary of the Treasury should Biden, have both spoken with increasing urgency in recent weeks about the need for more fiscal stimulus. “Further targeted fiscal support will be needed alongside accommodative monetary policy to turn this K-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery,” Brainard told the Society of Professional Economists last month, calling for income support in industries where workers have been hardest-hit.

Help for households is critical, Holzer said. Without income support, particularly in the form of a reinstatement of expanded unemployment insurance benefits, economic momentum will stall, he predicted. “If you don't replace the $600 bump with anything, you’ll also have a big drag because people’s consumption gets cut way back,” Holzer said.

Infrastructure

One area of spending that usually garners bipartisan support is infrastructure investment, and both Trump and Biden have referred to the topic in the past in the context of job growth. Infrastructure by itself is no silver bullet, though. “We could have shovel-ready jobs to some degree, but the money won’t hit the ground in the first 100 days,” Strohl said. “The depth of this crisis is going to demand multi-faceted entry points.”

A new model for job creation could include positions in health care and technology, along with construction and building trades.

Even a comprehensive program improving roads, bridges, railways and utilities would leave out millions of the workers hardest-hit by the pandemic: women and minorities without college degrees working in service sector jobs like food service and retail. “The people who have been hit hardest have been women and minorities,” Holzer said. “Are they the people we’re going to train for these heavy construction jobs? I think that’s somewhat unlikely.”

“Infrastructure needs to move past our old version of shovel-ready, which is really a male-oriented approach to infrastructure, and this recession has hit more women than men. Hopefully we’ll find a balance,” Strohl said, suggesting that a new model could include jobs in health care and technology along with construction and building trades.

According to data from Glassdoor.com, the three of the five fastest-growing job sectors over the past month are related to technology. “Jobs within these industries are good to keep an eye on in a post-Covid-19 economy,” said spokesman Tyler Murphy.

Training and education

Strohl said getting Americans back to work will depend on what they did beforehand, and for how long they have been sidelined. “There are those workers who could be immediately re-employed if their company opened up again, there are people who could get back into the workforce with short-term training and there are some who are permanently dislocated,” he said. “We need to think about the 10 million unemployed and see who can immediately be re-employed and under what conditions.”

Reorienting the skill sets of potentially thousands of workers will be a tremendous undertaking. The Biden campaign has proposed providing two years of community college or equivalent training to all Americans, along with a $50 billion investment in workforce training through community college partnerships and free four-year tuition for students with family incomes below $125,000.

“We’re in the high-tech field, so I do like the idea of affordable education,” Burgess said, although he added that he didn’t support free tuition across the board for college because he was worried about the expense to taxpayers. “Typically on the production floor, we’re looking for two years of college or work experience in a technical field,” he said. Burgess said his employees have to continually keep their skills up to date. “Training is critical to our success. Even in a down year, we have to do some sort of training,” he said.

The environment and trade

Biden has consistently framed his environmental plan as being a boon for job creation. Kentucky-based HempWood manufactures building materials out of industrial hemp, and founder Greg Wilson is one entrepreneur who is optimistic about the potential for business growth.

“Green building policies would be more beneficial for us in the market,” Wilson said, as would incentives for using American-made products in building construction and retrofitting. “We need to make things in America because the American economy is based on services rather than making things. Right now it’s turned upside down.”

Ensuring America’s competitiveness in the midst of widespread economic pain is no small task, but it is necessary in an era of global supply chains. “Trade policy issues are going to potentially have an effect in the medium term,” Strohl said.

Relief from Trump’s trade wars would be a big help, business owners say. “The idea of the tariffs is not wrong and that’s because there are unfair trade practices in China … but the way it's being applied is a disaster,” Wilson said.

HempWood had to buy production equipment from China because no U.S.-based supplier existed for the machines they needed, Wilson said. Although his firm received a tariff exemption, coronavirus-related disruption meant that the equipment arrived on American shores nine days after the exemption expired. “I’ve laid people off because of that tariff,” he said.

Tax policy

“An important distinction between the Republican and Democratic platforms is that Joe Biden puts a lot of weight on spending to stimulate the economy,"" von Wachter said. ""Republicans put more weight on hoping to grow the economy with tax cuts.""

As in 2016, Trump has campaigned on the promise of cutting taxes for businesses, but von Wachter cast doubt on the likelihood of success. “Spending stimulates the economy, whereas there’s much less evidence on tax cuts having a particularly strong effect on growth,” and by extension on job creation.

Trump has pledged to extend the individual tax cuts that expire in 2025, and Biden’s tax plan would effectively expand the child tax credit. Either could bolster demand, a key ingredient in an economy driven predominantly by consumer spending. “Any way you increase spending can increase jobs,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Toder added that building a post-Covid economy gives the White House and Congress both an opportunity and a responsibility to ensure that the tax policies they implement incentivize inclusive economic gains.

“The other issue is, what's our standard of living going to be in the future? Are we going to increase our productivity?” he said.

While the number of jobs added is important, he added, so is making sure that those jobs are stable, safe and pay a living wage. “Tax incentives can help these things if they're designed properly,"" Toder said."

President Donald Trump, like many fellow Republicans, holds out tax reductions and regulatory cuts as economic imperatives and frames himself as a conservative champion in the culture wars. The president has offered few details about how he would pull the levers of government in a second term. His most consistent argument focuses on stopping Democratic opponent Joe Biden and his party from pushing U.S. policy leftward.

Biden, for his part, is not the socialist caricature depicted by Trump. But he is every bit a center-left Democrat who frames the federal government as the force to combat the coronavirus, rebuild the economy and address centuries of institutional racism and systemic inequalities. The former vice president and U.S. senator also offers his deal-making past as evidence he can do it again from the Oval Office.

A look at where the rivals stand on key issues:

ECONOMY, TAXES

Low unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump’s calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market has clawed its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemploymen t stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the pandemic began exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-2009 Great Recession.

Trump has predicted that the U.S. economy will rebound in the third and fourth quarters of this year and is set to take off like a “rocket ship” in 2021. He promises that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics will soon be available, allowing life to get back to normal. His push for a payroll tax cut over the summer was thwarted by stiff bipartisan opposition. But winning a second term — and a mandate from voters — could help him resurrect the idea.

First and foremost, Biden argues that the economy cannot fully recover until COVID-19 is contained. For the long-term recovery, he pitches sweeping federal action to avoid an extended recession and to address longstanding wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans.

His biggest-ticket plans include a $2 trillion, four-year push to eliminate carbon pollution in the U.S. energy grid by 2035 and a new government health insurance plan open to all working-age Americans (with generous subsidies). He proposes new spending on education, infrastructure and small businesses, along with raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Biden would cover some but not all of the new costs by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. He wants a corporate income tax rate of 28% (lower than before but higher than now) and broad income and payroll tax hikes for individuals with more than $400,000 of annual taxable income. All that would generate an estimated $4 trillion or more over 10 years.

Biden frames immigration as an economic matter as well. He wants to expand legal immigration slots and offer a citizenship path for about 11 million residents who are in the country illegally but who, Biden notes, are already economic contributors as workers and consumers.

EDUCATION

Trump has pushed for schools to fully reopen for in-person learning and announced that the federal government will begin distributing millions of rapid coronavirus tests to states. He urged governors to use them to reopen schools for students in kindergarten through 12th grade.

Trump has also used his call for schools to fully reopen as an opportunity to spotlight his support for charter schools and school choice. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime proponent of charter schools and school voucher programs, has suggested that families be allowed to take federal money allotted to school districts that don’t open and spend it on private schools that do open. For most of Trump’s first term, his administration sought major increases to federal charter school grant aid. Congress responded with relatively small increases.

With higher education, Trump has repeatedly complained that campuses are beset by “radical left indoctrination.” He has threatened to defund universities and said he would ask the Treasury Department to reexamine the tax-exempt status and federal funding of unspecified schools.

Biden wants schools to get more federal aid for pandemic-related costs through the same federal law used after national disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.

Beyond COVID, Biden wants the federal government to partner with states to make public higher education tuition-free for any student in a household earning up to $125,000 annually. The assistance would extend to everyone attending two-year schools, regardless of income. He also proposes sharply increasing aid for historically Black colleges. His overall education plans carry a 10-year price tag of about $850 billion.

He calls for universal access to prekindergarten programs for 3- and 4-year-olds; tripling Title I spending for schools with higher concentrations of students from low-income households; more support for non-classroom positions like on-campus social workers; federal infrastructure spending for public school buildings; and covering schools’ costs to comply with federal disability laws. Biden also opposes taxpayer money being routed to for-profit charter school businesses, and he’s pledged that his secretary of education will have classroom teaching experience.

HEALTH CARE

As a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would “immediately” replace President Barack Obama’s health care law with a plan of his own that would provide “insurance for everybody.” Americans are still waiting for his plan.

Trump recently returned to health care amid disapproval of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and growing uncertainty about the future of the Affordable Care Act, which his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn. He is reiterating his 4-year-old promises for quality health care at affordable prices, lower prescription drug costs, more consumer choice and greater transparency.

He also announced executive orders calling for an end to surprise medical bills and declaring it the policy of the U.S. government to protect people with preexisting conditions, even if Obamacare is struck down. However, protections for preexisting conditions are already the law, and Trump would have to go to Congress to cement a new policy through legislation. In the first presidential debate, Trump also held out the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate to have health insurance as significant progress, while ignoring questions about his lack of a comprehensive plan.

Biden wants to expand Obama’s law to provide more generous coverage to a greater number of people and add a “Medicare-like public option” that would compete with private insurers and be available to working-age Americans. Biden estimates that would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 law, and progressives, who want a single-payer system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.

Biden also has sought to turn the current Supreme Court vacancy into a health care matter, noting that the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a key vote in upholding the 2010 health care law, while Trump’s nominee, federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett, has criticized the court’s reasoning in that decision.

CORONAVIRUS

Over the course of the summer, Trump went from acknowledging that the pandemic may “get worse before it gets better” to declaring that the U.S. is “rounding the corner” on the crisis. Then he tested positive for the virus himself.

The pandemic remains the biggest obstacle for his reelection hopes, and his bout with the virus just weeks before Election Day only brightened the spotlight on the issue.

Roughly 7 in 10 Americans think the nation is on the wrong track, and just 39% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the crisis that has killed more than 207,000 people in the U.S., according to a recent poll The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Congress approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in March and April, and Democrats and the White House have been at loggerheads over another significant round of funding, with Trump sending mixed messages on what he wants.

Trump has largely placed responsibility with governors for leading the response.

Biden draws some of his sharpest contrasts with Trump on the pandemic, arguing that the presidency and federal government exist for such crises and that Trump has been an abject failure responsible for tens of thousands of preventable deaths.

Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments. He’s also promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, a wartime law a president can use to direct certain private-sector activity. Additionally, Biden promises to elevate the government’s scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the U.S. rejoin the World Health Organization. He’s also willing to use executive power for a national mask mandate, but whether that is enforceable is questionable.

ABORTION

Years before his run for the White House, Trump described himself as a strong abortion rights proponent. But since coming to Washington, he has been cheered by anti-abortion groups for his administration’s efforts to restrict access to the procedure.

As a candidate and as president, Trump has consistently expressed his opposition to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide and said the issue should be decided by states.

He has expressed support for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits Medicaid from being used to pay for abortions in most circumstances, and he’s sought to restrict access to two drugs that are used to induce abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancies.

In his Republican National Convention speech in August, Trump declared that “children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.” Nominating Barrett, a 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, has the anti-abortion movement hopeful that the high court — should she win confirmation — will tilt decisively to the right and pave the way for the court to eventually overturn the Roe case.

Biden has declined to offer his own list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, but he’s said repeatedly that he supports Roe v. Wade’s finding that the Constitution establishes a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy. He’s endorsed calls for Congress to codify that right, a move that would keep abortion legal statutorily even if the court struck down the constitutional protections.

A practicing Catholic, Biden talked publicly for years of his personal struggle over abortion as a moral issue. He cited that as a reason he supported the Hyde Amendment ban on federal taxpayer funding for abortion services. But he reversed that position early in his 2020 campaign after coming under pressure from women’s groups and Democratic activists. Biden said he wasn’t bowing to pressure but instead argued that Republican legislatures around the country had restricted abortion access to the point that the Hyde Amendment had become an untenable barrier for poor or working-class women to access a constitutional right.

TRADE

Trump views the signing of two major trade deals — an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and Phase 1 of a China agreement — as signature achievements of his presidency. U.S. and China signed Phase 1 in January, less than two months before the pandemic put an enormous strain on U.S.-China relations. Trump says Phase 1 led to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in U.S. agricultural products, energy and other American products. In return, the U.S. canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones, toys and laptop computers. The U.S. also cut in half, to 7.5%, the tariff rate levied on $120 billion in other China imports.

Phase 2 of the deal is expected to focus on some tougher issues between the countries, including Trump’s wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the “China virus,” it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade. Trump recently said he’s currently “not interested” in talking to China.

Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of “fair trade” abroad — a twist on decades of “free trade” talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic firms (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term.

He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms’ research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals. He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world’s other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the U.S., is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president.

FOREIGN POLICY

During his first term, Trump built his foreign policy around the mantra of “America First.”

But in the final lap before Election Day, Trump has been offering himself as an international peacemaker for nudging the Gulf monarchies of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to sign agreements with Israel opening business and diplomatic relations. Trump says other Arab nations are on the cusp of opening formal relations with Israel.

He also counts as major achievements building more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, cajoling more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense spending and reducing the U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan and other hot spots. He also announced his intended withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

Trump can officially withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement — it sets the goal of holding global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — as an example of an agreement that “disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.” The deal, which was signed by Obama, stipulates that no nation can leave until four years after it signed on. For the U.S., that’s Nov. 4 — one day after the U.S. election.

The president has also made clear his desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than the timeline laid out in the Feb. 29 peace agreement with the Taliban, which set the path for U.S. troops to leave the country in 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. There are currently about 4,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and Trump has said he wants them all to be withdrawn by the end of the year.

Trump also counts his engagement with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as a monumental achievement. The president has not been able to prod Kim to give up his nation’s nuclear program, but he has met Kim three times — something Trump critics say has only legitimized the authoritarian leader.

Biden says he would begin “the day after the election” rebuilding relationships with allies ruffled by Trump’s approach, which Biden mocks as “America alone.” Biden’s top priority is reestablishing the foundations of NATO, the post-World War II alliance of Western powers that Biden said is necessary to counter Russia’s aggressive, expansionist aims in eastern Europe and Asia.

Biden also says he would immediately confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country’s interference in U.S. elections. Biden pledges to “end forever wars” but clarifies that U.S. special forces — as opposed to large-scale ground missions — remain a vital part of world stability. He calls for rebuilding a decimated U.S. diplomatic corps, rejoining the Paris climate accord and pushing China and other large economies to reduce carbon pollution."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

President-elect Joe Biden has tapped former Obama aide Brian Deese as director of the National Economic Council, his top economic adviser at the White House.

Deese helped former President Barack Obama rescue the auto industry during the 2009 economic crisis and played a key role in negotiating the Paris climate accords.

But the pick raised the ire of some progressive groups even before it was made official Thursday because of Deese's work for BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.

After his service in the Obama administration, Deese became the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock. Progressive groups say the investment firm holds financial stakes in energy companies that contribute to climate change.

Deese is the second Biden pick to have ties to BlackRock. Wally Adeyemo, Biden's intended nominee for deputy treasury secretary, was chief of staff to the company's CEO.

The selection follows the unveiling Tuesday of six other members of Biden's core economic team, including Janet Yellen, the former Fed chair Biden aims to make the first female Treasury secretary in U.S. history.

Biden lauded Deese in a statement Thursday.

""Brian is among the most tested and accomplished public servants in the country — a trusted voice I can count on to help us end the ongoing economic crisis, build a better economy that deals everybody in, and take on the existential threat of climate change in a way that creates good-paying American jobs,"" Biden said.

In a separate video the transition team put out, the president-elect said of Deese, who's 42: ""He'll be one of the youngest NEC directors in history, but he'll be the first who is a true expert on climate policy.""

In the video, Deese emphasizes that he takes a ""pragmatic and realistic"" approach to issues and had focused on the ""human stakes"" and ""good union jobs"" when he worked on the auto bailout. He pledged to help the United States go further on climate than the commitments made in the Paris Agreement.

But according to groups such as the Revolving Door Project, which is pressuring Biden to keep lobbyists and others with corporate ties out of his administration, and the civil rights group Action Center on Race and the Economy, Deese has not done enough to curb climate change or stand up to corporate interests.

""BlackRock executives like Brian Deese are responsible for financing environmental devastation while profiteering from Black and Indigenous communities,"" Vasudha Desikan, political director of Action Center on Race and the Economy, said in a statement. ""There is a deep bench of highly qualified economic policymakers of color who are dedicated public servants without compromised histories in the private sector.""

But Deese has won praise from others who worked with him on business and environmental issues in the Obama White House.

Deese had yet to finish law school when he was tasked with managing the 2009 auto industry bailout and later rose to replace former White House chief of staff John Podesta as the White House's top climate official.

He was deputy director of both the National Economic Council and the Office of Management and Budget during the Obama administration.

""I can tell you, having been there, that no one worked harder or more effectively to plan and execute the rescue of the American auto industry in the dark, early days of the Great Recession than Brian Deese. He was heroic,"" tweeted David Axelrod, a former senior strategist for Obama.

Deese's backers said his work at BlackRock focused on sustainable investing, and that he is known for his dedication to the environment.

One notable supporter is longtime climate activist Bill McKibben, who has been critical of BlackRock but said that Deese pushed BlackRock to change its policies.

Deese, whose National Economic Council role does not require Senate confirmation, worked on the Paris accords with former Secretary of State John Kerry, who's also returning to the White House. Kerry has been named Biden's special envoy for climate."

Former Vice President Joe Biden offered a scathing criticism of President Donald Trump in a speech from Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday.

The appearance was slated to be about the economy. But before Biden addressed that subject, he reacted to a story in The Atlantic by Jeffrey Goldberg, which reported that Trump allegedly referred to American service members killed in war as “losers” and ""suckers” and canceled a visit to a cemetery for American soldiers outside Paris in 2018 because he didn’t think it was important to honor them.

ABC News has not independently confirmed The Atlantic report, which cites four unnamed sources with direct knowledge in making the claims. Trump has forcefully denied it.

Biden told reporters “quite frankly, if what is written in The Atlantic is true, it’s disgusting. And it affirms what most of us believe to be true, that Donald Trump is not fit to do the job of president, and be the commander in chief.""

""It's deplorable,"" Biden added. ""As I've said many times, I'll say again. These folks are the backbone of America. They're the heart, the soul, the grit. That's what patriotism is about.”

Noting the president’s response after the death of Sen. John McCain Biden said, Trump was “the same guy that when the ship went in the harbor, he made sure the USS McCain was covered [so] we couldn't see it. He's the same guy that denigrated John.""

Biden invoked his late son Beau Biden's memory saying the ""President reportedly said -- and I emphasize reportedly said -- that those who sign up to serve instead of doing something more lucrative are suckers. Let me be real clear. When my son was an assistant U.S. Attorney and he volunteered to go to Kosovo while the war was going on, as a civilian, he wasn't a sucker.""

""When my son volunteered and joined the United States military as the Attorney General, and went to Iraq for a year, won the bronze star and other commendations, he wasn't a sucker,"" he added. ""The servicemen and women he served with, particularly those [who] did not come home, were not losers.""

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Biden's remarks.

Biden then pivoted to the economic fallout from COVID-19 and characterized Trump’s handling of the pandemic as worsening the effects of the economic downturn.

He slammed what he called a K-shaped economy and described what he thought an equitable recovery would look like.

“Economists are starting to call this recession a K-shaped recession, which is a fancy phrase for what's wrong with everything about Trump's presidency.” He added “The ""K"" means those at top are seeing things go up, and those in the middle and below are seeing things go down and get worse. It's no surprise because at root of this is the fact that Trump has mismanaged the COVID crisis and that's why it's a K-shaped pandemic.”

The remarks come after the Bureau of Labor statistics released jobs numbers for August showing that U.S. employers added 1.4 million jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% and after the U.S. stock indices took at deep dive Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 807 points, or approximately 2.8%, at the close. The S &P 500 slipped more than 3.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 4.9%.

Trump touted the jobs numbers Friday on Twitter, saying ""Great Jobs Numbers! 1.37 Million Jobs Added In August. Unemployment Rate Falls To 8.4% (Wow, much better than expected!). Broke the 10% level faster and deeper than thought possible."" In February, before the pandemic hit, the unemployment rate was 3.5%.

Biden and his campaign have consistently sought to paint Trump as a danger to the safety and livelihood of Americans. In remarks Monday, Biden tied simultaneous crises -- the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic fallout from the pandemic and police-related violence -- to Trump's tenure.

""The common thread? An incumbent president who makes things worse, not better,"" Biden said Monday during a speech in Pittsburgh. ""An incumbent president who sows chaos rather than providing order.""

During those remarks, Biden said Americans are living in fear directly because of the president's inaction.

""Mr. Trump, you want to talk about fear? If you know what people are afraid of in America? Afraid they're going to get COVID. Afraid they're going to get sick and die and that's, in no small part, because of you,"" he said.

Biden's ""Build Back Better"" economy plan focuses on a domestic manufacturing and innovation strategy that the campaign says will create 5 million new jobs in addition to the jobs lost due to the coronavirus pandemic. The plan, the campaign says, is not just a response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has decimated parts of the American economy, but is also a broader roadmap to a more equitable economy.

Biden’s plan also proposes investment in green energy and jobs, pledges more affordable child care for families and includes promises of higher wages and benefits for workers. It pledges support to small business owners, extends unemployment benefits and contains a host of proposals to address racial equity, racial gaps in homeownership and wealth."

He will again be overseeing the implementation of an American relief and reinvestment plan after a severe economic downturn. But how well he took the lessons of being “sheriff” of that effort may determine how quickly the country recovers now.

When President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on February 17th, 2009, he appointed Biden to oversee the implementation and operation of the $787 billion effort to rescue the American economy, and to make sure that there was no fraud or waste in the allocated funds.

“Around the White House we call him the Sheriff, because if you're misusing taxpayer dollars, you'll have to answer to him,” President Obama said at the time.

But experts say the overriding focus on making sure dollars were spent correctly traded one mistake for a far greater one. By not spending quickly enough the recession dragged on for longer, causing economic pain and opening the political door to austerity measures that further extended the length of the recovery.

Amid reports that pandemic relief initiatives like the Payroll Protection Program has enriched some fraudsters with taxpayer dollars, officials like Fed Chair Jerome Powell defended the Trump administration’s rapid action, arguing that the scope of the economic crisis was so great that disseminating funds as soon as possible had to be the top priority, even if it meant that a few bad actors slipped through the cracks.

A 2009 Moody’s Analytics study found that growing the food stamps and unemployment insurance programs generated the highest return on the government’s investment, since most of those dollars were spent immediately and funneled back into the economy.

Philip Harvey, a professor of law and economics at Rutgers University School of Law, said that focusing on providing income support directly to individuals and households would sidestep some of these bottlenecks as well as the worry that companies were misappropriating funds.

Recovery Act money, Harvey said, “was not distributed directly to the people. It was all trickle-through and that’s what slowed it down. If the focus is on services to the unemployed and marginalized communities, that would get the money out very quickly.""

Economists say the toughest task Biden will have to tackle when he takes office will be to thread the needle on future stimulus if the Senate remains in Republican hands, as many anticipate. Obama was faulted for overpromising on the Recovery Act, when many economists say that the reality is that it wasn’t big enough to get the job done.

Voter discontent over the slow pace of the recovery manifested in the 2010 midterm elections, which swept in a wave of Tea Party conservatives and threw much of the stimulus momentum into reverse, Zandi said — an about-face that had long-term economic ramifications.

“I think the broadest lesson is we went from stimulus to austerity very quickly — too quickly,” he said. “By 2011, it was all-out austerity… that really slowed the economy and was one key reason why that recovery was painfully slow.”

There is evidence that Biden is turning to some of the same advisors: Jared Bernstein, Biden’s top economist from 2009 to 2011, is one of the names that has been raised as a potential Cabinet pick, an indication that Biden could be returning to at least parts of the same playbook.

Experts say there are a few specific topics on which Biden and his team can draw on models developed and lessons learned in the last recovery.

Tom Guevara, director of the Indiana University Public Policy Institute, said Biden’s pledge to rebuild American manufacturing infrastructure and onshore more production capacity could follow the same kind of strategy that led to the creation of the 2012 public-private consortium dedicated to expanded advanced manufacturing known later as ""Manufacturing USA.""

“I do think the similarities really go to capacity building,” he said. “They gave particularly small and medium sized manufacturers the capability and know-how.”

A key concern for economists is the dire straits of state and local government finances — which also was a factor many say led to the slow and uneven trajectory of the Great Recession recovery.

Providing aid to states and municipalities has been a key sticking point in Covid-19 relief negotiations, as the President and Congressional Republicans have blamed states like New York and California — Democratic strongholds hit early on by Covid-19 — for mismanaging their budgets.

Since those early months, the coronavirus has torn through wide swaths of the country, including much of the red-state heartland. Zandi suggests the immediacy and scope of the public health crisis could prompt a reckoning among lawmakers.

“The reality is the pandemic has not diminished,” Zandi said. “Particularly now that the pandemic is across the country, and red states are suffering a lot more than blue states, maybe that changes the dynamic.”"

Mumbai, India – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been heaping congratulations on US President-elect Joe Biden.

On Wednesday, the two leaders had their first phone call since Biden emerged victorious in the race for the White House.

On November 8 – a day after the former vice president clinched Pennsylvania and enough electoral votes to secure election victory – Modi’s office tweeted images of himself and Biden embracing back in 2014 and 2016.

India’s media has also latched onto the idea of a slow-burning bromance, touting the long-standing relationship between the two.

For the Modi government, these gestures are key to ensuring good relations continue with India’s largest trading partner, as Donald Trump prepares to exit the Oval Office.

In the run-up to the election, critics accused Modi of breaking with practice and tacitly endorsing Trump’s re-election bid during last year’s Howdy Modi! event in Houston.

The Namaste Trump event in Gujarat this February brought Trump and Modi together on stage again, further generating accusations that the Indian prime minister was playing favourites.

But for all the perceived chumminess between Modi and Trump, some analysts believe a Biden White House may prove more beneficial to India and its economy than the outgoing administration.

Less transactional, more multilateral

Biden’s world view is fundamentally different from Trump’s “America First” focus on rebalancing trade deficits.

Some believe the President-elect’s foreign policy could approach trade as part of a broader strategy to deepen ties with global partners and bring a sense of stability back to trade negotiations.

It is also possible Biden could roll back the tariffs that the Trump administration slapped on Indian goods and reinstate the Generalized System of Preferences as a way to rebuild trust and strengthen diplomatic relations.

But a better bromance does not mean all trade tensions are likely to melt away.

“India still has many tariff and non-tariff barriers that irk Americans – even the Obama administration tried to nudge India on this,” Kashish Parpiani, a research fellow at Mumbai-based Observer Research Foundation told Al Jazeera. “Biden will be familiar with these issues and will continue working on them, just not out in the open or as vocally as Trump was”.

Bilateral trade deal not a top priority

While trade negotiations will continue, few see a US-India bilateral free trade deal to be an immediate priority for a Biden White House, given the immense economic challenges the US faces at home.

“You have to look at the situation Biden is inheriting and the current economic environment,” Rupa Chanda, professor of economics at IIM Bangalore told Al Jazeera. “He has to first deal with unemployment domestically and think of the labour unions backing him – I don’t think he will push for any major deals any time soon”.

A bilateral trade deal may not be on the cards at all, said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore.

“We may see the Biden administration renegotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership [TPP) to include India,” he told Al Jazeera, noting that Democrats have long favoured multilateral agreements over bilateral ones.

The TPP was the linchpin of former President Barak Obama’s pivot to Asia. Envisioned as a 12-member pact between the US and other Asia-Pacific nations, it crucially excluded China.

But the TPP withered after Trump pulled the US out of the agreement due to concerns that it could undercut US manufacturing and jobs.

The US’s exit eventually became China’s gain.

Last week, a limited trade deal – the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP – was formally signed by China and 14 other Asia-Pacific nations.

RCEP does not include the US or India. New Delhi withdrew from it last year to shield domestic producers from cheap imports from China and other RCEP partners.

But the successor to the TPP – the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP- could bring strategic benefits to both the US and India.

Biden has not said whether he would rejoin the pact when he takes office. But Palit believes the CPTPP could be re-positioned as an anti-China economic alliance across the Indo-Pacific.

“[RCEP is] seen as a China-driven Free Trade Agreement”, he said.

But analysts are split over whether India would want to opt into any multi-nation trade deal.

“We would have to wait and see what comes out of any renegotiation, but on the whole, we have seen the Modi government reluctant to join multilateral trade pacts,” Priyanka Kishore, head of India and South East Asia for Macro and Investor Services at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera. “At the moment, India is more inclined to pursue bilateral trade agreements which they feel would not disadvantage Indian manufacturers.”

Persistent barriers

Regardless of what kind of trade agreement India enters into, trade barriers to certain imports will almost certainly remain.

Gaining access to India’s agricultural and dairy markets, for example, has consistently blighted trade talks. New Delhi is loath to jeopardise the livelihoods of the country’s small, independent farmers- a politically important voting bloc.

India has also rejected US dairy imports on socio-religious grounds because American cattle are fed blood-meal, a protein-rich supplement made from slaughtered animals.

“India still has many tariff and non-tariff barriers that irk Americans - even the Obama administration tried to nudge India on this. by Kashish Parpiani, a research fellow at Mumbai-based Observer Research Foundation

“A lot of cynics say this is just shadowboxing though,” said ORF’s Kripalani, explaining that India is already nearly self-sufficient in dairy products. “Foreign producers would have to comply with extra certification in order to cater to the Indian market which would raise their costs and make their products too expensive”.

Dairy issues could also raise objections from other CPTPP members, such as Australia and New Zealand, if India joined the pact.

But Palit said the agreement could carve out an exception – a practice not uncommon in multilateral trade deals – and that finding a workaround could prove worthwhile for India if it brings in investment from US agricultural companies.

“India’s recent agricultural reforms show it clearly has ideas to become a regional export hub,” said Palit. “If it allows US companies access, it can expect investments in food processing, storage and logistics in return – this could then make the deal easier for India to sell to constituents at home”.

The US turning more to regional or even global partnerships could also help resolve another thorny issue – digital trade.

India currently insists that companies that handle sensitive data on its consumers must store and process that data in India. This raises problems for US tech giants like Google and Amazon, as well as foreign payment providers like Visa and Mastercard, who rely on cross-border data transfer to operate.

In 2019, the office of the US trade representative described the regulation as “onerous” and also referred to the country’s draft e-commerce policy as one that further “threatens to undermine the digital economy”.

But Malachy Nugent, vice president of financial services at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum believes Biden’s administration is unlikely to take a position on the data issue that runs contrary to its predecessor.

“They would also recognise that data localisation is inefficient and makes it harder to protect consumers from financial fraud and criminal activity,” he told Al Jazeera. “It’s not just a commercial issue. There are some real national security issues at stake, as well”.

We may see increased investment in renewable energy and green technology companies in a way that was not really forthcoming under Trump. by Rupa Chanda, a professor of economics at IIM Bangalore

Nugent suggested that rather than presenting the data issues as a two-way trade dispute, a multilateral approach typical of Democrat-led governments may be more successful.

“If the US can show some leadership here and bring both developed countries and emerging markets to the table, that is the most likely way that these data issues will be resolved,” he said.

The US regaining its position as a leader on the global stage could bring other benefits to India as well.

India is one of the most vulnerable countries in the climate crisis. Biden’s commitment to rejoining the Paris climate accord, as well as rolling back several Trump-era climate deregulation policies, could reignite global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve climate action goals.

The US re-entering the Paris Agreement could also boost India’s tech sector, said IIM Bangalore’s Chanda.

“We may see increased investment in renewable energy and green technology companies in a way that was not really forthcoming under Trump,” he said.

In the nearer term, Biden’s approach to the COVID-19 pandemic could also resonate beyond US borders.

“None of our economies are going to rebound until the pandemic is under control, but now, with Biden in the White House, that looks more likely,” said Nugent.

“The US is one of the major drivers of the global economy – so if it does well, India will benefit indirectly.”"

The Diplomat,"Sat, 07 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlwbG9tYXQuY29tLzIwMjAvMTEvd2hhdC1kb2VzLWJpZGVucy1lbGVjdGlvbi13aW4tbWVhbi1mb3ItdGhlLXNvdXRoLWtvcmVhbi1lY29ub215L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Diplomat,"While the counting is still ongoing in several states, the results suggest former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden has defeated the Republican incumbent, Donald Trump, in the U.S. presidential elections. During the campaign Biden talked at length about issues directly important to Seoul, such as approaching the North Korea nuclear question and managing alliances, but his taking office in South Korea’s second largest trade partner will also likely be of major significance for the country’s economy.

A key pillar of the bilateral economic relationship in recent years has been the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). The deal was first signed in 2007, but only went into force in 2012, after a delay of several years to address U.S. beef and auto concerns. Since then, total annual bilateral trade in goods has steadily increased each year, reaching $134 billion in 2019, up nearly $34 billion from the 2011 pre-agreement baseline. Even before Donald Trump took office and actively pressured foreign companies to invest in the U.S., the agreement also helped to support foreign direct investment (FDI) between the two countries. Compared to 2011, South Korean FDI in the U.S. doubled to over $40 billion by 2015 and was up to $61 billion as of last year, directly supporting nearly 60,000 American jobs in 2017, according to the latest available figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Despite these benefits to the American economy, Trump’s intense focus on the bilateral trade deficit led to a serious strain on the relationship, narrowly avoiding Washington’s withdrawal from the KORUS FTA. Though U.S. exports had risen during some years under the agreement, by the time Trump took office in early 2017 U.S. goods exports to South Korea had slipped below what they were before the agreement, while South Korean goods sent to the U.S. had increased by over $10 billion. Trump’s prescription was to renegotiate what he called “a horrible deal,” even though most experts agreed outside macroeconomic factors – including price fluctuations for U.S. agricultural products – were the underlying cause of the goods deficit, not to mention that Washington’s trade surplus in services with Seoul had grown under KORUS. The amendments both sides agreed to in September 2018 were welcome in that they allowed the White House to claim a win and move on, but they did little in the way of fundamentally shifting the bilateral trade deficit.

While revisiting the KORUS FTA again is just as unlikely to occur under a Biden presidency as it would have been during a second Trump term, Biden is far less likely to inject as much uncertainty into the economic relationship. Trump’s “us vs. them” outlook in his international agenda – made clear in the KORUS renegotiation – as well as his knack for unconventional maneuvers to achieve his goals, such as placing section 232 tariffs on South Korean steel imports on national security grounds, has made it difficult for companies to confidently navigate relationships with the United States. It can be argued that this uncertainty spurred short-term investment and purchases to allay the president’s concerns, but it has constrained long-term planning in what has otherwise been seen as a relatively stable market. Although Biden’s international economic platform has come under criticism for stressing the need to ramp up the domestic economy first, his greater emphasis on cooperation with allies and like-minded countries suggests he will push to stabilize bilateral economic ties.

Biden’s less confrontational approach could also benefit the South Korean economy on the global stage as well. With exports representing around 40 percent of GDP, South Korea’s economic success is intertwined with the rules and norms governing open international markets, which the U.S. played an important part in promoting after World War II, all the way through the Obama administration. Trump’s “zero-sum” agenda contradicted this, but Biden’s outlook – which is slated to better acknowledge the mutual gains from cooperation – could bring Washington back closer to its traditional role, albeit with limitations.

Biden was a major proponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as vice president before Trump pulled the U.S. from the agreement on his first day in office. Biden has stated he would not seek to rejoin, but rather renegotiate U.S. re-entry into the mega-regional trade agreement as president, with a greater focus on labor and environmental issues. Although Seoul was not party to the original agreement or its “Comprehensive and Progressive” successor (CPTPP), it was seriously considering joining – likely even planning to eventually join – before the U.S. dropped out. The agreement is widely seen as key to building stronger trade rules more broadly, which the South Korean economy would assuredly benefit from. Though the CPTPP has been signed and entered into force, without the U.S. it is unclear if its leaders have enough heft to build on the momentum elsewhere.

Looking beyond the TPP, the shift in U.S. policy under Biden could help the South Korean economy in other ways. Without Trump’s singular focus on the bilateral trade deficits in goods, Biden can potentially look toward crucial global issues such as digital trade and green technologies to address climate change, both of which are increasingly vital to South Korea as the government looks to promote these already competitive areas to help recover from the economic fallout from COVID-19. Moreover, Biden’s stance on a more qualified competition with China could facilitate greater cooperation in international institutions dedicated to fighting the economic effects of the pandemic. Trump’s dogged pursuit of laying the blame for the virus on China has hindered a coordinated G-20 emergency response to the crisis as well as led to the United States’ planned withdrawal from the World Health Organization. A better coordinated global response to COVID-19 could mean a faster global recovery, which would mean a stronger bounceback for the South Korean economy.

However, South Korea should not expect a total and complete reversal in U.S. policy, nor for it to happen overnight. The U.S.-China competition – probably the issue of highest concern directly influenced by the election for South Korean companies – is not likely to go away. Biden may look to ease the pressure in certain regards, but may be less inclined to back away from decoupling high-tech value chains in the face of increasingly bipartisan support. Additionally, Biden’s emphasis on addressing economic issues at home first could mean it may take some time for the U.S. to pursue major international economic initiatives. This is compounded by the expiration of congressionally mandated Trade Promotion Authority at the end of June, giving him a very narrow window to get a trade agreement ratified before it would need to go through the process of being renewed. Of course, there are still some low hanging fruits that can be tackled more easily, such as no longer blocking the appointment of judges to the World Trade Organization’s Appellate Body.

Overall, Biden will help to ease some of the tension and uncertainty that Trump has infused bilaterally and at the global level over the past four years, but he will nevertheless be constrained by the realities of a struggling economy at home, shifting geopolitical power, and shaken faith in U.S. leadership. Still, the Biden administration should provide a welcomed window of opportunity to advance key economic priorities shared by both countries and the global community."

With Janet Yellen in line for Treasury secretary, President-elect Joe Biden must now round out a hands-on economic team charged with the delicate but nonetheless enormous task of nursing the U.S. economy back to health. In the coming weeks, the president-elect will nominate a mix of economists and business leaders to helm the Commerce Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Economic Council. He will name a successor to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Kathy Kraninger. A Biden transition team official said Wednesday that the president-elect will name nominees for key economic positions on Dec. 2. Key vacancies also remain on the Federal Reserve's board of governors after the Senate failed to confirm President Donald Trump's handful of recent nominees including Judy Shelton. Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair expires in 2022, a future opening the Biden administration will likely be quick to fill. Biden chose Yellen, who in 2014 made history as the first woman to lead the Fed, as his Treasury secretary, people familiar with the transition team confirmed Monday. If confirmed, Yellen would also be the nation's first woman to serve as Treasury secretary. ""Yellen's selection as presumptive President-elect Biden's nominee for Treasury Secretary indicates an overall focus on economic recovery over regulatory policy and is a positive for markets and the economy as a whole,"" Raymond James analyst Ed Mills wrote. ""The pick's signaled focus on economic recovery makes fiscal support incrementally more likely in 2021,"" he added. ""Comparatively, Yellen will be a more effective voice for expanded fiscal support than other candidates who may have been seen as more partisan."" But whomever Biden choses, a precarious and volatile U.S. economy will from Day One force officials to hit the ground running with an urgent, involved approach. The U.S. economy suffered one of its steepest, briefest recessions earlier in 2020, when several states shuttered or pared back nonessential business to help slow the spread of Covid-19. Gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced across the economy — slumped more than 30% on an annualized basis in the second quarter. The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7%. And tens of millions of U.S. workers filed for jobless benefits for the first time. Though output has partially rebounded since then, the U.S. economy is still about 3.5% smaller than at the end of 2019 and ahead of what's expected to be a difficult winter battle against the coronavirus. Biden himself has lobbied for House Democrats' $2.2 trillion stimulus package to revitalize the economy. But with Senate Republicans more focused on the budget deficit and more targeted aid, administration economists may have to seek other ways to support U.S. commerce after the holiday season.

Trade

Given narrow majorities in both congressional chambers, Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former Treasury official, believes Biden's choice may ultimately have the most immediate impact on everyday Americans. Sheets, who served as undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs under the Obama administration, told CNBC that the president has far more leeway in managing trade relationships compared with tax code changes that require Congress' blessing. ""USTR stands out as an economic post where the issues to be considered—and the opportunities—loom especially large,"" Sheets wrote in an email. ""The head of USTR will play a central role in determining the Administration's positions on a broad set of trade policy issues and, in addition, negotiating the desired outcomes with partners abroad,"" he added. ""These issues include WTO reform, the specifics of a new US policy on China, and determining the appropriate role for tariffs in the policy toolkit.""

Though little is known about whom Biden will choose to lead the U.S. in trade discussions, comments made by the president-elect and named Cabinet nominees on Tuesday may offer insight on a more multilateral, ally-based approach ahead. ""I believe America is strongest when we work with our allies,"" Biden said on Twitter. ""It's how we keep this country safe, counter terrorism and extremism, control this pandemic, deal with the climate crisis, and so much more."" Antony Blinken, a career diplomat and Biden's choice for secretary of State, echoed the president-elect later Tuesday. ""Most of the world's problems are not about us, even as they affect us,"" Blinken said. ""We need to partner with others. Biden will inherit a U.S. trade policy marked by a flurry of Trump-era taxes on global imports: Aluminum and steel from most of the world, on olives, wine and cheese from Europe, and on almost 75% of everything the U.S. buys from China.

Trade representative Lighthizer has also overseen a more oppositional U.S. presence at the World Trade Organization in Geneva, opting instead for bilateral agreements rather than negotiations through multilateral bodies. While Biden has not indicated whether he will remove some or all of the existing tariffs, both Democrats and Republicans may pressure the incoming president to use the levies, or their removal, as a strategic advantage. Republicans, no longer the free-traders of years past, will likely garner support from Democrats in lobbying against unfettered, globalist trade relations.

Advisory councils

Aside from picking a trade representative, Biden and his transition team will need to staff two advisory bodies: the National Economic Council and the Council of Economic Advisers. Sometimes confused for each other, the NEC and CEA serve similar but distinct functions for a sitting president. The NEC, currently directed by Larry Kudlow, was created in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton to collect a large group of agency and department heads to coordinate economic policy. This council, whose prior leaders include Gary Cohn, Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling, is often considered the president's core group of economic advisors. It's considered the ""war room"" for economic policy and seeks to sync priorities across the government.

Given that members of the council do not require congressional approval, the NEC can be staffed with business leaders and other industry-friendly confidants. ""The head of the NEC is perhaps the President's closest advisor on economic issues—someone who is always in the room when important discussions occur and decisions are made,"" PGIM's Sheets wrote. ""For Trump, Gary Cohn and Larry Kudlow were confidential advisors—sharing their views behind closed doors—but also frequent voices in the media explaining Administration policies,"" he added. ""In some other administrations, the head of the NEC has functioned more as a behind-the-scenes quarterback coordinating positions across agencies and formulating recommendations to the President."" The Council of Economic Advisers, by contrast, is usually a smaller team of experts who offer the president advice and possible directions for economic policy in a setting closer to a think tank. Their advice tends to run more academic and offers the White House goals to consider and venture. Potential candidates for these councils are many and include some of then-candidate Biden's outside economic advisors including labor economist Jared Bernstein, tax policy expert Ben Harris and equitability scholar Heather Boushey. The American Prospect reported on Tuesday that BlackRock executive Brian Deese is also under consideration for the NEC.

Federal Reserve

The Biden administration will have a handful of opportunities to nominate candidates to the U.S. central bank. The Fed, in the middle of one of its largest asset purchase and lending campaigns ever, is in charge of setting interest rate and monetary policy. In normal times, officials will raise or lower borrowing costs to cool or spur the U.S. economy, respectively. But during emergencies including the Covid-19 recession, Congress may allow the Fed to deploy extraordinary tools to stabilize markets, provide liquidity to struggling firms and expand its massive portfolio of securities. The biggest prize for the Biden administration will come in 2022, when Powell's four-year term comes to an end. Though the Democrat and his team have not criticized policy moves by Republican Powell (who himself has encouraged more fiscal support from Congress), Biden may elect to nominate an economist with a history of concern for income inequality.

Trump also misrepresented Biden’s position on taxes, again minimized the coronavirus threat and exaggerated his own record on the economy.

A look at some of the past week’s rhetoric and the facts:

ON BIDEN-HARRIS

TRUMP: “If Biden would win … he’s going to double and triple everybody’s taxes.” — News conference Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Trump is exaggerating. Wildly so.

Biden would raise taxes, primarily on the wealthy. But a July estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds that the increase is a small fraction of what Trump claimed. The former vice president’s plan would raise “taxes for the top 1 percent of earners by 13 to 18% of after-tax income, while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 0.2 to 0.6%,” the nonpartisan group said.

To put that in perspective, tax collections would increase by $3.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion over the next decade. That is a lot of money. But it’s not a doubling or tripling. The government is on pace to collect $47 trillion over the next decade, so the Biden plan would roughly be a 7.8% increase in revenues.

___

TRUMP, asked about social media claims that Harris is not eligible to run for vice president because her parents were immigrants to the U.S.: “I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements. … I have no idea if that’s right. I would have assumed that the Democrats would have checked that out.” — News conference Thursday.

THE FACTS: Harris, a senator from California, is without question eligible.

Harris, 55, was born in Oakland, California, making her a natural-born U.S. citizen and eligible to be president if Biden were unable to serve a full term. Her father, an economist from Jamaica, and her mother, a cancer researcher from India, met at the University of California, Berkeley, as graduate students.

The Constitution requires a vice president to meet the eligibility requirements to be president. That includes being a natural-born U.S. citizen, at least 35 years old and a resident in the U.S. for at least 14 years.

“I can’t believe people are making this idiotic comment,” Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University professor of constitutional law, told The Associated Press in 2019, when similar false claims emerged about Harris during her presidential run.

“She is a natural-born citizen and there is no question about her eligibility to run,” Tribe said.

Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket. Trump in past years indulged in the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born abroad.

___

TRUMP CAMPAIGN: “Not long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received.” — statement Tuesday from Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 senior adviser.

THE FACTS: She never called Biden a racist.

Pierson appears to be referring to Harris’ remarks during a Democratic primary debate in Miami in June 2019 when the California senator challenged Biden’s record of opposing busing as a way to integrate schools in the 1970s.

Harris prefaced her criticism by telling Biden at that time, “I do not believe you are a racist. I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.”

She then went on: “It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing.

“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools,” Harris said. “She was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.”

It was a breakthrough moment for Harris at the candidates’ first debate, stunning Biden, who responded that “he did not praise racists” and provided a hairsplitting defense of his position on busing. But she did not accuse him of being racist.

___

SOCIAL SECURITY

TRUMP: “At the end of the year, the assumption that I win, I’m going to terminate the payroll tax … We’ll be paying into Social Security through the general fund.” — News conference Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Under Trump’s proposal, Social Security would lose its dedicated funding source.

Payroll taxes raise about $1 trillion annually for Social Security, and the president was unconcerned about the loss of those revenues. Trump campaign officials stressed that the general fund consists of assets and liabilities that finance government operations and could do so for Social Security. The general fund is nicknamed “America’s Checkbook” on the Treasury Department’s website.

The risk is that the loss of a dedicated funding source could destabilize an anti-poverty program that provides payments to roughly 65 million Americans. It also could force people to cut back on the spending that drives growth so they can save for their own retirement and health care needs if they believe the government backstop is in jeopardy.

A 12.4% payroll tax split between employers and workers funds Social Security, while a 2.9% payroll tax finances Medicare. The Social Security tax raised roughly $1 trillion last year, according to government figures. Over a 10-year period, Trump’s idea would blow a $13 trillion hole in a U.S. budget that is already laden with rising debt loads.

Trump announced a payroll tax deferral through the end of the year, part of a series of moves to bypass Congress after talks on a broader coronavirus relief bill that has stalled. He says he will make it a permanent tax cut with the help of Congress. Democrats have described that idea as a nonstarter.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday suggested to reporters that Trump misspoke when he said he would eliminate the payroll tax if reelected. She said the president would only push to make the payroll tax deferrals permanent. But Trump clearly said that he would eliminate the payroll tax four times at his Wednesday press briefing and even answered a question about “permanently” rescinding it.

___

TRUMP, asked how the general fund can sustain the payments: “We’re going to have tremendous growth. … You will see growth like you have not seen in a long time.” — News conference Wednesday.

THE FACTS: It is highly unlikely that economic growth would be enough to offset the loss of the payroll tax. Trump has a record of making wildly improbable growth projections. He suggested that his 2017 income tax cuts would propel economic growth as high as 6% annually. That never happened. Growth reached 3% in 2018, then slumped to 2.2% and the U.S. economy crumbled into recession this year because of the coronavirus.

___

VIRUS THREAT

TRUMP, on COVID-19: “Nobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is, in 1917, they say — right? The great — the great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing, where they lost, anywhere from 50 to 100 million people. Probably ended the Second World War; all the soldiers were sick.” — news briefing Monday.

THE FACTS: He got the year wrong for the Spanish flu, as he routinely does, and may have overstated deaths from it. The pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920. It killed an estimated 50 million worldwide, with about 675,000 of the deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That pandemic did not end World War II, which came two decades later.

___

TRUMP: “We’re still in the pandemic, which will be going away, as I say, it will be going away. And they scream, how you can you say that? I said, because it’s going to be going away.” — interview Thursday on Fox Business Network.

THE FACTS: No matter how many times he says it, the virus is not going to just magically disappear.

The virus is now blamed for more than 166,000 deaths and more than 5.2 million confirmed infections in the U.S. — easily the highest totals in the world. In the past week, the average number of new cases per day was on the rise in eight states, and deaths per day were climbing in 26, according to an Associated Press analysis.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases official, has warned that increased cases across the South and West in particular put “the entire country at risk.” On Thursday, for instance, the rate of positive virus cases in Texas soared to the highest levels of the pandemic, with nearly 1 in every 4 coronavirus tests coming back positive. Nevada had its biggest daily jump in coronavirus fatalities to date.

In February, Trump asserted coronavirus cases were going “very substantially down, not up,” and said it will be fine because “in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.”

Fauci says there “certainly” will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter.

TRUMP, on whether he still thinks kids are essentially immune from COVID-19: “Yeah, I think that, for the most part, they do very well. I mean, they — they don’t get very sick. They don’t catch it easily.” — news briefing Tuesday.

THE FACTS: They aren’t immune, and he ignores racial disparities among those kids who get infected.

Although it’s true that children are less likely than adults to develop COVID-19, the CDC has nevertheless counted more than 250,000 infections by the virus in Americans younger than 18, or roughly 7% of all cases. Racial disparities in the U.S. outbreak also extend to children, with Hispanic and Black children with COVID-19 more likely to be hospitalized than white kids.

The total number of kids who have been infected but not confirmed is almost certainly far higher than the CDC figures, experts say, because those with mild or no symptoms are less likely to get tested. Trump also glosses over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves.

The CDC in May also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but life-threatening inflammatory reaction in some children who’ve had the coronavirus. The condition had been reported in more than 100 children in New York, and in some kids in several other states and in Europe, with some deaths.

Two recent government reports laid bare the racial disparities.

One of the CDC reports looked at children with COVID-19 who needed hospitalization. Hispanic children were hospitalized at a rate eight times higher than white kids, and Black children were hospitalized at a rate five times higher, it found.

The second report examined cases of the rare virus-associated syndrome in kids. It found that nearly three-quarters of the children with the syndrome were either Hispanic or Black, well above their representation in the general population.

ECONOMY

TRUMP: “The manufacturing sector is booming and the production index is at the highest reading since October of ’18, which was an extraordinary period of time.” — News conference Wednesday.

THE FACTS: The pandemic crushed U.S. factories and the damage persists. There is no boom.

Even after three months of job gains, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the manufacturing sector has 740,000 fewer jobs than before the outbreak. All the factory hiring gains under Trump have disappeared. There were 257,000 more manufacturing jobs on the day Trump became president than now. More importantly, the jobs recovery has shown signs of stalling. Just 26,000 factory jobs were added in July, down from 357,000 added jobs in June.

The sector has been recovering. Yet after increases in production in June, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output was running 11.1% below pre-pandemic levels. Trump cited one component of an index composed by the Institute for Supply Management that indicates factory production grew in July as well. It was the best reading since August of 2018, not October as claimed by the president. But that same report showed that manufacturers are also cutting back on employment, suggesting that a boom has yet to begin.

TRUMP, on tariffs on China: “We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never took 10 cents from China, never — not even 10 cents.” — news conference Monday.

THE FACTS: It’s false to say the U.S. never collected a dime in tariffs on Chinese goods before he took action. They are simply higher in some cases than they were before. It’s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by China. Tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from U.S. businesses and consumers, not from China. Tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically.

MAIL VOTING

TRUMP: Universal mail-in voting is “a system riddled by fraud and corruption.” — News conference Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Voting fraud actually is very rare.

The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

Five states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

“Trump is simply wrong about mail-in balloting raising a ‘tremendous’ potential for fraud,” Richard L. Hasen, an elections expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law, wrote recently. “While certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absentee-ballot scandals, problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on vote-by-mail, including the heavily Republican state of Utah.”

NEW YORK VOTING

TRUMP: “You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race. They should do that race over, by the way. … When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds — nobody knows what’s going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner.” — News conference Wednesday.

THE FACTS: There’s no evidence of fraud in the Democratic congressional primary in New York City that was won by Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney. Nor did Trump offer any proof of fraud.

New York State decided to allow anyone to vote by mail in the June primary because of the pandemic. More than 400,000 people voted by absentee ballot in New York City, a figure that was 10 times the number of absentee ballots cast in the 2016 primary.

Opening and counting those ballots by elections officials took weeks, leading to a legal dispute over nonfraud issues, such as missing postmarks. Candidates observing the count say that thousands of ballots were disqualified because of technical errors voters wouldn’t have encountered if they had voted in person, like problems with their signature.

New York City’s Board of Elections ultimately certified the results six weeks after the election.

With a blue “Build Back Better” placard on his lectern, the former vice president sought to signal that the coronavirus crisis will not displace the imperative to act on climate. Instead, he framed the immediate and long-term crises as linked, requiring the same sort of government intervention: a massive program to ramp up electric vehicles, carbon-free power and energy efficiency throughout the economy.

“These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of the American economy and the safety of the American people,” Biden said in a speech from Wilmington, Delaware, his hometown.

“Here we are now with the economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity not just to build back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead,” he said. “And there is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in this next decade than the onrushing climate crisis.”

The planned $2 trillion federal investment marks a step up from the $1.7 trillion plan Biden unveiled during the Democratic primary battle. He also is accelerating his timetable for action, seeking to put the United States on track to achieve net zero emissions four years earlier than his original goal of 2050.

Those changes come after a concerted effort by his campaign to craft a unity platform with supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was his final challenger in the Democractic primaries and a revered figure among the party’s progressive wing.

Given the electoral map advantages for Republicans, most political observers agree that Biden will need to inspire both the left and moderates in his effort to unseat President Donald Trump, despite his current lead in most national polls.

Rolling out a more aggressive plan on climate is seen by many as a way that Biden can win over young and progressive voters. At the same time, Biden sought to reach out to blue-collar workers with an emphasis on union wages and benefits and manufacturing jobs in a new green economy.

“When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer,” said Biden, expanding on a riff that was a favorite of climate champion Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington, early in the primary season. “When I think about those wind-farms, I see American manufacturing—and American workers—racing to dominate the global market.”

Inslee quickly offered his endorsement of Biden’s plan, calling it “visionary.”

For Summer Dean, 23, a climate and energy justice activist, writer, and model who works with the Sunrise Movement in Los Angeles, the new Biden plan represents a powerful testament to the mass mobilization of youth climate activists from around the country. After Bernie Sanders’ withdrawal from the Democratic presidential primary in April, many of them fiercely devoted their time to pressuring Biden to ramp up his ambition on climate.

“This new plan is the most aggressive and intersectional climate plan from any Democratic nominee in history,” said Dean. “Any adequate plan to address the climate crisis must also be a plan to recover our broken economy, and center those who have been disenfranchised in the solutions. Biden’s new plan shows that his campaign gets it, and it will resonate with voters.”

Alexandria Villaseñor, 15, co-founder of the U.S. Youth Climate Strike and founder of Earth Uprising, is equally inspired. “It’s no secret the youth climate justice movement has not been a fan of Joe Biden,” she said. “However, with the announcement of this plan, which acts on science and centers on environmental justice and communities of color, he’s saying that he’s listening and willing to act on some of the most critical issues of our generation.”

Biden’s plan would establish for the first time a separate office of environmental and climate justice at the Justice Department. A goal would be addressing how “environmental policy decisions of the past have failed communities of color.”

Disadvantaged communities would receive 40 percent of the clean energy and infrastructure benefits. New monitoring of pollution would be mandated in communities at the fenceline of refineries and other facilities that have borne the brunt of the nation’s pollution burdens.

The Biden plan is consistent with a recent call for a massive reinvestment in coal communities across the nation, written by members of those communities, said Thom Kay, the senior legislative representative of Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit that works for healthy ecosystems and resilient local economies in coal country.

That coal transition platform from the Just Transition Fund was endorsed by 80 groups, from environmental to business to labor, based in part on the premise that the nation has a moral obligation to help coal-dependent communities transition to new economies because of the sacrifices they have made.

With its provisions for worker health in coal communities, the importance of broadband in rural communities, and major investments in reclaiming damaged mining sites, there’s a lot to like in the Biden plan, Kay said.

“We love the idea of 250,000 good jobs on various types of reclamation,” Kay said. “We love to see that out there.”

Coal community residents for years have been saying that cleaning up messes left behind by the industry can put former miners to work while boosting economic development.

“I do hope that we continue to have good unity of labor and environmental groups trying to have a brighter future for these coal communities,” he said.

Biden emphasized that his plan would support “good paying union jobs” and said the auto industry would benefit from a transition to electric vehicles.

The United Auto Workers, representing 400,000 active workers in one of the nation’s largest manufacturing sectors, praised Biden’s emphasis on union jobs, and the transition to electric vehicles.

The union issued a statement calling Biden’s plan “a win-win for American manufacturing, auto industry jobs, new technology and a cleaner environment.” The union’s support could be important for Biden in Michigan, the No. 1 automaking state, which Trump narrowly won in 2016 but Democrats swept in the 2018 midterms.

“UAW members are looking to Washington, D.C. to invest in future jobs; new technologies; a world race to cleaner air; and to save consumers their hard-earned money,” said the UAW. “This plan checks all those boxes.”

In another key state for the Democrats in November, Colorado Democrats welcomed the Biden climate plan enthusiastically. Eager to see voters replace Republican incumbent Sen. Cory Gardner with former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, and with two tight congressional contests, the state party is also pleased to see the likely Democratic presidential nominee making the environment, public lands and climate change leading issues in the 2020 campaign.

“Climate change is one of our top priorities here in Colorado,” said David Kim Pourshoushtari, spokesman for the Colorado Democratic Party. Clean energy, clean jobs, preserving outdoor recreation and promoting the outdoor products industry—they’re important to voters in a state that’s generally regarded as purple, and fiercely competitive, Pourshoushtari said.

The Biden plan “creates a huge contrast between the two parties,” Pourshoushtari added, noting that Trump chose a former oil and gas lobbyist to lead his Interior Department and a one-time opponent of federal lands programs to lead its Bureau of Land Management.

The Biden campaign made clear its hope that the climate plan would appeal to Coloradans, announcing that the former vice president’s wife, Jill Biden, will take a virtual tour of Pipefitters Local 208 Training Facility in Denver on Friday, followed by a “listening session” on the Biden economic recovery plan.

Not all Westerners were happy with Biden’s plan. Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas industry trade group, linked the Biden plan with the Green New Deal, saying it fueled “alarmism about climate change while envisioning a radical remaking of the energy sector and hence, the economy,” just as the nation is trying to recover from the Covid-19 recession. She called Biden’s net-zero GHG emissions goals “unrealistic” and conveniently timed. Sgamma noted that electricity from natural gas has cut greenhouse gas emissions more than wind and solar combined, and she said Biden’s strategy ought to focus on furthering that success rather than disadvantaging American producers.

“We’ll focus on moderating these policies once Biden moves from appeasing the left during the campaign to potentially governing,” Sgamma said. “His vulnerability in Pennsylvania, which has caused him to tone down the rhetoric on banning fracking, suggests there is room to be reasonable on these issues.”

The Trump campaign, for its part, sought to paint Biden’s climate plan as extreme.

“His plan is more like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class,” said Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley in a statement.

The Biden campaign said that details on paying for the plan would be forthcoming and would include increasing the corporate income tax rate from 21 to 28 percent.

Although polls have pointed to the environment as Trump’s biggest vulnerability against Biden, the president’s campaign showed no sign of acknowledging the need to address climate change.

“Now more than ever, it’s clear that Biden is beholden to the radical socialist ideology of Senator Bernie Sanders, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” Gidley said.

But that’s not how it looks on the Democratic left, where progressives still see more work to do in moving Biden to do more.

“I think it’s a step in the right direction, but that doesn’t mean that it’s enough,” said Jamie Margolin,18, who co-founded the international youth climate justice coalition Zero Hour and served as a surrogate for the Bernie Sanders campaign. In her view, Biden “still needs to be pushed to be even stronger on this issue,” including by doing more to put climate justice at the forefront of his agenda.

She added, “To be honest, there’s still a long way to go.”

Margolin, who plans to cast her first vote in the upcoming presidential election, said she wants to make sure Biden’s plan puts the nation on track to reaching net zero emissions by 2030. “We have to adapt to what the science needs; the science can’t adapt to our political climate.”

Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement, who served on the Biden-Sanders climate task force, said activists can take credit for the moves by Biden to increase the scale and urgency of climate investments. But she said their work is not over.

“Our movement made this possible, but there’s more work to do, and the urgency of the crisis demands that we keep pushing,” Prakash said. “Two things are clear: Movements matter, and there’s more work to do.”"

The numbers offer one reason why the election could become close again, and despite Biden’s consistent lead in the poll overall, they suggest a way the president could still tip the race back in his favor.

Overall, Biden leads Trump by 9 points in a head-to-head matchup in the survey and behind that edge is a list of issues where the Democratic challenger outperforms the president.

On a majority of issues Biden does better than Trump, including on his ability to “bring the country together,"" where 49 percent believe Biden is the better choice, compared to 26 percent for the president. Biden also does better than Trump on dealing with race relations, 53 percent to 29 percent, and on dealing with the coronavirus, 49 percent to 33 percent.

Considering the headlines of the last few months, that’s an important set of topics. The racial and political divisions in the country have been a major topic of conversation in the country since the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests. And the continued rising death count from COVID-19, now at almost 170,000, has shaken the country this summer.

Trump, meanwhile, leads with voters on far fewer issues in the poll, but his main strength, how to handle the economy, is usually a big driver at election time.

Trump holds a narrow lead on the issue of which candidate would better deal with crime, 43 percent versus 39 percent for Biden. And Trump does slightly better with voters who are worried about the candidate “having the necessary mental and physical health to be president,” 39 percent to 37 percent for Biden. But the president’s edge on the economy is sizable, and he holds a 48 percent to 38 percent advantage over Biden on that topic.

That 10-point edge may be Trump’s best bet to move the polls and change the race before November. The NBC News/WSJ survey suggests that as of right now, the economy is the main issue on people’s minds.

More than half of all voters, 51 percent, say a candidate’s ability to “deal with the economy” is the first or second most important issue in determining their vote. That was the only issue in that “most important” group that broke 50 percent.

But on other top issues, Biden was the candidate of choice, and often by large margins.

In the survey, 43 percent said having a candidate who can “bring the country together” was a top concern and among those voters Biden held a 23-point edge. A third of voters said they cared most that the next president had “strong leadership qualities,"" and Biden held a 4-point edge among them. And more than a quarter of voters said their top issue was which candidate could better deal with health care and the coronavirus; Biden held 16-point advantages among voters who most cared about those issues.

The numbers raise a lot of questions as the campaign year heads into the stretch run.

Can Trump, who is not known for being a disciplined candidate, focus on the one issue where he has the best traction with voters? Can he maintain that edge if the unemployment rate continues to hold in the double digits during the pandemic? And in 2020, where the big events keep coming, is it better to lead on the always important “economy” issue or on the raft of other matters that are dominating the news, including the pandemic?

Right now, with Biden holding a 9-point lead in the poll overall, the economy alone doesn’t appear to hold the power it usually does. The Trump campaign has about 12 weeks to figure out how to change that storyline."

""This man simply doesn't understand,"" Biden said of Trump in his remarks. ""He can't deal with our economic crisis without serving and saving and solving the public health crisis. For all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he's unable to explain how he'll actually help the working families hit the hardest. You know, he's quit on you and he's quit on this country.""

Biden's plan, which senior Biden officials outlined to reporters on a call Monday night, centers around expanding access to long-term care for elderly and disabled Americans, as well as creating accessible, safe childcare options for working parents. The plan would create 1.5 million new jobs in both fields, and would also focus on increasing pay for caregivers and early childhood educators, say advisers.

""We're trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis, within a health care crisis. You're doing everything you can, but this president is not,"" Biden said Tuesday in a policy-centric and at times personal speech that touched on his own experience as a single father after losing his first wife and daughter in a car accident in the early 1970s.

""I understand, to my very core. And I also know that together we can do this. This is America. We don't settle. We aspire. And we succeed,"" Biden said of the issues facing working families.

The plan, the campaign said, will be combined with Biden's pledge to provide 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, and would create ""job-enabling jobs,"" allowing an additional 2 million workers who have had to stay home with a loved one to return to the workforce -- creating 5 million jobs in total.

According to a 10-page summary detailing the policy, the plan would first focus on keeping current workers employed by providing ""states, tribal and local governments with the fiscal relief they need"" to retain their workers, as well as keeping child and long-term care services operating during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

""It is a time of huge anxiety for parents who are watching the impacts of having their kids out of school or out of care for an extended period of time,"" a senior Biden official said on the call Monday night.

""It's an enormous economic weight on the parents who have really an impossible choice to make: Care for their children, or go to work to earn a paycheck. The financial burden and the emotional burden are massive for parents who are just trying to do right by the kids,"" the official said.

While the plan was billed as a pillar of his overall plan to restore and grow the economy, Biden, throughout his remarks, spoke about his personal connection to the plight of working parents and individuals caring for elderly or ill loved ones, and framed the policy as helping women in particular, who often fill the caregiving role.

""As many of you know, I was a single parent for five years after my wife and daughter were killed and my two boys were badly injured. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of people going through tough times today, it was hard,"" Biden said.

""We know so many of you are going through the same thing without the kind of help I had, but now everything, everything feels different. There's just that feeling, that sense, when you just don't know if everything is going to turn out OK,"" he said.

Biden's plan for long-term care would provide more funding to states to help end the waitlist for home and community services under Medicaid, while also putting an emphasis on recruiting and training new health professionals, creating 150,000 new community health positions, and establishing new long-term care options, according to advisers.

Also in the new plan is the creation of a Public Health Jobs Corps made up of at least 100,000 Americans from local communities to help identify individuals at risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like COVID-19, help provide COVID-19 vaccinations to at-risk populations when they are available, and provide support to low-income communities, minority communities and older adults who are at the highest risk from the virus.

The plan also aims to build up the nation's childcare infrastructure by delivering on Biden's long-held promise to provide all 3- and 4-year-olds access to free pre​-kindergarten education, as well as tax credits for low-income and middle-class families to help pay for the care.

""For children under the age of 5, no family earning below 1.5 times the median income in their state will have to pay more than 7% of their income for quality care, which was ​the ​affordable childcare​ benchmark set by the Obama-Biden Administration,"" says the the plan summary. ""A typical family will pay no more than ​$45 per week​.""

Biden's plan will also seek to accelerate the construction of newer, safer childcare facilities, increase pay to teachers and education workers, and provide legislation that would expand those workers' right to collectively bargain.

Unlike the other pillars of his economic policy, Biden's campaign included how this portion of the plan would be paid for.

According to the summary released by the campaign, the plan will cost $775 billion over 10 years and will be paid for by ""rolling back unproductive and unequal tax breaks for real estate investors with incomes over $400,000 and taking steps to increase tax compliance for high-income earners.""

This plan also builds on Biden's proposals to support informal caregivers -- family members or loved ones who do this work unpaid -- by including a ​$5,000 tax credit​ for informal caregivers, ​as well as Social Security credits​ for people who care for their loved ones, and ​professional and peer support​ for caregivers of wounded, injured, or ill active-duty service members and veterans​.

This is the third pillar of Biden's Build Back Better economic policy, and follows the release of the domestic manufacturing and innovation and environmental and green energy infrastructure portions of the plan.

The plan also includes a final, forthcoming pillar focused on ""advancing racial equity"" and closing the racial wealth gap, according to the campaign."

""Trump may have forgotten about coronavirus, but we have 20 million unemployed,"" Biden told a round-table discussion with community leaders in Philadelphia. ""The federal government has abdicated any effective White House role.""

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Republican Trump ""basically has a one-point plan: opening businesses. He does nothing to keep workers safe.

""Secondly, he's done little to generate consumer confidence,"" Biden said.

With more than 13% unemployed in the U.S., Biden offered his own recovery plan focused on the safe return of workers to their jobs. While the number of confirmed coronavirus victims has diminished in New York, the hardest-hit city in the U.S., new outbreaks are spiking in less populous states.

Hundreds of Americans are dying every day from the coronavirus, with the death toll now topping 113,000.

Biden said if he is elected and assumes the presidency in January 2021, he would call for government-funded coronavirus tests for all workers returning to their jobs, as well as any personal protective equipment they need, such as face masks.

Biden, wearing a mask dangling from his left ear but not covering his face, said he would also advance a proposal to have the federal government pay the salaries of any workers sickened by the virus while they are recovering and also reimburse their salaries if they are forced to take time off to care for family members with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

He said the government should ""set rigorous standards for how it's safe to reopen"" businesses and impose ""tough fines for businesses who don't comply.""

In a statement provided by his campaign after the event began, Biden also promised to create a national contact tracing group and to launch a ""safer for shoppers"" program, in which businesses would be identified that have met coronavirus testing standards and other criteria.

At the Philadelphia event, Biden was seated at the center of several tables, while other people sat at appropriate social distances away from him. The campaign said temperature checks were done for everyone attending the event.

Not only would a Joe Biden presidency get rid of the Second Amendment and raise taxes, the president said, but it would also cause an economic depression.

“You could forget about the Second Amendment if we lose this election,” he said. “And your taxes will be doubled, tripled and quadrupled. Your jobs will be gone. I mean, you’re going to have a depression, if that happens… The biggest single headwind [to the stock market] is if he got in.”

Despite those statements, Biden has not announced plans to change the Second Amendment. The Democratic nominee does favor rolling back the Trump tax cuts, which primarily benefited the wealthy and large corporations.

BIDEN'S PLAN TO COMBAT THE CORONAVIRUS

When Trump was first elected, he said the stock market rose “like a rocket ship.” But if Biden were to win, the economy would plummet, and 401(k)s would see a 40 to 50% decline.

“All this stuff that you’re talking about is going to kill our country and kill the economy,” he said.

Although stocks have gone up since their March lows, the U.S. is currently in the midst of an economic downturn with over 30 million Americans collecting some form of unemployment benefits as of late July.

Trump mentioned Biden’s competence could be concerning when dealing with foreign leaders like China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, who are all “very sharp.”

“If you’re not at the top of your game, it’s not going to be a pretty picture,” he said. “It’s like chess masters. And if you’re not a great chess master, you’re going to have a problem.""

On Thursday, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee aimed to change that as Biden unveiled the broad strokes of his “build back better” blueprint to revive the United States economy from the ravages of COVID-19-induced recession, while casting Trump as an unrelatable, divisive leader who has failed to tackle the nation’s most pressing problems.

Speaking in northern Pennsylvania near his boyhood home of Scranton – a town synonymous with blue-collar, working-class Americans that helped Trump win the battleground state in 2016 – Biden told a socially distanced audience, “Enough his enough. It’s time to reverse the priorities in this county.”

Emphasising the need to tackle income and racial inequalities and build resilience against future threats, Biden served up his vision to resuscitate US manufacturing, modernise the nation’s infrastructure, promote clean energy, bolster critical stockpiles and create millions of secure, well-paying union jobs.

Achieving that vision involves sinking $700bn in federal funds into government investment and procurement programmes including $400bn to buy products made in the US, and $300bn to foster innovation in burgeoning industries such as battery technology, AI, biotech and clean energy.

“My plan will create at least five million – five million – new, good-paying jobs,” Biden told the audience.

To fund that investment, Biden said he would raise the corporate tax rate – which Trump’s controversial Tax Cut and Jobs Act slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent – back up to 28 percent.

Biden also previewed other elements of his plan that he pledged to roll out in the coming weeks, including making child and elder care more affordable for working families.

“Donald Trump has no idea what it’s like to be a single parent barely getting by,” he said. “He doesn’t have a clue what it’s like to provide for an aging parent.”

Emphasising his folksy, humble roots, and the struggles he faced as a single parent, Biden cast Trump as out of touch with the struggles and priorities of ordinary people by taking aim at one of the president’s favourite metrics for gauging economic strength – the stock market.

“The truth is throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been singularly focused on the stock market, the Dow and the Nasdaq. Not you, not your family,” Biden said.

A Gallup poll last month found slightly more than half of the country – 55 percent – are invested in the stock market.

The major US indexes have been on a tear since hitting historic lows in March. But many analysts have highlighted the sharp divergence between the strong rebound in equity markets versus economic data that shows an unequal recovery that by some measures started decelerating in June. And data on Thursday showed more than 30 million Americans are collecting unemployment benefits from state and federal programmes.

Notably absent from Biden’s speech on Thursday was any mention of big, bold policies favoured by some progressive Democrats, such as The Green New Deal.

With less than five months to go until Americans go to the polls, the economy is one area where Biden is playing catch up with Trump.

A recent poll by Pew Research found that while 54 percent of registered voters would either choose or were leaning towards electing Biden, compared with 44 percent for Trump, when it comes to economic policy, half of voters – 51 percent – said they were very or somewhat confident Trump would make good decisions, compared with 48 percent for Biden."

The president-elect also named Cecilia Rouse to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Both the selections of Yellen and Rouse will make history, as Yellen would be the first woman to serve as treasury secretary if she is confirmed by the Senate, and Rouse would be the first woman of color to chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Biden's transition team formally announced their selections on Monday, as well as Wally Adeyemo to serve as Yellen's deputy at the Treasury Department, and Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey to join Rouse on the Council of Economic Advisers. If confirmed, Adeyemo would be the first Black deputy secretary of the Treasury.

""As we get to work to control the virus, this is the team that will deliver immediate economic relief for the American people during this economic crisis and help us build our economy back better than ever,"" Mr. Biden said in a statement. ""This team is comprised of respected and tested groundbreaking public servants who will help the communities hardest hit by COVID-19 and address the structural inequities in our economy. They will work tirelessly to ensure every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead, and that our businesses can thrive and outcompete the rest of the world.""

Noting the diversity of his selections, the president-elect said his economic team ""looks like America and brings seriousness of purpose, the highest degree of competency, and unwavering belief in the promise of America.""

Despite President Trump's false assertions he won the presidential election, Mr. Biden has charged ahead with the presidential transition, announcing top members of his administration and senior White House aides. Last week, the president-elect introduced the nation to several Cabinet nominees and national security and foreign policy appointees, and this week, Mr. Biden is expected to announce members of his economic team. The president-elect plans to nominate Neera Tanden, president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, to serve as his first White House budget director.

Like with the expected appointments of Yellen and Rouse, several of Mr. Biden's Cabinet picks would break barriers.

A labor economist who currently serves as professor emerita at the University of California at Berkeley, Yellen was also the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, a position she held from 2014 to 2018. She was confirmed with bipartisan support for that post. Mr. Trump selected Jerome Powell to succeed Yellen as chair of the central bank. She also chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 1999.

Rouse, meanwhile, served on the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration and is the dean of Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs.

Mr. Biden's expected selection of Yellen was lauded by Democrats when it was first reported last week, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who called the former Fed chair an ""outstanding choice"" who has ""stood up to Wall Street banks."" Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said he looks forward ""to discussing with [Yellen] a variety of issues, especially the requirement for CARES Act temporary emergency lending facilities to shut down by year-end and remain shut down, absent congressional action.""

The president-elect and his economic team are set to take office after the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy, with millions of Americans out of work, local and state governments facing a cash crunch, and businesses nationwide struggling to remain afloat.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been engaged for months in negotiations over another coronavirus economic package that would provide much-needed relief to Americans, but have been unable to reach a deal."

Markets fell Tuesday afternoon after President Donald Trump ordered his surrogates to stop negotiating additional stimulus, but rose Wednesday morning after he pushed for piecemeal relief in a string of late-night and morning tweets. This whipsawing illustrates what a growing number of Wall Street participants are concluding: That a “blue wave” in November is the nation’s best shot at economic recovery. While markets generally cheer the lower tax rates and regulatory rollbacks championed by Republican administrations such as Trump’s, the unprecedented job loss and economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic has left many observers concluding that a united government — even under a party that has historically been seen as a foe by corporate America — might be better equipped to provide the critical fiscal support a bitterly partisan Congress cannot.

The unprecedented job loss and economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic has left many observers concluding that a united government might be better equipped to provide the critical fiscal support a bitterly partisan Congress cannot.

“Investors are left to wonder if the election will deliver a White House and Congress intent and able to get something or done, or willing to risk a nascent recovery petering out,” said James McCann, senior economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

“With both houses of Congress and the White House controlled by Democrats, any spending measures would meet very little resistance,” said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.

On Tuesday, Fed Chair Powell addressed the need for more fiscal stimulus for American families and small businesses in more forceful terms than he has used previously, saying the fallout of failure to do so in short order could be “tragic.”

In a new research note, Goldman Sachs analysts predicted a bullish 5.8 percent GDP growth for 2021 — but said it would be higher still if Democrats swept both chambers of Congress and the White House. “A blue wave would likely prompt us to upgrade our forecasts,” they said, because expected fiscal stimulus and investments in infrastructure, climate, health care and education would, in effect, cancel out the economic hit of higher taxes on big corporations and the rich.

“A hallmark of the Trump administration was rolling back regulations and decreasing corporate taxes, and people would argue that has, in fact, promoted growth,” said Dan North, senior economist at Euler Hermes North America. “Obviously, the Democratic argument is corporations should pay their fair share of taxes and regulations, particularly environmental regulations, need to be enhanced.”

North predicted that a Joe Biden administration backed by Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate would reverse the GOP tax cuts and either reinstate or strengthen regulations. Analyst estimates differ on the economic impact these changes would have over the long term, market observers say a much more immediate risk faced by Wall Street and Main Street alike is the teetering economic stability of a growing number of families and small businesses.

“Without a fifth stimulus coming in quick fashion, there’s some real pain coming to the parts of the economy that directly affect consumers,” Buchanan said.

With consumer spending the biggest driver of economic activity, experts say preserving, supplementing or replacing household income is paramount. “If you look at the macro data in terms of income, income has totally dropped off and now you’ve got people facing utility shutoffs [and] increasing incidents of hunger,” North said.

“As the virus lingers on, as economic damage lingers on… it’s really hard to put parameters around how much worse it can get,” Buchanan said.

If a gridlocked Congress can’t deliver more spending relief, “It’s hard to imagine a vibrant growth economy coming back to the U.S. anytime soon,” Buchanan added."

News that President-elect Joe Biden intends to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen — the first fed chair to acknowledge the problems caused by inequality — to serve as treasury secretary broke yesterday. During her time as chair of the Federal Reserve, Yellen was receptive to progressives who pushed the Fed to be more responsive to communities of color. Upon hearing the news of her nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren called Yellen “smart, tough, and principled.”

Nevertheless, as fed chair, Yellen could have done more to advance financial regulation. She rarely spoke out on the topic until a 2017 warning against regulatory rollbacks — a warning that some speculated was the reason Trump did not renominate her. However, The Washington Post reported a simpler, more insulting reason: Trump decided not to renominate Yellen as fed chair because he thought she was too short.

As treasury secretary, Yellen will now have her work cut out for her, as both she and Biden are inheriting a messy situation made messier by Trump’s active attempts at sabotage.

The Trump administration continues to stymie President-elect Biden’s transition. It took more than two weeks before General Services Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy finally acknowledged on November 23 that Joe Biden is the winner of the election. As a result, federal funds meant to go to the transition had been held up, and Biden and Harris will only now begin to receive briefings on the status of vaccine distribution plans and other pandemic response matters.

In a statement in response to the GSA news, the Biden transition team said it would begin meetings quickly to discuss the pandemic and national security, and to “gain complete understanding of the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies.”

The long delay to the start of the formal transition is hardly the only way that the Trump administration is working furiously to sabotage the incoming administration. Trump officials are also making moves to make future diplomacy, economic recovery and climate change remediation more difficult.

Mike Pompeo spent the last week and a half creating diplomatic outrage across the world.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has not acknowledged Joe Biden’s victory, spent the last week and a half creating diplomatic outrage across the world. In Paris, Pompeo met with reporters from the right-wing French magazine Valeurs Actuelles, which was criticized for its racism after it printed an image depicting a Black French lawmaker as a slave. Then, Pompeo became the most senior U.S. official to visit an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. He traveled to a winery built on land claimed by Palestinians; the Israeli-owned winery had previously named a wine after Pompeo. Most in the international community, including the United Nations, consider these settlements illegal under the Geneva Convention. But Pompeo announced that the U.S. will allow goods produced in Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory to use a “Made in Israel” label. Pompeo also visited the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria. Syria condemned the visit, calling it “provocative” and a “flagrant violation” of Syrian sovereignty.

Stephen Miles, executive director of Win Without War, described Pompeo’s 10-day tour as a way to actively sabotage Joe Biden. Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Bloomberg that Pompeo was spending the remainder of his time in office “trolling the world.”

It’s not just diplomatic problems the outgoing Trump administration is causing; it appears to be attempting to create economic ones as well. Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would shut down most of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending programs — including the program meant to lend to municipalities — and return any unused money. Since the Fed has only used about $25 billion, that totals some $429 billion. This means the likely end to future loans the Fed could have made to municipalities and medium-sized businesses in order to help aid the economic recovery. It’s worth noting, though, that the CARES Act only demands that any unused funds be sent back to the Treasury’s general fund — to be used for deficit reduction — in 2026. This means Yellen could, in coordination with the Fed, potentially restart the programs in the next administration.

House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters said the Trump administration was trying to “spitefully destroy the economy” with the move.

It need not be this way — the Fed could refuse the Treasury’s request. But thus far, it hasn’t, instead releasing a letter that stated it would “work out arrangements” to return the unused funds. The Biden transition team called the move “deeply irresponsible.” Congressional Oversight Commission member Bharat Ramamurti called the Fed’s decision “disappointing,” and contrasted the way the Fed got “creative” during the 2008 crisis and “stretched every authority to help big banks” to “doing the bare minimum” in 2020 when Congress asked it to help small businesses, states and cities.

Indeed, that the Fed went along with the Treasury implies that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell may not disagree with the move. Powell has not been eager to heed the many calls for reform to the emergency lending programs, which are intended to be used to boost markets for corporate bonds, state, city and municipal bonds, and provide loans to medium-sized businesses. For example, House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters and Delegate Michael San Nicolas of Guam repeatedly called on the Fed to loan to U.S. territories through the program. The Fed never made it happen. Given that the Biden administration would likely ask the Fed to ensure more states and cities could participate in the program, it may have been politically convenient for the Fed to let the Treasury shut it down instead.

This is hardly the first attempt by the Trump administration at hindering economic recovery in the new year. The Trump administration has thus far refused to extend either the federal student loan suspension or the evictions moratorium, meaning that, pending further action, federal student loan borrowers will need to restart payments on January 1, and renters will be vulnerable to evictions.

From a controversial international tour by the secretary of state, to shutting down emergency lending programs at the Fed as the pandemic accelerates, Trump, with the consent of the GOP, is trying to sabotage Biden’s chances at a recovery.

Not content to stop at attempts to hamper diplomacy or the economy, the Trump administration is also trying to give oil and gas firms everything it can on the way out. Trump has gutted environmental regulations throughout his entire term and he isn’t slowing down in these last few weeks. On November 17, the administration moved another step closer to allowing oil and gas companies to drill in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, home to the Gwich’in people and the migration path of North America’s largest caribou herd, which Biden has plans to permanently protect. And this past week, the banking regulator at the Office for Comptroller of the Currency announced a proposed rule that attempts to force banks to loan to oil companies, or any other companies a bank may have deemed poses a reputation risk. The way the Office for Comptroller of the Currency proposed the rule was particularly offensive, comparing a refusal by banks to loan to weapons manufacturers to discrimination.

Georgetown law professor Adam Levitin questioned whether the Office for Comptroller of the Currency even has the authority to enact this proposal. And climate groups criticized the move as an attempt to intimidate banks into investing in financially risky projects. Gregg Gelzinis from the Center for American Progress called it an “abuse of power.” And Ben Cushing from the Sierra Club said that “no amount of saber-rattling” by the outgoing Trump administration will change the inherent riskiness of Arctic drilling projects that “any savvy financial institution would stay far away from.”

From a controversial international tour by the secretary of state, to shutting down emergency lending programs at the Fed as the pandemic accelerates, to continuing to do damage to the climate, Trump, with the consent of the GOP, is trying to sabotage Biden’s chances at a recovery every way he can. But it’s the nation itself that will suffer — and Trump and his administration don’t care. As Adam Serwer wrote in 2018 of Trump’s policies, “the cruelty is the point.” Trump is doing his best to accelerate it in his final weeks in office.

a number of policies that would raise taxes on individuals with income above $400,000, including raising individual income, capital gains, and payroll taxes. Biden would also raise taxes on corporations by raising the corporate income tax rate and imposing a corporate minimum book tax. Biden’s plan would raise tax revenue by $3.3 trillion over the next decade on a conventional basis. When accounting for macroeconomic feedback effects, the plan would collect about $2.8 trillion the next decade. This is lower than we originally estimated due to the revenue effects of the coronavirus pandemic and economic downturn and new tax credit A tax credit is a provision that reduces a taxpayer’s final tax bill, dollar-for-dollar. A tax credit differs from deductions and exemptions, which reduce taxable income, rather than the taxpayer’s tax bill directly.

According to the Tax Foundation’s General Equilibrium Model, the Biden tax plan would reduce GDP by 1.62 percent over the long term.

On a conventional basis, the Biden tax plan by 2030 would lead to about 7.7 percent less after-tax income After-tax income is the net amount of income available to invest, save, or consume after federal, state, and withholding taxes have been applied—your disposable income.

Details of Biden Tax Plan

The Biden tax plan includes the following payroll tax A payroll tax is a tax paid on the wages and salaries of employees to finance social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Payroll taxes are social insurance taxes that comprise 24.8 percent of combined federal, state, and local government revenue, the second largest source of that combined tax revenue. , individual income tax An individual income tax (or personal income tax) is levied on the wages, salaries, investments, or other forms of income an individual or household earns. The U.S. imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income. The Federal Income Tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. Though barely 100 years old, individual income taxes are the largest source of tax revenue in the U.S. , and estate and gift tax A gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property by a living individual, without payment or a valuable exchange in return. The donor, not the recipient of the gift, is typically liable for the tax. changes:

Imposes a 12.4 percent Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (Social Security) payroll tax on income earned above $400,000, evenly split between employers and employees. This would create a “donut hole” in the current Social Security payroll tax, where wages between $137,700, the current wage cap, and $400,000 are not taxed.[1]

Reverts the top individual income tax rate for taxable incomes above $400,000 from 37 percent under current law to the pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of 39.6 percent.

Taxes long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the ordinary income tax rate of 39.6 percent on income above $1 million and eliminates step-up in basis The step-up in basis provision adjusts the value, or “cost basis,” of an inherited asset (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) when it is passed on, after death. This often reduces the capital gains tax owed by the recipient. The cost basis receives a “step-up” to its fair market value, or the price at which the good would be sold or purchased in a fair market. This eliminates the capital gain that occurred between the original purchase of the asset and the heir’s acquisition, reducing the heir’s tax liability. [2]

[2] Caps the tax benefit of itemized deductions to 28 percent of value for those earning more than $400,000, which means that taxpayers earning above that income threshold with tax rates higher than 28 percent would face limited itemized deductions.

Restores the Pease limitation on itemized deductions for taxable incomes above $400,000.

Phases out the qualified business income deduction (Section 199A) for filers with taxable income Taxable income is the amount of income subject to tax, after deductions and exemptions. For both individuals and corporations, taxable income differs from—and is less than—gross income.

Expands the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) from a maximum of $3,000 in qualified expenses to $8,000 ($16,000 for multiple dependents) and increases the maximum reimbursement rate from 35 percent to 50 percent.

For 2021 and as long as economic conditions require, increases the Child Tax Credit (CTC) from a maximum value of $2,000 to $3,000 for children 17 or younger, while providing a $600 bonus credit for children under 6. The CTC would also be made fully refundable, removing the $2,500 reimbursement threshold and 15 percent phase-in rate.[3]

Reestablishes the First-Time Homebuyers’ Tax Credit, which was originally created during the Great Recession A recession is a significant and sustained decline in the economy. Typically, a recession lasts longer than six months, but recovery from a recession can take a few years. [4]

[4] Expands the estate and gift tax by restoring the rate and exemption to 2009 levels.

The Biden tax plan also includes the following proposed business tax changes:

Increases the corporate income tax A corporate income tax (CIT) is levied by federal and state governments on business profits. Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as pass-through businesses, with income reportable under the individual income tax. [5]

[5] Creates a minimum tax on corporations with book profits of $100 million or higher. The minimum tax is structured as an alternative minimum tax—corporations will pay the greater of their regular corporate income tax or the 15 percent minimum tax while still allowing for net operating loss (NOL) and foreign tax credits.[6]

Doubles the tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) earned by foreign subsidiaries of US firms from 10.5 percent to 21 percent.

In addition to doubling the tax rate assessed on GILTI, Biden proposes to assess GILTI on a country-by-country basis and eliminate GILTI’s exemption for deemed returns under 10 percent of qualified business asset investment (QBAI).[7]

Establishes a Manufacturing Communities Tax Credit to reduce the tax liability of businesses that experience workforce layoffs or a major government institution closure

Expands the New Markets Tax Credit and makes it permanent.

Offers tax credits to small business for adopting workplace retirement savings plans.

Expands several renewable-energy-related tax credits, including tax credits for carbon capture, use, and storage as well as credits for residential energy efficiency, and a restoration of the Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Electric Vehicle Tax Credit. The Biden plan would also end tax subsidies for fossil fuels.

Other proposals not modeled due to a lack of detailed information include:

Imposing a new 10 percent surtax A surtax is an additional tax levied on top of an already existing business or individual tax and can have a flat or progressive rate structure. Surtaxes are typically enacted to fund a specific program or initiative, whereas revenue from broader-based taxes, like the individual income tax, typically cover a multitude of programs and services. [8] This surtax would raise the effective corporate tax rate on this activity up to 30.8 percent.

Equalizing the tax benefits of traditional retirement accounts (such as 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts) by providing a refundable tax credit A refundable tax credit can be used to generate a federal tax refund larger than the amount of tax paid throughout the year. In other words, a refundable tax credit creates the possibility of a negative federal tax liability. An example of a refundable tax credit is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). [10]

Since our September analysis of the Biden plan, we have included the Biden campaign proposal to expand the estate and gift tax by reducing the exemption amount to $3.5 million and increasing the top rate for the estate tax An estate tax is imposed on the net value of an individual’s taxable estate, after any exclusions or credits, at the time of death. The tax is paid by the estate itself before assets are distributed to heirs. to 45 percent,[11] which has impacted our economic, revenue, and distributional estimates.

We have also added a discussion of the effects of Biden’s plan on Gross National Product (GNP), which allows us to examine how it would reduce American incomes.

Updates from our April 2020 Analysis

Since we released our first analysis of Biden’s tax proposals, the campaign has proposed several new tax policies that have impacted our revenue and distributional estimates.

That includes proposals to expand several credits, including the CTC and the CDCTC. The proposed expansion to the CTC would be a major increase in the generosity of the credit by increasing the maximum credit amount up to $3,600 for children under 6 and by making the credit fully refundable without regard to a taxpayer’s income level. The CDCTC would be expanded to a maximum value of $8,000, with a higher maximum refundable percentage of 50 percent.

The Biden campaign has proposed that the CTC expansion remain for 2021 and “as long as economic conditions require,” based on an original proposal in the House-passed HEROES Act.[12] For this proposal, we assume that the expansion lasts for one year, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) for the HEROES Act proposal.[13]

In addition to proposed changes to the CTC and CDCTC, Biden has released a proposed plan to reduce offshoring of production and jobs from the United States by modifying the way GILTI is taxed and through other tax incentives. In addition to doubling the GILTI rate to 21 percent, Biden would eliminate the 10 percent deemed return exemption based on qualified business asset investment (QBAI) and would assess the tax on a country-by-country basis.

Biden has also newly proposed a 10 percent surtax on imports from offshored business activity and a 10 percent “Made in America” tax credit to incentivize onshoring; we have not included these two proposals in our estimates due to a lack of detail on their design.

We have also refined our estimate for the Biden minimum book tax on corporations to project the revenue effects of the tax more accurately. In this update, we have included an estimate of Biden’s First-Time Homebuyer’s Tax Credit worth up to $15,000. Additionally, we have included stacked long-term economic effects for each proposal to provide more granularity on each proposal’s economic impact.

Since our original analysis, the Biden campaign has clarified that it will hold harmless taxpayers making under $400,000 from tax increases associated with the proposed 28 percent cap on itemized deductions. We have modified our modeling of this proposal so that filers with less than $400,000 can take the full value of their itemized deductions but those above that threshold have the value of itemized deductions capped at 28 percent.[14]

Finally, the coronavirus pandemic and related economic downturn have impacted the federal government’s budget outlook over the next 10 years, including federal revenue projections. The large economic shock will also affect how much revenue the Biden tax plan would be expected to raise due to a lower baseline level of economic activity, especially in the first few years in the budget window. To account for this effect, we have used the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) September 2020 update to the budget outlook to adjust our revenue estimates for each proposal.[15]

Economic Effect

According to the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, Biden’s tax plan would reduce the economy’s size by 1.62 percent in the long run. The plan would shrink the capital stock by about 3.75 percent and reduce the overall wage rate by a little over 1 percent, leading to about 542,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs.

The economic effect of Biden’s tax proposals can be separated to show the specific impact of each proposal on long-run economic output (see Table 2).

Table 2. Economic Effect of Biden’s Tax Plan by Provision Provision Long-Run Change in Economic Output Apply a Social Security payroll tax of 12.4% to earnings above $400,000 -0.18% Tax capital gains and dividends at 39.6% on income above $1 million and repeal step-up in basis -0.02% Restore estate and gift taxes to 2009 levels -0.15% Limit the tax benefit of itemized deductions at 28% of value for those earning over $400,000 -0.09% Raise the corporate income tax to 28% -0.97% 15% corporate minimum book tax -0.21% Total -1.62% Source: Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, October 2020.

The increase in the corporate income tax from 21 percent to 28 percent and the 15 percent minimum book tax on corporations make up a majority of the economic impact of Biden’s tax proposals. Applying the Social Security payroll tax on earnings over $400,000 also reduces long-run output by about 0.18 percent. Taxing capital gains as ordinary income for those earning over $1 million, repealing step-up in basis, and limiting itemized deductions to 28 percent of value for higher earners also contribute to lower economic output for a combined reduction of 0.11 percent. Biden’s plan to increase the estate and gift tax would reduce long-run output by 0.15 percent.

Biden’s proposed increase to the top individual income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent does not reduce long-run growth, as the top individual income tax rate is already scheduled to increase under current law in 2026. This is because of the temporary nature of the tax reduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) from 2018 to 2025.[16] Similarly, the phaseout of the Section 199A pass-through reduction for those earning over $400,000 does not reduce long-run growth because it is scheduled to expire in 2026.

Effect of Biden’s Tax Plan on Gross National Product

Several of Biden’s tax proposals, such as imposing ordinary income tax rates on capital gains and dividends for those earning over $1 million and raising estate and gift taxes, would reduce both American economic output (GDP) and the incomes received by Americans. By estimating the plan’s effect on Gross National Production (GNP), we can examine how the plan would reduce American incomes.

Taxes levied on domestic saving may reduce the ownership of American investment by domestic residents. However, the U.S. economy is open to international investment, which means that domestic investment opportunities may instead be financed by foreign investors not subject to the increased tax burden. While increased international investment helps reduce the effect of the tax change on domestic output, it would also change the composition of that output’s ownership. In the case of international investment, returns to those investments would instead flow to foreign owners, rather than to Americans.

The result of this capital flow is a wedge between GDP (economic output) and GNP (American incomes). Biden’s tax plan would produce this wedge by raising taxes on domestic savers, resulting in lower American incomes and greater foreign ownership of domestic assets. This would also manifest in a shifted balance of trade, increasing the trade deficit, all else held equal.[17]

The Tax Foundation’s General Equilibrium Model assumes that C corporations and the U.S. government can receive financing from abroad without changing interest rates, while the pass-through sector may not be able to fully use foreign capital inflows when tax rates change. This means the service price of capital may increase for the pass-through sector, producing lower investment and long-run economic output.[18] In combination, this means the Biden taxes on U.S. savers reduces economic output for pass-through firms and shifts the ownership of C corporations away from domestic residents due to increased foreign financial inflows. All else being equal, this reduces long-run American incomes, and the increased foreign financial inflows drives up the value of the dollar, which increases the trade deficit, all else held equal.

According to the Tax Foundation’s General Equilibrium Model, the Biden tax plan would reduce long-run GNP by about 1.83%.[19] The difference between the plan’s effect on GNP and GDP results from the flow of foreign investment into the U.S. that keeps U.S. economic output higher than GNP after taxes change.

Table 3. Effect of Biden’s Tax Plan on Gross National Product Gross Domestic Product (GDP) -1.62% Gross National Product (GNP) -1.83% Source: Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, October 2020.

In addition to reduced economic output and lower GNP, the shift in financial flows internationally may also produce transitional effects. While these effects may be smaller than those produced by larger taxes on savers proposed by others (such as a wealth tax A wealth tax is imposed on an individual’s net wealth, or the market value of their total owned assets minus liabilities. A wealth tax can be narrowly or widely defined, and depending on the definition of wealth, the base for a wealth tax can vary. ), there would still be impacts on exchange rates as capital flows readjust.[20]

If international capital flows are restricted in the future, the Biden plan’s taxes on savers would result in an even greater loss in economic output and less investment in the American economy than these estimates show, resulting in lower wages and worker productivity.

Revenue Effect

Based on the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, we estimate that, on a conventional basis, Biden’s plan would increase federal tax revenue by $3.33 trillion between 2021 and 2030 relative to current law. Increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent would account for the largest revenue gain (about $1 trillion over 10 years) in the plan. Adding other changes on the business side, such as the 15 percent corporate minimum tax and tax increases on international profits, Biden’s taxes on businesses account for about 46 percent of the revenue gains.

Higher taxes levied on taxpayers earning more than $400,000, including higher tax rates on ordinary income as well as capital gains and dividends, would raise another $1 trillion over 10 years. The payroll tax increase for high-income households would generate around $820 billion in additional revenue over 10 years.

Table 4 presents the conventional revenue score for each individual provision of the plan. We estimate the integrated revenue effects by stacking one provision after the other. The presented revenue effect for each provision is the difference between the newly stacked simulation and the simulation that includes all provisions listed above it. Note that some of Biden’s proposals, such as the higher marginal income tax rate on income above $400,000, raise revenue in the beginning of the 10-year window, but not at the end. This is because under current law, the lower 37 percent rate is already scheduled to revert to 39.6 beginning in 2026, meaning Biden’s proposal does not result in increased revenue in those years.

Our original analysis projected that the Biden tax plan would raise about $3.8 trillion conventionally over 10 years. The reduction in estimated revenue is due to two factors. First, the economic downturn driven by the coronavirus pandemic reduced expected revenue over the budget window, including revenue expected from tax increases. Second, the Biden campaign included new tax credit proposals, including a $105.5 billion expansion in the CTC, that reduced net revenue collections over the budget window.

On a dynamic basis, we estimate that Biden’s tax plan would raise about $553 billion less revenue than on a conventional basis over the next decade. Dynamic revenue gains would total approximately $2.78 trillion between 2021 and 2030. That is because the relatively smaller economy would shrink the tax base The tax base is the total amount of income, property, assets, consumption, transactions, or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is non-neutral and inefficient. A broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates. for payroll, individual income, and business income taxes.

Items may not sum due to rounding.

Distributional Effect

On a conventional basis, Biden’s tax plan would make the tax code more progressive. The proposed changes to individual income taxes affect the distribution of the tax burden differently after 2025, as the individual income tax provisions in the TCJA expire and Biden’s CTC proposal is no longer in effect. To show this difference, we present the distributional effect for both 2021 and 2030.

In 2021, on a conventional basis, taxpayers in the top 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes reduced by around 11.3 percent due to higher taxes on income above $400,000. The top 5 percent would see a reduction in after-tax incomes of about 1.3 percent. Filers in the 90th to 95th percentiles would see a slight reduction in after-tax incomes of about 0.2 percent.

Taxpayers in lower income quintiles would see an increase in their after-tax income in 2021. This increase is driven by the large expansion of the CTC in 2021, which boosts the bottom 20 percent’s after-tax incomes the most due to the CTC’s increased refundability and size. Taxpayers higher up the income distribution would see smaller increases in after-tax incomes, facing the indirect effects of higher business taxes while receiving a CTC benefit that is a lower share of their after-tax incomes compared to the bottom 20 percent.

The conventional distribution table for 2030 contrasts with the conventional distribution in 2021. This is because the proposed CTC expansion would have ended, and households across the income spectrum would experience lower after-tax incomes. The bottom 20 percent of filers, for example, would experience a 0.2 percent decrease in their after-tax incomes in 2030.

Households across the income spectrum in 2030 would face an increased tax burden on labor from higher corporate income taxes. The Tax Foundation’s General Equilibrium Model assumes that the corporate tax is borne by both capital and labor and evenly split between the two in the long run. However, the labor share of the corporate income tax change is gradually phased in over five years.[21]

Another notable difference is that the change in after-tax income for the top 1 percent would be smaller in 2030 than in 2021. This is because several individual income tax provisions, such as the 37 percent top marginal income tax rate, expire starting in 2026. Accordingly, some of Biden’s tax increases on high-income households would not increase their tax burden in 2030 compared to current law in that year. Biden’s plan would reduce after-tax incomes for the top 1 percent by about 7.7 percent in 2030, compared to 11.3 percent in 2021. On average, after-tax income for all taxpayers would shrink by 1.9 percent, lower than the 1.2 percent decline in 2021.

On a dynamic basis, the Tax Foundation’s General Equilibrium Model estimates that the plan would reduce after-tax incomes by about 2.8 percent across all income groups over the long run. The lower four income quintiles would see a decrease in after-tax incomes of at least 1.2 percent. Taxpayers in between the 95th and 99th percentiles would see their after-tax income drop by 2.1 percent, while taxpayers in the 99th percentile and up would have a more significant reduction in their after-tax income of about 8.9 percent.

Conclusion

President Joe Biden, according to the tax plan he released before the election, would raise taxes on the labor income, investment income, and business income of those earning over $400,000. Among other changes, the plan imposes a “donut hole” payroll tax on earnings over $400,000, repeals the TCJA’s income tax cuts for taxpayers with taxable income above $400,000, and increases the corporate income tax rate to 28 percent.

Additionally, Biden has proposed a variety of new tax credits or expansions to existing credits to help increase after-tax incomes for low-earners. Biden’s onshoring plan increases the taxation of foreign profits while providing credits to incentivize economic activity that is onshored. Biden’s plan would shrink the long-run size of the economy by 1.62 percent due to higher marginal tax rate The marginal tax rate is the amount of additional tax paid for every additional dollar earned as income. The average tax rate is the total tax paid divided by total income earned. A 10 percent marginal tax rate means that 10 cents of every next dollar earned would be taken as tax. s on labor and capital.

Biden’s tax plan would raise about $3.33 trillion over the next decade on a conventional basis, and $2.78 trillion after accounting for the reduction in the size of the U.S. economy. While taxpayers in the bottom four quintiles would see an increase in after-tax incomes in 2021 primarily due to the temporary CTC expansion, by 2030 the plan would lead to lower after-tax income for all income levels.

Modeling Notes

We use the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Tax Model to estimate the impact of tax policies.[22] The model can produce both conventional and dynamic revenue estimates of tax policy. Conventional estimates hold the size of the economy constant and attempt to estimate potential behavioral effects of tax policy. Dynamic revenue estimates consider both behavioral and macroeconomic effects of tax policy on revenue.

The model can also produce estimates of how policies impact measures of economic performance such as GDP, wages, employment, the capital stock, investment, consumption, saving, and the trade deficit. Lastly, it can produce estimates of how different tax policy impacts the distribution of the federal tax burden.

In our revenue estimate, we assume the long-run capital gains realization elasticity is -0.79.[23] Individuals respond more drastically to the change of capital gains tax A capital gains tax is levied on the profit made from selling an asset and is often in addition to corporate income taxes, frequently resulting in double taxation. These taxes create a bias against saving, leading to a lower level of national income by encouraging present consumption over investment. rate at the beginning years of tax change, with a transitory elasticity of -1.2 and -1.0 for the first two years.

In modeling the repeal of step-up in basis on capital gains tax, we assume Biden’s plan would lead to taxing capital gains at death, which means that death would be treated as a realized event for capital gains.

Updated at 5:30 p.m. ET

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on Tuesday detailed a proposal to advance racial equity in the United States.

The plan is the fourth and final pillar of his ""Build Back Better"" agenda for economic recovery, crafted in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

""[Biden] believes in an economy where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy more vibrant and more powerful precisely because everybody will be included in the deal. An economy where Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native American workers and families are finally welcomed as full participants,"" the campaign proposal says.

Biden outlined the plan Tuesday afternoon during remarks in his hometown of Wilmington, Del. Biden has significantly curtailed his campaign travel amid the pandemic, mostly staying in Delaware and next-door Pennsylvania.

The former vice president took questions from reporters following his remarks. He said he plans to name his vice presidential pick next week, and he expressed confidence in Democrats retaking the Senate.

Biden's new proposal seeks to address the country's racial wealth, opportunity and jobs gaps through what the campaign says would be a ""historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas — and particularly for Black, Latino, [Asian American and Pacific Islander] and Native American-owned businesses.""

The 26-page plan centers around the bolstering of small business opportunities for minority communities, reforming ""opportunity zones,"" investing in affordable housing and homeownership, and expanding access to resources for entrepreneurs of color.

Many of the policy proposals detailed Tuesday have been released earlier by the campaign and reflect the priorities of the other three pillars of his plan to revitalize the economy, including a major expansion of access to child care, a $2 trillion climate agenda and a boost to manufacturing through a ""Buy American"" proposal.

The racial equity plan would devote $30 billion — 10% of the $300 billion Biden aims to invest in research and development to stimulate the economy — to a new small business opportunity fund. The campaign suggests the investment would yield $150 billion in venture capital and low-interest business loans.

The housing plan includes an up-to-$15,000 refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers to combat racial inequality in housing markets, along with an investment to construct 1.5 million homes and public housing units, and the elimination of housing regulations thought to perpetuate discrimination.

The plan also focuses on providing relief from student debt and would make public colleges and universities — and private historically Black schools — tuition-free for families with incomes under $125,000, something the campaign estimates would apply to about 90% of Black, Latino and Native American households.

Additionally, the plan reads: ""As President, Biden will enact legislation to ensure that every person can go to community college for up to two years without having to pay tuition.""

Biden also called on the Federal Reserve to add targeting persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages and wealth to its core mandate.

In response to the plan, President Trump's reelection campaign said in a statement that ""no one should listen to a lecture on racial justice from Joe Biden,"" citing his past relationships with segregationist senators and various comments he's made.

Last week, during a virtual town hall organized by the Service Employees International Union, Biden controversially described Trump as the country's ""first"" racist president, which was first reported by the The Washington Post.

""No sitting president has ever done this,"" he said, mentioning that Trump often refers to the coronavirus as the ""China virus."" Biden said: ""We've had racists, and they've existed. They've tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has.""

Various American Founding Fathers, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, enslaved Black people. Still more presidents held racist beliefs, including President Woodrow Wilson, who segregated the federal government. The Biden campaign later clarified to the Post that while there have been other racist presidents, Trump ""stands out — especially in modern history — because he made running on racism and division his calling card and won.""

Trump dismissed Biden's comments during a White House press briefing, citing his administration's efforts at passing criminal justice reform and the low unemployment rate for Black people before the pandemic.

""I've done more for Black Americans than anybody with the possible of exception of Abraham Lincoln,"" he said."

Vice President Mike Pence and others twisted facts on the economy, some of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s positions and more at the Republican National Convention’s third night Wednesday.

And there were several repeat claims on fracking, abortion, school choice, military pay and immigration.

Here is the analysis:

Pence’s economic distortion

Pence repeated a central theme of the Trump campaign when he said Biden “presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression” and that Trump “created the greatest economy in the world.”

It’s true that the economic recovery from 2009 to 2016 was the slowest since World War II, and probably since the 1930s Depression as well. That’s not surprising considering that the country was recovering from the most severe economic downturn since the Depression itself.

But claiming that Trump “created” the “greatest economy” is a grandiose distortion.

Pence ignores the fact that the economy had been growing without interruption for seven years before Trump took office. As we noted when he was inaugurated, unemployment was already well below the historical norm, and the economy had already racked up the longest uninterrupted stretch of monthly job gains on record. Stock prices had doubled and tripled; the S&P 500 index had gained 166 percent even before Trump’s surprise election victory on Nov. 8, 2016.

Trump didn’t “create” any of that; it was given to him.

Job growth has continued under Trump, but at a slower pace. The economy added nearly 2.5 million jobs in the 12 months before Trump took office, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. It added just over 2 million during Trump’s first year. The unemployment rate continued to drop, from 4.7 percent when Trump took office to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent under Trump, before the COVID-19 pandemic sent it shooting up to the worst levels since the 1930s. It hit 14.7 petcent in April and stood at 10.2 percent last month — still worse than any month of the Obama-Biden administration.

Biden and crime

Pence said baselessly that Americans would not be safe if Biden were elected president. In doing so, he suggested that Biden would “defund the police,” something Biden has said he does not support.

And the vice president misleadingly used a response by Biden to a question in claiming the Democratic presidential nominee supported “cutting funding to law enforcement.”

When asked whether he’d support cutting funding to law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, ‘Yes, absolutely.’ Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America’s cities. The hard truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America. Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we’re not going to defund the police — not now, not ever. Vice President Mike Pence, Aug. 26

There is no evidence that Americans would be less safe in Joe Biden’s America. As FactCheck.org has written, Trump and his campaign have repeatedly and falsely claimed that a Biden administration would eviscerate law enforcement, with Americans subjected to mayhem in the streets and unanswered police calls. But Biden has said on a number of occasions that he is opposed to defunding the police, and a Biden spokesman told us the Democratic nominee supports more funding for police for some functions, such as initiatives to strengthen community relationships and for body-worn cameras.

The federal government pays a small percentage of law enforcement expenses. According to a backgrounder by the Urban Institute, 86 percent of police funding in 2017 was from local governments, with additional money ponied up by state governments.

Here is the context for the “Yes, absolutely” response cited by Pence.

In a July 8 interview with progressive activist Ady Barkan about police reforms, Biden was asked about shifting some funding from police to social service agencies for tasks that could be better handled by the latter. “Yes, absolutely,” Biden responded. But as we said, he would support additional funding in some categories.

In a segment of the interview that didn’t appear on YouTube, Biden said he supports reforms, but “that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police.” (The Washington Post Fact Checker obtained audio of the full conversation.)

While Pence draws a contrast between the two candidates, it’s worth noting both Biden and Trump have expressed support for the idea of social workers and mental health personnel joining forces with police in some cases, as FactCheck.org has explained.

Pence misleads on officer death

Pence was the fourth speaker of the night to characterize protests that swelled across the country this summer as violent.

Those protests called for an end to racism and police brutality after George Floyd, a black man, died when a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25.

While some of the protests have led to rioting and looting, the majority have been peaceful. A New York Times analysis of four polls conducted in June found that between 15 million and 26 million people participated in demonstrations, and the Associated Press counted the number of arrests through June 4 at about 10,000, many of which were for violating curfew or failing to disperse.

“Let me be clear: the violence must stop — whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha,” Pence said, highlighting three cities that have seen unrest recently reignited by the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23.

Pence then praised law enforcement officers and mentioned one name in particular.

“President Trump and I know that the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. Every day, when they walk out that door, they consider our lives more important than their own,” he said. “People like Dave Patrick Underwood, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security’s federal protective service who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California.”

Although Pence didn’t explicitly say who shot Underwood, the context of his remarks suggests that it was someone protesting police violence in the wake of Floyd’s death. But that would be wrong.

Federal prosecutors have charged Steven Carrillo, a right-wing extremist, in Underwood’s May 29 killing.

Carrillo favored the far-right movement called boogaloo, which stokes fear about impending civil war, according to the criminal complaint against him. He used the crowds gathered to protest Floyd’s death as cover to “kill cops,” according to John Bennett, special agent in charge of the San Francisco division of the FBI.

Carrillo is also charged with the murder of a sergeant in the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office, Damon Gutzwiller. That killing came a week after Underwood’s death. The case is in state court.

Black employment spin

Clarence Henderson, who participated in the famous 1960 sit-in at the Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, praised Trump for the “record number of jobs he created for the Black community.”

It’s true that the number of African Americans employed hit a record under Trump. But it wasn’t all his doing. In fact, jobs for Blacks grew faster under Obama-Biden — and all of Trump’s gains and more have disappeared.

Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ household survey, which tracks employment by race and ethnicity, show Black employment hit a peak of over 19.7 million in February (before plunging to a six-year low of 16.2 million in April due to the pandemic).

But even in Trump’s good times, Black employment grew less than under Obama-Biden. During their final three years in office, nearly 2.1 million Black people gained employment. During the next three years, under Trump, the number grew by just over 1.1 million.

All the gains of Trump’s first years were wiped out by the pandemic. As of July, nearly 1.3 million Black Americans had lost employment since he took office.

Health insurance for women

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump is the “champion” of “everyday heroes” such as “the single mom with two kids, two jobs, two commutes, who 10 years after that empty promise finally has health insurance.”

But millions of women remain uninsured, and, as of 2018, the number of women age 19 to 64 without health insurance had actually increased under Trump, according to the most recent data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

In 2010, when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, 18.1 million, or 19 percent of, women between 19 and 64 years of age did not have health insurance. In 2016, Obama’s final year in office, the number and percentage of uninsured women in that age group had declined to 10.3 million, or 11 percent.

“The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded access to affordable coverage through a combination of Medicaid expansions, private insurance reforms, and premium tax credits,” KFF said in its January 2020 report.

But under Trump, the number of women between 19 and 64 without health coverage increased to 10.8 million in 2018 — and the percentage remained flat at 11 percent.

As KFF said in its analysis: “The significant drop in the share of uninsured women has stalled in recent years. Recent state and federal efforts to roll back ACA-related policies could further weaken coverage and may result in higher out-of-pocket costs for women who need these services.”

The health policy nonprofit also noted that “a lawsuit working its way through the courts,” which the Trump administration supports, “could result in the entire ACA being invalidated.” That would increase the number of uninsured women further.

Biden on terrorist killings

Pence twisted the facts when he said Biden “criticized President Trump following those … decisions to rid the world of two terrorist leaders,” Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and that Biden “even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden.”

Biden did not oppose Trump’s decision to undertake a raid to kill al-Baghdadi, though Biden did criticize Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, which Biden argued made the raid to kill al-Baghdadi more dangerous.

“I’m glad President Trump ordered the mission,” Biden said in a statement. “But as more details of the raid emerge, it’s clear that this victory was not due to Donald Trump’s leadership. It happened despite his ineptitude as commander-in-chief.”

Biden did criticize Trump after his decision to kill Soleimani. Biden said that while “[n]o American will mourn Qassem Soleimani’s passing” and “he deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region,” Trump’s decision to target Soleimani in a drone attack was “a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region” that was likely to prompt an Iranian attack. Trump “just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox,” Biden said.

As for Pence’s claim that Biden “even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden,” that’s misleading. Biden said he opposed the timing of the operation, and suggested that the raid should be delayed in order to take further steps to confirm bin Laden was at the compound in Pakistan.

Back in January, we took a look into various — and sometimes conflicting — accounts that Biden has provided about his advice to Obama about whether to move forward with the raid to kill bin Laden.

Several weeks after the raid, at a time when Obama was gearing up for a reelection campaign, the New York Times on May 26, 2011, reported that Biden said at a Democratic fundraiser in late May 2011 “that he and others had counseled Mr. Obama to be more careful and cautious about the raid. But he said it was the president who made the decision to launch the daring action.”

“I said ‘wait another seven days for information,’” Biden reportedly said.

At House Democrats’ annual retreat in January 2012, Biden said that at the April 2011 national security team meeting, he told Obama “my suggestion is, don’t go. We have to do two more things to see if he’s there.”

In May 2012, during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Biden added a new twist to his account, saying that after the team meeting, he privately told Obama, “’Follow your instincts, Mr. President. Your instincts have been close to unerring. Follow your instincts.’ I wanted him to take one more day to do one more test to see if he was there.” Three years later, in 2015, Biden said he privately told Obama, “that I thought he should go, but follow his own instincts.”

As we noted in January, we can’t confirm what Biden may have told Obama privately. But even given what Biden said he told Obama in front of others at the security team meeting — that Obama should wait (a version that was corroborated by others at the meeting) — waiting is not the same as opposing the operation outright.

Biden condemned violence

Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee falsely claimed that “Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their radical allies … encourage protests, riots and looting in the streets.” Biden has repeatedly condemned violent protests, riots and looting.

In a video posted to Twitter about six hours before Blackburn’s speech aired, Biden said he spoke to the family of Jacob Blake, who was shot by police in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23. The shooting sparked chaotic and at times violent protests.

“You know, as I said after George Floyd’s murder, protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary,” Biden said. “But burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence, violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses and shutters businesses that serve the community. That’s wrong.

“In the midst of this pain, the wisest words that I’ve heard spoken so far have come from Julia Jackson, Jacob’s mother,” Biden said. “She looked at the damage done in her community, and she said this, quote, ‘This doesn’t reflect my son or my family.’ So let’s unite and heal, do justice, end the violence, and end systemic racism in this country now.”

As Biden said, after the police killing of George Floyd on May 25 and the ensuing protests in cities around the country — some of which turned violent or involved looting — Biden did condemn violent protests.

“I say they have a right to be in fact angry and frustrated,” Biden said in an interview on CNN on May 29. “And more violence, hurting more people, isn’t going to answer the question. But they’re totally correct, it is time it stops.”

Biden also released a statement, widely reported in the media, in which he said, “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.”

In remarks on racial economic equity on July 28, Biden reiterated that message.

“I’ve said from the outset of the recent protests that there is no place for violence or the destruction of property,” Biden said. “Peaceful protesters should be protected — but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted — and local law enforcement can do that.”

While Biden has certainly made comments in support of peaceful protests — just as Pence did at the Republican convention — FactCheck.org could find no instances of Biden or Harris encouraging “riots and looting in the streets.” To the contrary, Biden has repeatedly condemned those things.

Later in the night after Blackburn’s remarks, Pence said, “Last week, Joe Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country.” During his speech at the Democratic convention on Aug. 20, Biden called “George Floyd’s murder” a “breaking point,” that might spur Americans to undertake ”the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.” It’s true that in that speech, Biden did not mention the violent clashes that have erupted at some of this summer’s protests. But Biden has repeatedly condemned violence that has sometimes accompanied those protests.

Russia investigation

Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence, claimed the “Obama-Biden administration secretly launched a surveillance operation on the Trump campaign” without reason. “I saw the Democrats’ entire case for Russian collusion, and what I saw made me sick to my stomach,” he said.

But multiple independent reports — most recently a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report — found that there were grounds to investigate whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

The Senate report, which was released Aug. 18, detailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s connections to Russia and Ukraine, and found he posed “a grave counterintelligence threat.”

“The Committee found that Manafort’s presence on the Campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the Trump Campaign,” the report said. “Taken as a whole, Manafort’s high-level access and willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the Russian intelligence services … represented a grave counterintelligence threat.”

Although what the committee found was “very troubling,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican committee member, said it “found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election.”

Similarly, a redacted report written by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s office found that there were “multiple contacts … between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.” But that investigation also “did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.”

The Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General in December released a report on the FBI’s handling of the so-called Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The report said that the FBI conducted an “initial analysis of links between Trump campaign members and Russia,” and then opened individual investigations in August 2016 on Manafort and three other Trump campaign associates: George Papadopoulos, Carter Page and Michael Flynn.

The IG report found the interactions between the Trump campaign aides and the FBI’s confidential sources “received the necessary FBI approvals” and were “consensually monitored and recorded by the FBI.” In short, there was no illegal spying on the Trump campaign.

“We found no evidence that the FBI used CHSs [confidential human sources] or UCEs [undercover employees] to interact with members of the Trump campaign prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,” the report said. “After the opening of the investigation, we found no evidence that the FBI placed any CHSs or UCEs within the Trump campaign or tasked any CHSs or UCEs to report on the Trump campaign.”

In the case of Page, a former campaign foreign policy adviser, the FBI used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to obtain four court-approved warrants to surveil Page, beginning in October 2016. The IG’s reported cited at least 17 “significant inaccuracies and omissions” in court applications for Page’s warrant – which Trump has cited in the past as evidence of political bias. But the IG report said it was unable to document “political bias or improper motivation” in the mishandling of Page’s FISA applications.

So, while Trump has repeatedly called the Russia investigation a “hoax” and Grenell said the investigation made him “sick,” independent reports found there were adequate grounds for the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation.

Impeachment not ‘illegal’

Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, criticized the House impeachment of Trump last year as “baseless and illegal.” It’s her opinion that it was “baseless,” but it wasn’t illegal. Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach the president and the Senate the power to remove the president upon conviction of the impeachment charges.

The House brought two articles of impeachment against Trump after a House investigation determined that the president asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and threatened to withhold military assistance to Ukraine until Zelenskiy publicly announced an investigation. On Dec. 18, 2019, the House voted 230-197 on the first article of impeachment (“abuse of power”) and 229-198 on the second article (“obstruction of Congress”). The Senate voted to acquit on both charges.

During the impeachment process, Trump argued that the impeachment was illegal and unconstitutional. On the eve of a House vote on the articles of impeachment, Trump sent a six-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, describing the impeachment as “an illegal, partisan attempted coup.” He said it “represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power,” because the charges against him “include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever.”

The president frequently questioned how he could be impeached. “How do you impeach? You had no crime,” Trump said in remarks shortly after he was impeached.

But, as FactCheck.org wrote at the time, constitutional scholars have said that a crime is not necessarily required for impeachment.

During a Dec. 4 House hearing on the constitutional framework for impeachment, constitutional scholars invited by the Democrats and Republicans were asked “does a high crime and misdemeanor require an actual statutory crime?” Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and Democratic witness, and Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor and Republican witness, agreed that no statutory crime is required.

“Everything we know about the history of impeachment reinforces the conclusion that impeachable offenses do not have to be crimes, and again, not all crimes are impeachable offenses,” Gerhardt said. “We look at, again, at the context and gravity of the misconduct.”

China travel restrictions

Pence made misleading, false and dubious claims regarding the U.S. travel restrictions on China. “Before the first case of the coronavirus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action, and suspended all travel from China, the second-largest economy in the world,” he said.

Trump didn’t suspend “all travel from China.” The administration’s travel limitations, which took effect on Feb. 2, didn’t apply to U.S. citizens, permanent residents or the immediate family members of both. Others who had traveled to mainland China within the prior two weeks were prohibited from entering the U.S.

The Associated Press found, based on Commerce Department records and private aviation information, exemptions for Hong Kong and Macau resulted in nearly 8,000 residents of those territories entering the U.S. in the three months after the travel restrictions were enacted. A New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the U.S. in the first two months after the restrictions took effect.

As for the timing of the restrictions, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection confirmed the first U.S. case on Jan. 20 in a man who had taken a trip to Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus pandemic began. There were seven confirmed cases as of Jan. 31, when the Trump administration announced the travel restrictions, and there were eight cases two days later, when the restrictions took effect, according to the CDC.

But notice Pence’s wording — “the first case of coronavirus spread.” The CDC didn’t announce what it believed to be the first case of “community spread” of the virus in the U.S. — meaning it’s not known how the person became infected — until Feb. 26. That was the 15th confirmed case in the country.

Pence continued: “Now that action saved untold American lives. And I can tell you firsthand, it bought us invaluable time to launch the greatest national mobilization since World War II.”

As FactCheck.org has written, it’s possible the restrictions on travel from China could have had some impact in slowing the importation of cases to the U.S. But we don’t have evidence of that, or of what that impact is. Pence was vague on how many lives the action might have saved, unlike the president who has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that the restrictions saved “hundreds of thousands” of lives.

The body of research on travel restrictions shows they can, if they’re very strict, delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them. Such a delay can buy public health officials time to prepare for an epidemic, but experts have faulted Trump for failing to use any delay effectively. In fact, as FactCheck.org has written, between Jan. 22 and March 10, Trump frequently minimized the impact of the coronavirus.

The vice president also claimed that Biden “actually criticized President Trump” for the travel restrictions on China.

Biden’s campaign on April 3 said he supported the administration’s travel restrictions on China. It argued that Biden’s earlier comments about Trump’s “record of hysteria and xenophobia” weren’t a reference to the restrictions, though they were made the same day those travel prohibitions were announced, as FactCheck.org has explained.

Military pay

Stefanik also talked about Trump’s support of the U.S. military, saying he signed “the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade.” It’s true that basic military pay in January increased by 3.1 percent — the largest increase since 2010, according to the Defense Department.

But, as FactCheck.org has written several times, Trump was following federal law, which sets pay raises by a statutory formula. “Under current law, the pay raise for service members is, by default, set to equal the percentage change in” the employment cost index for private-sector workers’ wages and salaries, as the Congressional Budget Office explained in a 2018 report.

Fracking and fossil fuels

Pence falsely claimed that Biden would “abolish fossil fuels” and “end fracking.” But Biden’s climate platform doesn’t go that far.

As FactCheck.org explained on the first night of the convention when similar claims were made, Biden wants to prohibit new oil and gas leases on public lands and waters. That would allow existing permits to continue and wouldn’t affect activity on private land.

Longer-term, Biden is aiming to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050, which would almost certainly require a large reduction in the use of fossil fuels. But that’s decades into the future and it’s not a ban, since carbon capture and other technologies could be paired with those energy sources to meet the net-zero goal.

Abortion

Throughout the night, multiple speakers exaggerated Biden’s position on abortion. Pence said, “Joe Biden, he supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth.” Sister Deirdre “Dede” Byrne, of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, similarly said that Biden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, “are the most anti-life presidential ticket ever, even supporting the horrors of late-term abortion and infanticide.”

As FactCheck.org wrote on the first convention night, Biden has said that he backs codifying Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision, into federal law. That ruling guaranteed a woman’s right to an abortion before the end of the first trimester, but permits additional regulations or prohibitions on terminating a pregnancy once a fetus becomes viable outside the womb.

Furthermore, killing an infant after it is born is illegal, and Biden does not condone that.

Pence’s statement is a reference to Biden’s recent reversal on the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding from being used to pay for an abortion unless the mother’s life is in danger or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. In practice, it has meant that many abortions, including abortions in the first trimester, are not available to low-income people on Medicaid and other governmental health insurance programs. Biden previously supported Hyde, but said in June 2019 he had changed his mind.

It’s worth iterating how uncommon abortions are further into pregnancy. According to a 2018 CDC report, 65.4 percent of abortions in 2015 were performed within the first eight weeks of pregnancy and 91.1 percent occurred by the end of the first trimester. Only 1.3 percent of abortions were done after 21 weeks, or about halfway through gestation.

Immigration

Continuing a talking point that has pervaded the Republican convention, Pence falsely claimed “Joe Biden is for open borders.”

As FactCheck.org has written, Biden supports a more open and welcoming immigration policy than the one championed by Trump. In 2013, Biden supported the so-called Gang of Eight immigration bill that would have provided a path to earned citizenship for those then in the country illegally, but which also would have included significant investments in border security (including 350 miles of new fencing). During the campaign, Biden has vowed that he will halt construction of any more border wall, though he has stopped short of saying he would dismantle any fencing constructed during the Trump administration.

“I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry — that’s where all the bad stuff is happening,” Biden said in an interview on Aug. 5.

The border wall

Pence was misleading when he said Trump has “secured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall.”

According to an Aug. 7 story in the San Antonio Express-News, only five miles of new fencing have been constructed. The paper said 260 miles of replacement and secondary walls have been built. The border is about 2,000 miles. The paper said its story was based on data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

A wall on the Mexican border to keep out immigrants trying to illegally cross the border was a major campaign issue in 2016 for Trump and a frequent rallying cry since. Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall.

FactCheck.org’s June 5 story reported that 194 miles of new fencing had been built under Trump as of May 22 and included only about “3 miles of new border wall system constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed,” according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The Trump administration has allocated funding for 400 miles of replacement walls, 57 miles of new secondary fencing and 281 miles of new primary walls, the Express-News said.

School choice

Pence wrongly claimed that “Biden wants to end school choice.”

As FactCheck.org has written, Biden opposes federal funding going to “for-profit charter schools,” but schools managed by for-profit companies make up only a fraction of charter schools. The current percentage of charter schools that contract with Education Management Organizations, or EMOs — which are for-profit entities hired to manage charter schools — is about 10 percent, a researcher for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools told us in July.

And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition — the ultimate in school choice for some — he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools.

According to a statement provided by a Biden campaign official to FactCheck.org in July, “VP Biden will do everything he can to help traditional public schools, which is what most students attend. As president, he will ban for-profit charter schools from receiving federal funds. He will also make sure that we stop funding charter schools that don’t provide results.” The campaign added that Biden “does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to … high-performing public charters.”

Veterans Choice

Promoting Trump’s actions on behalf of veterans, Pence gave a misleading summary of the evolution of the Veterans Choice Program.

“And after years of scandal that robbed our veterans of the care that you earned in the uniform of the United States, President Trump kept his word again,” he said, referring to excessively long wait times for patients treated at VA hospitals. “We reformed the VA and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in America.”

While Pence makes it seem as though the president was the one to implement changes to improve wait times and health care for veterans, the Veterans Choice Program got its start well before Trump entered office.

The program allowed veterans to seek health care outside the VA system if individuals lived far from VA facilities or had difficulty getting an appointment. Obama signed bipartisan legislation creating the program in August 2014.

Trump continued the program, and in July 2018 signed the VA MISSION Act — another piece of bipartisan legislation — that extended Veterans Choice for another year and then replaced the program with the Veterans Community Care Program, which began in June 2019.

The new program is similar, but more expansive. According to a 2018 Congressional Budget Office report, the Veterans Community Care Program is expected to refer an additional 640,000 veterans outside the VA health system in its early years. Still, there are eligibility requirements that veterans must meet to be able to receive care through the program.

Joe Biden’s euphoric campaign staff had overtaken Philadelphia’s National Constitution Center. It was March 10, and Biden’s three primary victories that night, with two more on the way, all but confirmed he would be the Democratic nominee. The celebration for the momentous feat was supposed to be at a large rally in Ohio, not in a foyer in a museum down the street from his campaign headquarters, but as the coronavirus gained a toehold in a few US cities, a large gathering was deemed too dangerous. The shift in venue, for the moment, did nothing to dampen staffers’ spirits as they rushed to embrace one another and danced awkwardly to a Whitney Houston remix that blared through the speakers after their boss finished his victory speech.

Back at Biden HQ, the quartet of television screens hung along an office wall began to broadcast grim news about the staggering rate of infections and possible death toll. The next day, the World Health Organization would declare COVID-19 a pandemic, and smaller gatherings, too, would soon be scrapped. The outbreak would not only curtail future campaign events, but also plunge the nation into a public health crisis, the likes of which the country hadn’t experienced in a century.

Until that point, Biden had threaded the primary gauntlet with a message based on big-picture themes—electability, experience, and his frequent campaign pledge to restore America’s “soul.” For much of the campaign, his policy shop consisted of just three to four generalists huddled at a few desks near the communications team in Biden HQ; they produced a platform that largely hewed to Democrats’ consensus agenda. But as the coronavirus spread misery and death through March, it became clear that the nation’s soul might not be the first thing that needed saving in a Biden presidency.

By April, the Biden team had begun fleshing out its policy ranks with dozens of outside advisers. Jake Sullivan, who became Biden’s senior policy adviser this summer, organized two daily Zoom briefings for the presumptive Democratic nominee: One with public health experts and another with economists. But just as Biden assumed the mantle of the Democratic Party, Bloomberg reported that one of those advisers was Larry Summers, the Harvard economist who served as Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration and as chair of the National Economic Council—which drives the White House’s economic strategy—under Obama. A reviled figure on the left, he epitomized a coziness with Wall Street that they had hoped to purge from the party. Among progressives who favored Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Summers’ apparent role confirmed that Biden was the status quo candidate they’d believed him to be. In May, more than two dozen left-leaning groups—from MoveOn to Greenpeace to the Justice Democrats—signed a letter demanding Summers’ removal from the campaign.

The Summers contretemps quickly died down (and Summers later announced, to the relief of the left, that he was leaving politics altogether). But to the Biden camp, the episode was exactly the type of intraparty skirmish they had hoped to avoid. Since the Obama years, economic policy had become the bloodiest theater of Dem-on-Dem clashes, and Biden still hadn’t fully won over the supporters of his former primary opponents. In its aftermath, the campaign became increasingly reticent to discuss who Biden was turning to for economic advice. Stories written on the subject skated over the specifics and produced headlines such as this one from the New York Times: “Biden’s Brain Trust on the Economy: Liberal and Sworn to Silence.” Aides downplayed the influence of individuals while taking pains to stress that they’ve cast a wide net to include the whole spectrum of Democratic thought, ranging from Obama-era bureaucrats to the sorts of lefty thinkers embraced by Bernie Sanders.

Still, I wanted to understand who was shaping the Democratic candidate’s economic vision, since the economy would be an immediate and critical battlefield for a Biden administration. I spoke with nearly 40 campaign aides, outside experts, Democratic operatives, and Obama administration alumni who pointed me in the direction of the three PhD economists who have regularly briefed Biden since the beginning of the pandemic: Jared Bernstein, Ben Harris, and Heather Boushey. Each hail from distinct wings and eras of Democratic economic thought. Bernstein, who served as Biden’s chief economist in the White House, is a lefty labor-aligned thinker who has been waiting for the political moment to meet his ideas. Harris, who succeeded Bernstein, came up through a neoliberal branch viewed with suspicion by progressives but has emerged as a key translator for Biden’s populist and pragmatic tendencies. Boushey is a liberal economist whose ideas about inequality—particularly, how it affects families—have made her a wonk for this time of pandemic and peril. While each of them are informal advisers with no official campaign role, they have been key influences on Biden’s economic thinking and plans, and will likely continue to be if Biden wins the White House.

If elected, Biden will inherit an unprecedented economic crisis. Unlike the 2008 meltdown, this mess is complicated by a virus that does not respond to Keynesian remedies. But one lesson does carry over: The wonks in the room matter. Biden is likely to face a familiar political dynamic: a progressive movement wary of his centrism and a Republican Party horrified anew by government spending with Biden in the White House instead of Trump. What will Biden consider as he navigates treacherous economic conditions and political dangers? The cadre of economists who regularly have his ear provide some hints.

Jeff Connaughton, a longtime Biden aide, offered a scathing view of his former boss’s economic acumen in a 2012 tell-all memoir: Biden and Obama were “financially illiterate” when they entered office and took charge of (what was then) the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. During his 36-year Senate career, Biden was best known for chairing the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees, neither of which directly dealt with economic matters. Hailing from Delaware, a state where corporations outnumber citizens, he became known as the “Senator from MBNA,” and he famously championed a 2005 bankruptcy bill backed by big banks and credit card companies that made it harder for debt-ridden Americans to relieve their obligations to creditors.

“I think Biden in 2005 was pretty different in this space than he was in 2009—he’s really different,” Jared Bernstein told my colleague Tim Murphy last year. Indeed, bearing witness to the economic carnage of the last recession reshaped much of Biden’s thinking. But so, too, did Bernstein, the man chosen in December 2008 to fill the newly created role of chief economist to the vice president.

Bernstein was a bit of an oddity among the team of Harvard, MIT, and University of Chicago-trained economists in the Obama White House. For one thing, his first passion was music: He’d spent his undergraduate years studying jazz double bass at the Manhattan School of Music. A stint as a New York City social worker inspired Bernstein to pursue a PhD in social welfare at Columbia University, where Bernstein learned traditional economics, but as a means to examine how markets had failed vulnerable populations. He became enchanted with the work of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist best known for prescribing government intervention during economic downturns, an idea that challenged the notion—especially ascendant during Bernstein’s grad school days in the 1980s—that free markets fixed themselves. Bernstein is still quick to rhapsodize on the long-dead scholar who nudged FDR to spend expansively on the New Deal. “If you read Keynes,” he told me, “you’ll see something else that I try to live by: an unending optimism that we can do better—that good, inclusive, empirically driven ideas can beat out bad ones.”

Bernstein arrived in Washington in 1992 to work under labor economist Lawrence Mishel at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning, labor-aligned think tank founded six years earlier at a time when pro-free trade, anti-union philosophy dominated economic thought. The duo—”the Lennon and McCartney of economics,” Mishel recalls Bernstein calling them—uncovered what was then a new and concerning development: The economy was more productive than ever, but workers’ wages remained flat. They placed the blame for that on the policy choices that had decimated worker power. “[Bernstein and Mishel] were pushing that at a time when that was seen as a very, very strange view,” says Dean Baker, a labor economist who worked with Mishel and Bernstein at EPI and co-authored books with Bernstein on full employment.

Not surprisingly, they found themselves at odds with top economists in the Clinton White House, populated by disciples of deregulation, such as Larry Summers and Robert Rubin, who had blamed the plight of American workers on automation. Bernstein spent a year working as a junior economist in Robert Reich’s Labor Department, though he largely focused on pushing the Clinton administration to the left from outside the government. Occasionally, he penned essays for the American Prospect, the magazine co-founded by Reich, where he made clear that he saw neither political party as friendly to his beliefs. In a 2002 piece, Bernstein bemoaned “the ceaseless and sole emphasis on supply-side economics” in which Democrats prescribed job training and Republicans prescribed tax cuts. “You’ve got to be willing to mess with markets,” he wrote. “You need to embrace the conviction that there are times when the invisible hand needs a nudge in the right direction.”

During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, Bernstein lent his expertise to all of the candidates running—though he favored John Edwards’ populist economic agenda. Once the field narrowed and the economy jumped the tracks, he became a more regular adviser to Obama. “I think he reached out to progressive economists, among others, who had a narrative similar to his own,” Bernstein recalls of Obama. “Among others” turned out to be the same Rubinites Bernstein had clashed with more than a decade earlier.

After Obama’s victory, Summers took the helm of Obama’s National Economics Council, while Timothy Geithner was installed as Treasury Secretary. Bernstein was hired as Biden’s adviser, a match in keeping with Biden’s touted ties to labor and the vice president-elect’s interest in ensuring ways the economic recovery could, in particular, boost the middle class. Among his new White House colleagues, Bernstein almost always represented the most liberal perspective in the room, though he tried to downplay any tensions at the time; he and Rubin even wrote a New York Times op-ed together to prove it.* But his view was not always welcome. Baker remembers Bernstein recounting an uncomfortable episode with Summers after Obama invited Bernstein to join a meeting of his top advisers. “Obama sees Jared and goes, ‘Oh, why don’t you come to this?’” Baker recalls. “And apparently Summers is glaring at him the whole time, like ‘What are you doing here?'”

Bernstein advocated for an “all gas, no brake” approach to the stimulus that the Obama White House was crafting to revive the economy, wanting more than what some of his White House colleagues and the politics would allow. He liked the idea of singling out US manufacturing for government support to resuscitate failing industries, even when Obama’s other wonks were much more skeptical. As journalist Michael Grunwald explained in his book, The New New Deal, Bernstein heeded Obama’s call for transformational New Deal-style programs, pitching programs akin to a Works Progress Administration, such as grants to help cities hire the unemployed for a range of jobs, such as cleaning up blighted neighborhoods and digitizing public records. Biden had been a champion of the administration’s job creation efforts, but Bernstein’s specific ideas ultimately went nowhere. “There wasn’t a lot of appetite for a new WPA,” Bernstein told Grunwald.

Democrats and economists of nearly all walks now agree that the stimulus was too small, but Republicans couldn’t be persuaded to pass another package, and in the 2010 election the Obama administration paid the price. Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives, and the White House signaled a return to balanced budgets and austerity. Bernstein left his job with Biden a few months later. In May 2011, he reemerged with a new blog, explaining that his departure had not been, “as some accounts suggested, because ideas that I was associated with, like more stimulus, are off the table”—though he added he was “not happy about that.” Instead, he said he had been frustrated with the political economic discourse. “When you’re on the inside at a time like this, you’re constantly balancing the risk of losing the support of people you need to lead,” he wrote. “I’m going to try to do my part to improve the debate from the outside.”

The vice president’s chief economist post sat vacant for three years after Bernstein’s departure. A GOP-controlled House held the hopes of further recovery funding hostage, and when Republicans seized control of the Senate during the 2014 midterms, the rest of the Obama administration agenda was about to be railroaded, too. After those midterms, Steve Ricchetti, then Biden’s chief of staff, reached out to an economist from a different school of thought than Bernstein’s to fill the role: Ben Harris, policy director of the Hamilton Project, a neoliberal think tank within the centrist Brookings Institution that had been founded by Robert Rubin.

Politics had been Ben Harris’ first love; economics, by his own admission, was an accident. As a high schooler on Bainbridge Island in Washington state, he was a sports busybody, student body treasurer, and attended Boys Nation, the highly selective weeklong government crash course for high school juniors in DC, where he met then-President Clinton. At Tufts University, he majored in economics because it offered an easier pathway into the school’s competitive semester in Washington program. “It was a good early lesson in game theory—a branch of economics that accounts for the actions of others when deciding what’s best for you,” Harris told his hometown newspaper in 2015.

Save for completing his undergraduate work in 1999 and a pair of masters’ degrees from Columbia and Cornell, Harris never really left DC after that Washington semester. He took a job at Brookings working under William Gale, a Brookings fixture who had briefly served as an economist in George H. W. Bush’s administration. Their research focused primarily on taxes and budgets; their conclusions often warned of the nation’s unsustainable fiscal deficit while calling for tax increases, often on high earners. Their proposal for a value-added tax—essentially, a sales tax on every stage of the production process—gained traction among lawmakers in the wake of the Great Recession to fill the gaping fiscal hole the downturn and stimulus spending caused. As he churned out white papers by day, Harris attended classes for his PhD at George Washington University at night.

Gale recommended Harris to Austan Goolsbee, chair of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors—the White House’s in-house economic think tank—who was looking for someone with a public finance background to round out his team of staff economists. Harris had plenty of experience in that and, unlike the typical CEA egghead, he’d actually done policy work in Washington, not academia. Among his projects, he provided the research underpinning Obama’s proposed 2012 corporate tax overhaul that would have lowered the corporate tax rate to 28 percent. His unrealized recommendations have resurfaced in Biden’s campaign platform (though Biden now wants to raise the tax to that rate after Trump slashed it to 21 percent). In 2013 he went back to Brookings, but was back at the White House nearly two years later.

The role of chief economist had been resurrected because Biden, in the twilight of his vice presidency, wanted to dive back into economic policy. By the end of 2014, unemployment had retreated from its Great Recession peak, but as the recovery unfolded, Biden had two chief concerns. One was stagnant wages—a side effect, Biden believed, of weakened worker power. Another had to do with a troubling corporate trend: Public companies that had received massive infusions of taxpayer funds at the dawn of the financial crisis were now using their earnings to buy back their stock, a strategy that improved share prices and passed that value onto investors, not workers. Before taking the job as Biden’s economic adviser, Harris met with the VP’s policy director, who plopped a tall stack of literature on stock buybacks down in front of him. “From a macro perspective, things were looking pretty good,” Harris told me this spring, “but when you looked under the hood, things weren’t so good.” (Harris declined to comment for this story.)

With the House and Senate firmly under GOP control, the only available pathway to achieving any of Biden’s ambitions would be through executive orders, which offered some success: In May 2016, Biden announced new rules that extended overtime benefits to more than 4 million workers. (The Trump administration has since rolled it back). During his second stint in the Obama administration, Harris encountered a vice president whose ideas about labor in the post-Great Recession economy had been pretty firmly set, thanks in no small part to the work he’d done with Bernstein. Harris brought his own set of pet issues: taxes, budgets, corporate governance, and public investment. Biden showed an openness to new ideas Harris brought him; unlike Obama, who often leaned on his economic advisers for a final-sign off, the vice president and his chief economist would have hours-long discussions about economic philosophy. Over the next two years, an economic vision emerged that bore the influence of both Harris and his predecessor—and previewed economic themes like worker protections, a modern tax code, and improved infrastructure that would define Biden’s 2020 run.

Harris kept a lower profile than his predecessor, but Harris’ former White House colleagues have described him as a Biden whisperer, someone who demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of the vice president’s positions and a loyalty to put them above any of his own. “I think that he feels unusually comfortable with the vice president, and I think they communicate a lot, they see eye to eye,” says Adam Looney, an economist who preceded Harris as the Hamilton Project’s policy director. “And I think he’s good at identifying what the vice president wants to achieve and channeling them.”

When the Obama administration ended, Harris advised an asset management company and opened his own consulting firm, but he never really left Biden’s orbit. He worked with the former vice president on his speeches, wrote occasional policy memos for Biden, and edited the Biden Forum, a blog that elevated ideas from a cross-section of Democratic wonks on the future of the middle class. Harris’ recent research on competitive labor markets showed up in a 2018 speech Biden gave on conditions to support higher wages. When Biden weighed whether to enter the 2020 race, Harris was among a small group of former aides he consulted, and Biden brought Harris on as an informal economic adviser as soon as the campaign kicked off.

Harris and Bernstein were old Biden hands, but in March the campaign recruited another economist: Heather Boushey, the president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning economic think tank spun off from the Center for American Progress.

Boushey’s upbringing in the 1970s Seattle suburbs was an object lesson in the middle-class squeeze. Her father was a union machinist who built for Boeing; her mother worked as a bookkeeper to make ends’ meet. When Boeing laid off Boushey’s father in the early 1980s, her mother told her middle school-aged daughter that her swim team membership, $100 a month, might be on hold until her father resumed work. “That was the moment that I realized that actually economics—whether or not my parents have a job—affects whether or not I get to do the things that matter to me in my life,” she told the New York Times earlier this year. (Boushey, who has a strict policy of not discussing her work with the Biden campaign, declined to comment for this story).

Boushey resolved to become an economist in high school; an AP US History teacher suggested it might be the best application for her exceptional math skills and nascent fascination with political philosophy. But she got there via an iconoclastic route. She attended Hampshire College, the avant-garde liberal arts school where students design their own curriculums and receive written evaluations in lieu of grades, and then an economics PhD at the New School, a program at the New York City institution known for producing scholars who challenge neoclassical economic thought. (In the staid world of DC professional fashion, Boushey is the sort who showed up for that recent New York Times interview wearing a Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks t-shirt.)

Her unconventional training prepared her for a career in DC’s left-leaning think tanks: Boushey cycled through EPI and the even-leftier Center for Economic Policy and Research before she landed at the Center for American Progress in December 2008. Her early research, like Bernstein’s the previous decade, argued that boons of a productive economy were barely realized by its workers, but she zeroed in on a particular symptom of wage stagnation she’d seen in her childhood: How women moving out of the home and into the labor market created its own set of expensive disruptions. Boushey frequently appeared on Capitol Hill to testify that raising the minimum wage, paid sick leave, and affordable childcare weren’t the job killers they’d long been touted as, but crucial to a productive economy because they reduced absenteeism and workforce turnover. The Great Recession’s path of destruction only served to crystalize what Boushey had observed about the structural weaknesses that left families vulnerable.

Boushey first met Biden in 2009 when she participated in a roundtable for the vice president’s Task Force on the Middle Class, but she would end up being another Democratic politician’s star wonk. She joined Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign as one of its first informal policy advisers. Clinton’s first major economic address of the campaign—delivered at the New School, Boushey’s alma mater—touched on Boushey’s greatest hits: A decline in workforce participation among women, childcare, and paid family leave. Throughout the campaign, Boushey would raise her argument that equality and economic growth go hand in hand to defend Clinton against attacks from her opponent, Bernie Sanders, whose own run prized redistribution above all else.

“Heather [looks] at how a society treats its workers—in the beginning of her career, women workers, but now all workers—as a way to judge a society,” says Teresa Ghilarducci, a economist at the New School who, like Boushey, informally advised Clinton’s campaign.

As the campaign neared the general election—and Clinton’s victory looked all but guaranteed—Boushey was named chief economist of Clinton’s transition team and she was rumored to be in the running for a top economic post in the new administration. But, of course, Clinton didn’t win. Boushey returned to the think tank she founded and wrote a new book on inequality and its drag on individual and aggregate growth. As the 2020 race heated up, Boushey’s advice was consulted by nearly all of the candidates, but once the pandemic hit, her ideas became urgent. “There’s kind of two core ideas that have animated a lot of Heather’s work: One is about gender and the economy, and one is about inequality in the economy more broadly,” says Michael Linden, a founder of the Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning economic think tank. “Both of those are ridiculously relevant right now.”

The Build Back Better plan, Biden’s four-pillar federal stimulus proposal developed in the wake of the coronavirus crisis and introduced in July, is in many ways a redo of the 2009 stimulus law—a combination of public spending and tax credits—except with far more ambitious goals: $2 trillion to boost clean energy and infrastructure, $300 billion to spur US-based research and development, $400 billion aimed at American manufacturing, a $775 billion caregiving proposal, and billions more to fund clean energy and address stark racial inequities that the coronavirus crisis laid bare. And every Biden aide goes out of their way to stress that the ideas are all Joe Biden’s. After nearly a half-century in federal office, they argue, the former vice president knows who he is and what he wants.

“I understand why some people are trying to pinpoint where the vice president is headed based on who is advising him, but I think, respectfully, that is the wrong way to do it,” Stef Feldman, the Biden campaign’s policy director, tells me. “It almost also doesn’t matter who is advising him because they are not shaping his values and principles. They are shaping the data that gets input so he can shape policies that align with those principles.”

The data, of course, matters—it’s the grounding Biden leans on to move comfortably on any policy decision. Sources close to the campaign say Harris hews a little closer to Biden’s own political instincts: While quite liberal on matters of labor, he’s been described as a more moderate influence, primarily in the way he raises concern about what the long tail of Biden’s proposed several trillions in stimulus spending might do the country’s fiscal stability. “I worry really deeply about the deficit—I have for my entire career and that hasn’t changed,” Harris told me in July, but added that he supports swift and intense government intervention in emergencies like the one currently facing the country. “If moderate means that he thinks about the costs as well as the benefits, then yes, he’s a moderate,” William Gale, Harris’ old Brookings boss, tells me. “If moderate means pessimistic about what government can do, then no, I don’t think he’s a moderate.”

Bernstein and Boushey, meanwhile, are among those urging Biden to the left and to embrace more ambitious proposals. “I’m really delighted that both of them are there,” Dean Baker says. “They bring somewhat different perspectives, but they’re both very important. And, you know, to my view, it’s a world of difference from 2009 when Jared was there but very much on the outside, and Heather wasn’t there at all.”

If you look closely at Build Back Better, you see the trademarks of Bernstein, Boushey, and Harris. The various fiscal and monetary recommendations for getting to full employment show Bernstein’s touch. Aspects of Biden’s proposal to expand affordable child care—and to pay those who provide that care well—appears lifted from the pages of Boushey’s book on the subject, Finding Time. The $4 trillion tax proposals to pay for the permanent pieces of the plan are, as Gale put it to me, Harris’ “bread and butter.” (Bernstein also reunited with a conservatory classmate to write a theme song for the proposal.) Where Biden may have entered the White House last time with economic views shaped more by his home state’s pro-corporate ethos, it’s clear Bernstein and Harris’ stints working with him at the White House led to different, more sophisticated views on the economy, and since Boushey joined the squad, Biden’s plans have reflected more expansive thinking than they did during the primary.

In the campaign’s final stretch, Harris has continued to work closely with Jake Sullivan on the development of economic-related policy. Boushey led an outside advisory group of hundreds of economists shaping how Biden might turn his campaign platform into executable policy. Bernstein has joined the transition’s advisory board. The economic briefings have continued, but on an ad-hoc, not daily, basis. On a campaign that’s been conducted largely over Zoom and email, it’s impossible to gauge what influence any one person is having, and that influence can vary from day-to-day. A broader group of regulars—including Austan Goolsbee, former Clinton and Obama NEC chair Gene Sperling, and AFL-CIO economist Bill Spriggs—also weigh in on policy details. Jeff Zients, another Obama NEC chair and a wealthy investor with deep business ties who now co-chair’s Biden’s transition team, also has the candidate’s ear on economic matters. And, of course, there’s a tight-knit team of longtime political advisers who touch every decision Biden makes.

In the words of one Obama administration alum who knows all three well, they feel confident in Bernstein, Boushey, and Harris’ influences because “you can see the imprint of their work in what’s happening” and “they fit very clearly into the vice president’s mindset” about the current crisis. “It’s a team that helps you manage, if you’re a president, your human capital in your society,” the New School’s Ghilarducci said, citing Bernstein’s focus on the poor, Boushey’s emphasis on workers, and Harris’ technical expertise.

The tea leaf reading is about to be rendered moot, anyways. If Biden wins, he’ll set in motion a massive transition operation that will bestow official government titles, and Bernstein, Boushey, and Harris are all expected to have some kind of role. Some progressives are pushing to see Boushey chair the CEA and for Bernstein to get a promotion to NEC chair (though folks in the Warren and Sanders wings of the party will tell you that Bernstein and Boushey are not as progressive as the people their candidates would have hired.) The opinions speak to the fact that the relationship between the moderate and progressive wings remain uneasy.

Democrats have uniformly gotten over whatever sticker shock plagued the 2009 recovery—especially since Congress already passed $2.2 trillion in stimulus earlier this year. The deficit hawks have been relatively assuaged by the fact that interest rates—the key ingredient to making a bad debt worse—have remained low, and they accept the ongoing recession will only be remedied by a massive cash infusion. What a President Biden would hope to pass in January probably looks a lot like the $3 trillion program the House Democrats passed in June.

It’s what comes after this stimulus that might trigger a fight within the party, with friction between those in Biden’s ranks pushing for bolder policies and those more cautious about the political impacts. Boushey, at least, has hinted that she (and likely Bernstein) is already thinking about more ambitious structural change. Speaking to the New York Times last week, Boushey noted that a “timely, targeted, and temporary” stimulus made sense for the 2009, but not now. “This problem feels different,” she said, “because it’s unearthed these really important structural challenges that need to be solved.”

A lot could stand in the way of even the most modest planks of Biden’s platform. Without an end to the Senate filibuster—something Biden has yet to support—there’s a good chance Senate Republicans can block his promised policies, even if they are bounced to the minority. But how the White House approaches those battles will begin with which wonks control the flow of information that reach a would-be President Biden and shape whether he ends up championing a massive social works program that restructures the economy or a band-aid that patches up the problems of pandemic-era America."

Wearing a black boot on the right foot he recently fractured while playing with one of his dogs, Biden appeared in his home city, Wilmington, Delaware, for an event that stressed the gravity of the situation but sought to offer hope.

“We’re going to create a recovery for everybody,” Biden said. “Our message to everybody struggling right now is this: help is on the way.”

Biden’s nominations would put several women in top economic roles, drawing a clear contrast with Donald Trump and reflecting his commitment to diversity.

They include Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate will be the first woman to lead the US treasury in its 231-year history. Biden said he “might have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical about the first treasury secretary, [Alexander] Hamilton, to write another musical” about his new nominee.

Yellen led the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, focusing on maximising employment and less on price inflation. In remarks on Tuesday, she noted the damage caused by the pandemic.

“Lost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good,” she said. “So many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent.

“It’s an American tragedy and it’s essential we move with urgency. Inaction will cause a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems.”

Biden’s nominees have all expressed support for government spending to boost employment, reduce inequality and help women and people of colour, disproportionately harmed by the downturn.

But they will face stiff headwinds from the pandemic, now estimated to be killing one American a minute. The US has 4% of the world’s population but 19% of its coronavirus deaths – more than 268,000 – with record caseloads and hospitalisations forcing renewed economic restrictions in some states.

November saw the biggest two-week jump in unemployment benefit applications since April. Several aid programmes are set to expire this month, although a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled a $908bn relief bill on Tuesday in an effort to break a political stalemate.

Biden said: “The team I’m announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action starting on day one and move fast to revive this economy.”

His “Build Back Better” plan, he said, was based on a simple proposition: “Reward hard work in America, not wealth. It’s time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing and so much more that will create millions of good-paying jobs. It’s time we addressed the structural inequities in our economy that this pandemic has laid bare.”

Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; the economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as council members; and Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress thinktank, as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

“I’ve known Neera a long time,” Biden said. “A brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream, and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles millions of Americans are facing.”

Biden noted that Tanden would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB. But she has already proved his most divisive pick, drawing criticism from Republicans. Some analysts suggest she is a “sacrificial lamb”, likely to be denied confirmation in a fight that might distract attention from other nominees.

Since being nominated, Tanden has deleted more than a thousand tweets, some of which were critical of senators who will vote on her confirmation, the Daily Beast reported.

Claire McCaskill, a former senator from Missouri, told MSNBC: “It’s a whole new level of hypocrisy. The Republican senators are now all of a sudden worried about tweets that hurt their feelings. This is just ridiculous.

“We’ve had a president who has used his Twitter account like a battering ram, going after not just his political opponents but Republican senators, unfairly, with incredibly brutal tweets. Now all of a sudden it’s a disqualification for someone to serve in the cabinet that engaged in her own opinion on Twitter? I think that’s dumb.”

Tanden has also been unpopular on the left, having been a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Sanders’s 2020 campaign, tweeted: “Everything toxic about the corporate Democratic party is embodied in Neera Tanden.”

For Biden, Tuesday’s sober and determined presentation was the latest sign that the transition is gathering unstoppable momentum despite Trump’s false claims of vote rigging and refusal to concede.

On Monday, Biden received his first full classified intelligence briefing since winning the 3 November election, after Trump delayed the process for weeks. And Arizona and Wisconsin officially recognised Biden’s victory, meaning Trump’s legal team has lost six of six attempts to stop states certifying their results. Trump has pursued challenges in numerous states but most have been tossed out.

Yet the president continues his quixotic effort. The Trump campaign on Tuesday asked the Wisconsin supreme court to determine if 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information should be excluded from vote totals. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes.

The electoral college, which selects the president based on state-by-state results, is scheduled to meet on 14 December. Biden will take office on 20 January."

As the U.S. descends into its ninth month of economic crisis, millions of Americans who have lost their jobs face imminent eviction, the end of a federally backed unemployment extension, and a lack of certainty about where their next meal will come from. Without a comprehensive stimulus package in sight, President-elect Joe Biden and his economic team must now prepare to shoulder an unprecedented burden on top of the COVID-19 health crisis when they enter office in January.

Indicating that economic recovery will be a top priority during his first 100 days in office, Biden has wasted no time in filling out his team, a group of advisers whom he has worked with and has come to trust through his 50 years in public service. But some argue that in an attempt to pull the U.S. out of its pandemic-adjacent slump, the President-elect’s administration has relied too heavily on the old guard, borrowing heavily from the Clinton and Obama administrations, instead of including new and progressive voices on the team that will shape economic policy for at least the next four years.

“I know times are tough, but I want you to know that help is on the way,” Biden said as he announced his team last week. “From the most unequal economic and job crisis in modern history, we can build a new American economy that works for all Americans, not just some.”

A few choices, like former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary, were both expected and accepted by the dueling factions of the Democratic Party. Other names, however, provoked anger and confusion from progressives.

Center for American Progress president Neera Tanden, Biden’s pick to run the Office of Management and Budget, has long been a staunch critic of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ economic policy and has proposed (at least passively) cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. During a 2012 C-SPAN interview, she explained her opinions: “If we’re going to have a deal to address long-term deficit reduction, we need to put both entitlements on the table, as well as taxes.

“We should have savings on entitlements, and the Center for American Progress has put forward ideas on proposals to reform the beneficiary structure of Social Security. Some of our progressive allies aren’t as excited about that as we are,” she continued.

Still, progressives mostly expressed befuddlement at the pick and not outright ire. “Neera Tanden is not a pick progressives would have chosen, but she’s better than [Biden’s former Chief of Staff] Bruce Reed,” Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, said in a statement. “Tanden’s on the record over the past several years pushing back against nonsensical worries about the deficit.”

So who will be a part of Biden’s A-Team, and how will they work to end the COVID-adjacent economic dip? Here are the people he’s hoping to nominate, and the roles they’ll take on if approved.

Janet L. Yellen, Treasury secretary

As head of the Treasury, Yellen will have a say in everything from climate change prevention to tax policy to stimulus spending. The increasingly outsize role of Treasury secretary requires both nuance and versatility, but Yellen is well known and trusted among D.C. leaders, thanks to her four years as chair of the Federal Reserve and another 15 serving at the national bank.

Yellen has indicated that a large stimulus package will be her first line of attack against recession. “Lost lives, lost jobs. Small businesses struggling to stay alive are closed for good. So many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent. It’s an American tragedy,” she said during a recent speech in Delaware. “And it is essential we move with urgency. Inaction will produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation.”

If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen would be the first woman to hold the role of Treasury secretary, and the 74-year-old labor economist has a good chance of making it through a Republican-held Senate. Republicans have praised her qualifications—something that sets her apart from other members of Biden’s economics team.

“I believe that she would get a favorable view,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley. Sen. John Cornyn, who acts as a top adviser to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also said he believed she was qualified for the job. “I think she’s fine. I don’t have any problems with her,” said Cornyn. “My attitude is that, absent conflicts of interest or other, you know, lack of temperament and über-partisanship, that beyond those that the Vice President should get the people that he wants.”

Yellen was also able to win the support of almost a dozen GOP senators in 2014 when she was nominated to head the Federal Reserve.

During her confirmation hearing, Yellen will likely face tough questions from the GOP about emergency lending programs that were created during the March COVID stimulus bill, but she is otherwise expected to breeze into her new role.

Wally Adeyemo, deputy Treasury secretary

Adeyemo, a Nigerian-born attorney who served as a senior international economic adviser during the Obama administration and then as president of the Obama Foundation, is Biden’s pick for second in command at the Treasury.

Adeyemo has a long history with and deep institutional knowledge of the U.S. Treasury. He also served there as senior adviser and deputy chief of staff during the Obama administration.

But while Adeyemo appears to be a safe, establishment choice, he also has a history of supporting open trade with China. He helped craft the since rejected Trans-Pacific Partnership proposal—an idea that is no longer as in vogue in Congress as it once was.

Some on the left also have concerns about Adeyemo’s post–Obama administration choice to join BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, as a senior adviser and chief of staff to CEO Larry Fink.

Still, Adeyemo has a history of straddling two worlds and merging the different factions of the Democratic Party. He began his career at the Treasury in 2008 working for then-Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and was able to move seamlessly to work under more progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where he served as her chief of staff. Both Warren and Geithner have highly praised the work he did for them.

When introduced by Biden last week, Adeyemo touched on his goals of bolstering America’s middle class and reducing income inequality. “In California’s Inland Empire, where I had grown up in a working-class neighborhood, the Great Recession hit us hard,” he said. “We were one of the foreclosure capitals of the United States. The pain of this was real for me.”

If nominated, Adeyemo will be the first Black American to serve in the role.

Cecilia Rouse, chair of Council of Economic Advisers

Like many of Biden’s economic picks, Rouse has a long history in the White House. The current dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs served on President Bill Clinton’s National Economic Council and then on President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, the group she is expected to chair under Biden.

In her acceptance of Biden’s nomination last week, the economist said her focus would be on future of labor and workers, including short-term pandemic-related issues and longer-term economic shifts toward a gig economy.

She’s spent much of the pandemic advocating for workers who she feared might face the same long-term unemployment issues that those in the 2008 Great Recession did. She pushed to institute a new law “that mandates (and perhaps subsidizes) paid sick leave, which has been shown to reduce turnover, increase productivity, and lower overall health care costs for employers.”

Biden has also emphasized Rouse’s background in the economics of education, which is an increasing concern as schools around the country remain closed, disproportionately hurting low-income students.

In Delaware last week, with Biden by her side, Rouse called COVID-19 a “devastating crisis” but said that it also presented “an opportunity to build a better economy in its wake—an economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities, and leaves no one to fall through the cracks.”

If approved by the Senate, Rouse would be the first Black CEA chair. Rouse was previously confirmed to become a member of the CEA in 2009 when Democrats controlled the Senate but has not had to face a hearing in front of a Republican-led body.

Early in his term, President Trump downgraded the CEA chair role from a cabinet position, but Biden said last Tuesday he would reverse that decision.

Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein, Council of Economic Advisers

Jared Bernstein, known around D.C. for his affable nature, is a longtime economic adviser and friend to Biden. He served during the Obama administration as the former Vice President’s top economic adviser. Since leaving the White House, he’s taken on the role of senior fellow at left-leaning think tank the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

He also appeases the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party. He’s pushed for both a wealth tax and a jobs guarantee, two ideas that are far to the left of Biden’s economic policy. “His inclination on many economic issues has been close to agreement with Bernie Sanders’,” Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ 2020 campaign manager, told The Atlantic earlier this year.

Heather Boushey, the president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, also has a long history in the Beltway. She’s worked with and testified before Congress as an economist for the Center for American Progress, the congressional Joint Economic Committee, the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and the Economic Policy Institute. In 2016, it was announced that she would take the role of chief economist on the Clinton-Kaine transition team had Clinton won, and she served as an economic counselor to Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.

Boushey runs in a small circle with Bernstein, Yellen, and other progressive economists who believe that expanding social safety net programs to help the poor and middle class will improve the economy overall. In her research and work, Boushey has focused on the importance of the family unit and support for working mothers, something that will likely continue in the White House.

Neera Tanden, director of the Office of Management and Budget

Though Tanden is perhaps Biden’s most controversial pick, she’s also well known around the White House and Capitol. And her various controversies haven’t stopped Biden and Vice President–elect Kamala Harris from praising her publicly.

“Like me, [Tanden] was raised by a single mother and knows firsthand the importance of having an economy that treats all people with dignity and respect,” Harris tweeted Friday. “I know with her at the helm of the Office of Management and Budget, our budget will fully reflect our values.”

Tanden’s social media activity, which includes bullying, has also sparked controversy. But Biden has said her tweets should not be disqualifying. “That disqualifies almost every Republican senator and 90% of the [Trump] administration,” Biden said in an interview with the New York Times. “But, by the way, she’s smart as hell. Yeah, I think they’re going to pick a couple of people just to fight [over], no matter what.”

Tanden served as an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and many on the left believe that she was behind the movement to end Sanders’ run that year.

Tanden has spent the past four years at the helm of the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, and before that, she worked in the Obama administration on the development of the Affordable Care Act as an adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to Mitch McConnell, wrote on Twitter last week that Tanden would be a “sacrifice to the confirmation gods” and stood no chance of being confirmed.

Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council

Deese is another former Obama economic aide, well known for orchestrating the 2009 bailout of the auto industry. But unlike many of Biden’s other picks, Deese doesn’t have the background of an academic economist and has instead built his career in policymaking.

Under Obama, he served as the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget and the deputy director of the National Economic Council before taking a job at BlackRock as the global head of sustainable investing.

“Brian is among the most tested and accomplished public servants in the country—a trusted voice I can count on to help us end the ongoing economic crisis, build a better economy that deals everybody in, and take on the existential threat of climate change in a way that creates good-paying American jobs,” Biden said.

But once again, the connection to BlackRock has drawn some anger from the more progressive wing of the party.

“BlackRock executives like Brian Deese are responsible for financing environmental devastation while profiteering from Black and Indigenous communities,” Vasudha Desikan, political director of Action Center on Race and the Economy, said in a statement. “There is a deep bench of highly qualified economic policymakers of color who are dedicated public servants without compromised histories in the private sector.”

Still, Biden emphasized Deese’s experience working on environmental issues and said he would focus on reimagining a green economy. Deese has said he’s committed to creating green and “good union” jobs and taking the country further than the Paris Agreement requires."

The COVID-19 Pandemic

Melissa Hawkins, Director of AU’s Public Health Scholars Program

The pandemic response will be the top priority of the new administration. We’ll see a change in tone and a coordinated federal response to the pandemic, both in the short and long term. Biden and Harris have already released a detailed pandemic plan and several polices they plan to implement once they take office. This week Biden announced his COVID-19 advisory board with 13 public health officials, doctors, and current and former government officials.

Beginning in January, I think we’ll see: 1) a massive ramp up in testing capacity, including drive-through diagnostic testing sites with rapid results; 2) an investment in a Public Health Job Corps team to assist with local contact tracing and community-based efforts to protect at-risk populations, including a call for nationwide mask mandate; 3) an increase in production of personal protective equipment (PPE) to assist states, and; 4) support for the CDC to issue clear guidance on how to navigate the pandemic going forward. Biden has also pledged to invest in manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access.

I also think we’ll see the Biden administration double down on investments in the ACA by expanding premium subsidies and creating a public option health insurance program available to individuals of any age. He will rejoin the World Health Organization, and in order to prepare for future pandemics, he will reinstate the National Security Council for Global Health Security and Biodefense.

All of these efforts share the long-term goal of rebuilding trust from general public in science and to repair damage from misinformation, which will take time.

Race and Health Inequities

Jessica Owens-Young, Assistant Professor of Health Studies

Under a Biden-Harris administration, I anticipate more robust conversations and action on a few areas that would affect health and racial health inequities. First, I think the administration is going to shift the narrative of the coronavirus pandemic. They have already begun to do so by announcing and working with their COVID-19 Task Force. I think this team is going to lay a strong foundation to the promotion of more evidence- and science-based practices coupled with social policies that can help support people such as income and housing protections.

Relatedly, I think the Biden-Harris administration will reverse executive orders that are harmful to the environment and seriously consider policy actions to address climate change, beginning with rejoining the Paris Agreement and rescinding executive orders that removed environmental protections, such as limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. Too many Black and Indigenous communities are at greater risk of being exposed to toxic air and water, so addressing climate change and environmental racism may be a priority in this administration.

I also anticipate policies targeting economic inequality and supporting economic growth, both of which impact health outcomes. I do think that this administration will tackle student debt and develop policies to lessen the burden of student loans, perhaps even forgiving at least some portion of federal student loans. From a health perspective, this is important because economic factors influence health and student loan debt can limit health-promoting economic behaviors, like investing in retirement and homeownership. Overall, I can imagine a Biden-Harris administration promoting a more holistic approach to social and economic conditions, which will have a positive impact on health.

The Arts

Ximena Varela, Director of American University’s Arts Management Program

“The future of who we are lies in the arts. It is the expression of our soul.”

-President-elect Joe Biden

During his tenure, President Trump oscillated between ignoring the arts and culture sector, or enacting policies that gutted and decimated its few support structures and safety nets. Starting in 2017, President Trump proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), in a move that would have effectively destroyed major sources of national, regional, and local funding for the arts. And throughout his presidency, Trump engaged in a relentless battle against most of the entertainment industry. With creative industries contributing to $877 billion to the economy every year (with over 5 million people employed), lack of support for the arts translates into lack of support for a substantial part of local and regional economies.

What can we expect from a Biden-Harris administration? Unlike President Obama, President Biden has not articulated an explicit platform for the arts. However, we can look to the records of both President Biden and Vice President Harris for an answer.

Biden was the co-sponsor of the bill creating the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, and one of the original co-sponsors to establish the National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian. His negotiation of the 2009 stimulus bill included $50 million for arts and culture, which was lifesaving for many organizations. And he has consistently voted against the elimination of the NEA, or reduction of its funding, since 1991. Biden’s efforts have not gone unrecognized. In the 2020 election, then-candidate Biden received the endorsement of the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA), only the second time it had endorsed a candidate in its history, because “Biden understands that the arts are a critical driver of healthy and strong local economies in cities and towns across the country” (per Kate Shindle, President of AEA).

Vice President-elect Harris is the co-sponsor of an act to establish Smithsonian National Museum of the American Latino, and of the Confederate Monument Removal Act (the latter with Senator Cory Booker). She has served as a trustee on the board of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and was heavily involved in programs promoting grassroots leadership and diversity in the arts.

The Biden-Harris administration faces unprecedented challenges as they assume office on January 20. But it is clear from their past actions and public statements that they understand the critical role that the arts play not just in the enhancement, but in the very survival and well-being of all Americans.

The Economy

Gabriel Mathy, Assistant Professor of Economics

Biden will immediately provide a better response to the COVID pandemic than the Trump administration, and the pandemic is the main reason the economy is depressed at this time. However, cases are spiking, there is no appetite for lockdowns anymore, so there will be another, larger wave before the vaccine arrives. It’s not clear the President can do much about that.

Biden will have real trouble passing his agenda if the Senate remains in GOP hands, as appears likely. As for Biden’s plans for green investments, a transition away from fossil fuels, rolling back the Trump tax cuts for high income earners and corporations, a $15 minimum wage, a public option, etc. — don’t hold your breath. Congress has the power of the purse after all, and the Senate majority leader can block all these plans if they want to. Executive orders, related to immigration and international trade, will be ways Biden can act.

The likely end of Trump’s restrictions on student visas with Biden will also help with universities like American University, that benefit from foreign enrollment. Higher education is one of America’s most successful “export sectors” and so this will improve the fiscal position of universities and improve economies tied to universities.

Biden will have better economic relations with China as Trump did, and the trade war will ease. However, relations with China will remain frosty. Expect a tech Cold War with competing tech ecosystems tied to China and the United States respectively, with increasing restrictions on apps like TikTok that are based in China in some way.

If a stimulus bill doesn’t pass during the lame duck, then expect a much smaller repeat of the CARES Act, which will provide a boost to household incomes, faster employment growth, and a stronger economy than if no stimulus passes.

It’s possible Biden could pass an infrastructure package with the GOP, especially related to something like high-speed rail. However, expect the GOP to return to supporting austerity as they did during the Obama presidency after blowing up the budget deficit under the Trump administration.

Science

Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience Terry Davidson

Joe Biden emphasized that his administration would “choose science over fiction.” Biden promised to rejoin the 2015 Paris climate agreement, to rely on the advice of scientists and public health experts to combat the global pandemic, to restore the reputations of the Center for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration, and to reverse restrictions that have made the United States a less attractive place for students and researchers from other countries. With his election, scientists throughout the world breathed a sigh of relief. The election has raised our hopes that the ideals of scientific integrity and commitment to fair, evidence-based policies will be embraced once again by the US Government.

However, many of us were astounded that over 70 million voters supported a president who delivered almost daily hammer blows to the credibility of science and repeatedly mocked and rejected the advice of his own science advisers. Without action, the anti-science sentiments fueled by President Trump may well continue long after he leaves office. However, departing from past prohibitions against mixing science and politics, prestigious science-based organizations now argue that to reverse this trend, it is crucial for scientists to publicly stand for evidence-based knowledge and against misinformation. Scientists and scientific policy-makers share this view and recognize that combating anti-science ideologies is an important means to advance the public good. Accordingly, as part of a new initiative at AU’s Center for Neuroscience and Behavior, experts in science, public policy, and law will work together to increase public awareness of the benefits of science and to improve science-based policy-making.

Immigration Law and Enforcement

Ernesto Castañeda, Associate Professor of Sociology

As a candidate, Joe Biden promised to reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) directive. President Obama signed DACA to help Dreamers obtain work permits and temporary relief from deportation. President Trump tried to end the program; however, the courts ruled against the way Trump’s administration tried to phase it out. Biden promised to reinstate DACA, which he has the power to do during his first days in office. Furthermore, Biden could expand it to include both a wider age range of asylum seekers, and also include the unaccompanied minors who were separated from family members after asking for asylum. Additionally, he can assign state resources and build enough political will to reunite these families in the United States as refugees. A first step in this direction would be to terminate the “Remain in Mexico” (Migration Protection Protocols, or MPP) program and allow immigrants to present their asylum cases in the United States.

President-elect Biden and Democratic Congresspeople should immediately start drafting a comprehensive immigration reform bill, although obtaining Republican support will be challenge despite widespread support for immigration reform among citizens. However, the executive branch sets the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. Biden can increase the numbers to make up for the reduction in the acceptance of refugees during the last four years and the many displaced people displaced because of wars and violence. He can immediately end the Muslim ban via executive order. Trump ran on the premise of building a wall with Mexico; Biden should stop all ongoing projects to expand the border fencing. These resources can be better allocated to address the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment, and climate change.

The Environment

Stephen MacAvoy, Professor of Environmental Science

Expect to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. Biden sees human induced climate change as a national security risk, a health risk, an environmental justice issues, and also a chance to invest in more sustainable infrastructure. Biden's stated goal is a net zero CO2 emission and 100% clean energy economy by 2050.

There will likely be a shift in government subsidies from those that incentivize petroleum exploration in favor of some to support clean energy infrastructure. In its purchasing and building, government will likely require increases in efficiency and sustainability.

The United States as a whole is already producing far less CO2 from electrical energy generation than it did in the early 2000's (even with a huge growth in the economy and population). That was largely driven at first by a new focus on natural gas production from the G.W. Bush administration. Now wind energy is cheaper than natural gas, so the trends for renewables should continue for electricity production. Joe Biden has specifically mentioned offshore wind as an area he is keen to see developed. The Biden administration also intends to concentrate more directly on transportation related CO2 (a very tough task) by encouraging the adoption of electrified light and medium vehicles. This would likely take the form of increased infrastructure for electric vehicles as well incentives to consumers.

Immigration

Distinguished Professor of History Alan Kraut

COVID-19 and possible Republican dominance in the Senate make the prospect of swift and comprehensive immigration reform dim, indeed. However, through administrative changes Joe Biden can do much to ameliorate the suffering of immigrants and refugees seeking admission to the United States.

First, he can discontinue all policies that separate children from their parents at our border as a tactic of border enforcement and commit all necessary resources to reunite 545 children now in American custody with deported parents and guardians. Second, he can reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and re-open the program’s application process, bringing hope to young people who were brought to the United States in an unauthorized manner through no fault of their own. Third, Biden can reverse Trump administration plans to dramatically reduce the number of refugees admitted to the United States annually. The Trump administration had slashed the number of refugees admitted by 18% over four years. Fourth, the Biden administration can reverse the public charge rule which allows immigration officials to make an individual’s eligibility for a visa or permanent residency contingent on their not using economic assistance such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits or Medicaid as well as their household income. Fifth, Biden can cease using the current pandemic and public health concerns as a rationale for delaying or denying hearings on asylum claims. Sixth, he can end Trump’s stratagem of demonizing immigrants, especially Muslims and Mexicans, and rescind the order referred to as the “Muslim bans,” excluding immigrants from largely Muslim nations Seventh, the new administration can end Trump’s equating Chinese identity with responsibility for the spread of COVID-19 across the world and discontinue administrative use of expressions such as “Wu Han Virus” or “Kung Fu Flu.” Eighth, the new president can order a review of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for vulnerable populations who are in flight from violence or disaster in their home countries which the previous administration rescinded for hundreds of thousands of refugees without regard for their country’s condition. Ninth, the president can review enforcement strategies at the border and insist that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel adhere to the highest professional standards. Finally, the Biden administration can encourage naturalization and streamline the process whereby legal immigrants can achieve citizenship.

The Arab World

Martyn Oliver, Director of AU’s Arab World Studies Program

The transition to the Biden/Harris administration offers a chance to reset US relations with Arab nations. The question, however, is whether a simple “reset” is of value? Certainly, executive orders eliminating the so-called “Muslim ban” and re-opening of our borders to refugees is immensely important. So too, a posture that shifts from coddling dictators and autocracies towards supporting democracy and freedom is eagerly welcome. At the same time, the current administration has put the lie to certain geopolitical relationships that have emphasized “allies” over principles.

Leaving aside the perennial question of Israel/Palestine or the nearly decade-long tragedy of Syria, what has been and should be the American position towards, say, Egypt and Saudi Arabia? President-elect Biden is a veteran of foreign relations, but the world and its challenges have changed over the last decade, often in ways that have confounded long-term policy positions. If the Biden administration is stymied domestically, I’d encourage a radical and critical rethinking of what it means to support the dignity, agency, and self-determination of the diverse peoples and cultures across North Africa and throughout the Middle East. We perhaps have an opportunity to upend patronizing colonial attitudes or self-serving stratagems and instead support human agency.

Military Policy

David Vine, Professor of Anthropology

Unless concerned citizens demand change, it’s likely no policy area will show greater continuity between the Trump and Biden administrations than foreign/military/war policy. Biden will probably make substantive but relatively small initial changes: ending the ban on transgender military personnel and the Muslim travel ban, accepting larger numbers of refugees, re-joining the Iran nuclear agreement, re-investing in the State Department, and rebuilding relationships with allies by publicly recommitting to NATO and global agreements, such as the Paris Agreement on global warming.

While these would be significant shifts, Biden risks perpetuating 75-year-old post-World War II foreign policy defined by offensive wars and maintaining global military dominance with thousands of overseas military bases and the largest budgets for the production of violence in history. Biden’s military transition team is dominated by the Military Industrial Complex: analysts from hawkish (imperialist) military-contractor-funded think tanks, ex-military officers, and Obama administration officials who perpetuated “endless wars” begun under George W. Bush. The frontrunner to lead the Pentagon supports continued military threats to “contain” China and Russia, which has encouraged both to build up their own militaries and escalated the threat of cataclysmic wars.

The status quo will continue unless concerned citizens and social movements demand a foreign policy focused not on military force but on diplomatic engagement, ending endless wars, preventing new wars, and moving hundreds of billions in military spending into public health and other civilian needs."

As the transition to the next administration under Joe Biden begins, several lists of potential economics team members are already in circulation. Longtime Biden advisors Jared Bernstein and Ben Harris are in the frame. So too is Heather Boushey of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, formerly of Hillary Clinton’s transition team. Lael Brainard at the U.S. Federal Reserve is one of the most experienced technocrats of her generation. She is odds on to be the first woman to serve as U.S. treasury secretary.

These are the intellectual picks. At the other end of the spectrum are operators like the businessman Jeff Zients, Barack Obama’s Mr. Fix-It and the head of his National Economic Council. Zients is one of four co-chairs in the Biden transition team and a “staunch capitalist” vouched for by the Business Roundtable.

The economic agenda of the Biden administration will likely be defined by such splits in personal background and by the wider left-center axis that runs through the Democratic Party. At this stage, these divides seem much more pronounced than under Obama. The economics team of Obama’s early years was taken straight from Bill Clinton’s roster. When Biden’s team announced this year that it was taking advice from Larry Summers, Clinton’s last treasury secretary and a key figure of continuity in the Obama administration, it provoked a storm of protest from the left. Since then, Summers has removed himself from consideration for jobs in the Biden administration.

In truth, whereas the Obama administration inherited a narrative of success from the Clinton era, Obama’s legacy for Biden is more mixed. This reflects the slow recovery from the 2008 crisis; the failure to implement radical reform of the financial system; and the growing awareness of the problems of inequality and structural racism and the challenges of Big Tech, an industry that used to be seen as the salvation of U.S. capitalism. Today, it is no secret that there are huge differences within the Democratic Party on questions of wealth taxes and antitrust regulations, among others.

It is easier to agree on macroeconomics. There is general agreement that the Obama administration would have done better to push for a bigger fiscal stimulus in 2009. Faced with America’s current recession, that is also something on which Biden’s team can agree. The United States needs the largest feasible stimulus to make good on Biden’s promise to “build back better” and kick-start the country’s energy transition.

But getting a multitrillion-dollar package depends on control of the Senate—a prospect that seems likely out of reach for Democrats. If, come January, Mitch McConnell still controls the Senate, that will not only curtail any spending package designed by the Biden White House. It also risks exposing divisions throughout the Democratic camp. Compromise with Senate Republicans will be a bitter pill for the left wing to swallow, and it will force policy to focus on areas such as regulatory change that do not require congressional approval but on which it may be much harder to find agreement within the Democratic Party’s own increasingly diverse coalition."

If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, she will be the first African American and just the fourth woman to lead the CEA in the 74 years of its existence.

As chair, Rouse will play a key role in rebuilding the U.S. economy, which has seen increasing income inequality for decades and has been most recently left crippled by the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the public health crisis began, Rouse has been a strong advocate for providing economic relief to those most affected by the virus.

“We need to be positioned for the economy of the future so that everyone is able to partake in the growth we hope to have,” Rouse said. “To that end, I am honored to have a chance to return to public service to help lead that charge.”

Rouse, a labor economist, previously served in the White House as a member of ​President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. From 1998 to 1999, she worked at the National Economic Council in the Clinton administration as a special assistant to the president.

“I cannot imagine a better choice for the role. Ceci Rouse is a distinguished economist and an outstanding dean for the School,” said Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber. “For more than eight years, she has led the School of Public and International Affairs with integrity and a steadfast commitment to scholarly excellence, diversity, and the free exchange of ideas. The School is stronger and better because of her contributions.”

Rouse’s academic interests focus on the economics of education. She joined Princeton University in 1992 and is the Katzman-​Ernst Professor in Economics and Education and professor of economics and public affairs as well as the founding director of the Princeton Education Research Section​.​ She is the second-longest serving dean in SPIA’s recent history.

Rouse also is a member of the National Academy of Education as well as a senior editor of The Future of Children​, a policy journal published by the SPIA and the Brookings Institution, and a member of the editorial board of the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy. Rouse also serves on the boards of the Council of Foreign Relations, the University of Rhode Island, the Pennington School, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and is an independent director of the T. Rowe Price Funds.

She received her bachelor’s degree and Ph.D., both in economics, from Harvard University.

The Council of Economic Advisers, an agency within the Executive Office of the President, is charged with offering the President objective economic advice on the formulation of both domestic and international economic policy.

Joining Rouse on the Council are members Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey. Bernstein served as chief economist to then-Vice President Biden in the Obama Administration before joining the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he has served as a senior fellow since 2011. Boushey is a long-time economic counselor to President-elect Biden and currently serves as president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonprofit research and grantmaking organization she co-founded in 2013."

Those are the results of a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which finds Biden ahead by 8 points among registered voters, 51 percent to 43 percent, with more than 50 percent of voters disapproving of Trump’s job performance and with Trump holding the advantage on the economy and Biden holding the edge on the coronavirus.

What’s more, the poll shows that close to 90 percent of voters have firmly made up their minds, and that seven-in-10 believe the upcoming debates aren’t that important in deciding their vote.

“So far, despite major upheavals in the country, little has changed,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, whose firm conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.

“In 2020, the fundamentals of our country have been shaken to our core, while the fundamentals of the election have not,” Horwitt added.

Still, the poll finds that 11 percent of all voters are up for grabs, which is greater than Biden’s ballot advantage over Trump.

And Trump’s numbers have inched up in the poll since the summer, while Biden’s favorability rating has also improved in the past month.

“Trump’s summer swoon is over,” said McInturff, the GOP pollster.

The NBC News/WSJ poll — conducted Sept. 13-16 — comes after a turbulent and eventful month of news, including the Democratic and Republican conventions, the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin, some 30,000 more deaths from the coronavirus, the Atlantic report alleging the president disparaged fallen military service members and the coverage of Bob Woodward’s new book on Trump.

But the poll was conducted before the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Sept. 18.

According to the survey, Biden leads Trump, 51 percent to 43 percent, among registered voters — essentially unchanged from Biden’s 9-point lead last month, 50 percent to 41 percent.

Six percent in the current poll say they’re undecided or supporting another candidate.

Biden’s biggest advantages in the poll are among Black voters (he gets support from 90 percent of them to 5 percent for Trump), voters ages 18-34 (60 percent to 31 percent), women (57 percent to 37 percent), whites with college degrees (54 percent to 41 percent), independents (45 percent to 39 percent) and seniors (50 percent to 46 percent).

Trump, meanwhile, has the edge among all white voters (52 percent to 43 percent), men (50 percent to 45 percent) and whites without college degrees (59 percent to 36 percent).

(A separate NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo oversample of Latino voters will be released on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET to gauge where the Latino vote stands in the presidential race.)

And in the combined 12 swing states — Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — Biden is ahead of Trump by 6 points, 51 percent to 45 percent.

The up-for-grabs vote

Nearly 50 percent of all registered voters in the poll say there’s no chance at all they would support Trump in the election, while close to 40 percent of voters say the same of Biden.

That leaves, according to the NBC News/WSJ pollsters, 11 percent who appear to be up for grabs between the two candidates.

These up-for-grabs voters have mostly negative views of both Trump and Biden, and their 2020 preference is divided among Trump (27 percent), Biden (20 percent), neither (27 percent) and not sure (24 percent).

“This does not look like a group that Trump can run the table with, which he needs to do in order to change the race,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.

Similarly, a combined 71 percent of voters say the upcoming presidential debates, which begin on Sept. 29, are not important or are just somewhat important in deciding their vote in the presidential contest.

Just 29 percent say the debates are “extremely” or “quite” important.

Improved numbers for both Trump and Biden

The NBC News/WSJ poll also shows slightly improved numbers for President Trump and Biden.

Forty-five percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance — up from 42 percent in July and 44 percent in August, although that movement is all within the poll’s margin of error.

Fifty-three percent disapprove of the president’s job, which is unchanged from last month.

But only 40 percent approve of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, while 57 percent disapprove — also essentially unchanged from August.

Meanwhile, Biden’s favorability has increased from 39 percent positive, 45 percent negative (-6) last month, to 43 percent positive, 45 percent negative (-2).

That’s compared with Trump’s current rating at 41 percent positive, 52 percent negative (-11).

Last month’s numbers for the president were 40 percent positive, 52 percent negative (-12).

Vice President Mike Pence has a 38 percent positive, 44 percent negative rating (-6), and Democratic running mate Kamala Harris’ rating is 37 percent positive, 38 percent negative (-1).

Trump continues to lead on the economy; Biden holds advantage on coronavirus

On the issues, Trump leads Biden by 10 points on which candidate would better handle the economy, with 48 percent of voters picking the president versus 38 percent picking Biden.

Trump’s lead is 16 points on securing the border and controlling immigration (49 percent to 33 percent), and it’s 9 points on dealing with China (46 percent to 37 percent).

Biden, however, leads on health care (53 percent to 31 percent), the coronavirus (51 percent to 29 percent), race relations (52 percent to 28 percent), protecting immigrant rights (57 percent to 25 percent) and climate change (58 percent to 19 percent).

And on personal characteristics, the poll shows Biden leading on supporting and respecting the military and veterans (47 percent to 42 percent), serving as commander-in-chief (49 percent to 41 percent), being honest and trustworthy (47 percent to 30 percent) and having the ability to bring the country together (52 percent to 28 percent).

Voters are essentially split on which candidate has the necessary mental and physical health to be president, with 41 percent saying Trump is better, and with 38 percent saying Biden is.

Election interest is higher than ever

When it comes to November’s election, 80 percent of voters say they have high level of interest, registering either a “9” or “10” on a 10-point scale in interest.

That is the highest percentage on this question dating back to the 2004 election, suggesting a sky-high turnout.

And there’s no difference by party in election interest, with 83 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans having high interest.

Majority of voters plan to vote early

Finally, a combined 52 percent of voters say they will vote early – either by mail, by early in-person voting or that they’ve already voted.

That’s compared with 42 percent who plan to vote at polling places on Election.

There’s a stark political divide here, with 67 percent of Democrats voting early, versus just 36 percent of Republicans.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted Sept. 13-16 of 1,000 registered voters – more than half of whom were contacted via cell phone – and the overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points."

In campaign speeches, in interviews and on social media, Biden is increasingly evoking an age-old narrative pitting regular Americans against wealthy elites in the hope of connecting with economically anxious voters in battleground states.

And Trump, a former real estate developer from New York who inherited millions from his father, is his foil.

""I've dealt with guys like Donald Trump my whole life, who would look down on us because we didn't have a lot of money or your parents didn't go to college,"" Biden said Monday in a campaign speech in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, a city of 33,000 people north of Milwaukee. ""Guys who think they're better than you. Guys who inherit everything they've ever gotten in their life and squander it.""

Biden's message is an attempt to counter Trump's nativist populism, which blames immigration and globalization for middle-class struggles and proved successful at winning voters in industrial Midwestern states like Wisconsin and Michigan. Former rival-turned-supporter Bernie Sanders had fretted that Biden wasn't doing enough to appeal to those key voters.

Biden is seeking to recapture those historically Democratic states with a counternarrative that says the wealthy and the powerful look down on the working class and have exploited it economically by refusing to pay taxes that help create opportunity.

At a town hall in Moosic, Pennsylvania, hosted by CNN, Biden framed the race last week as ""a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue.""

""We are as good as anybody else,"" Biden said. ""And guys like Trump, who inherited everything and squandered what they inherited, are the people that I've always had a problem with.""

The Trump campaign scoffed at Biden's message.

""Joe Biden may pretend to be 'one of the people' but his radical proposals to increase taxes by $4 trillion and kill millions of energy jobs highlight who he really is, an out of touch career politician,"" Trump spokeswoman Courtney Parella said in an email. ""Through tax cuts, deregulation, and better trade deals, President Trump led our nation into economic prosperity once and voters in hard working communities like Scranton know he is the only leader who can deliver the Great American Comeback.""

As the coronavirus batters an already struggling middle class, the economy looms large over Trump's hopes of winning four more years in office. It's a rare policy topic that voters trust Trump over Biden to handle, which has made some Democrats nervous. Overall, national and battleground polls show Biden as the favorite to win the election.

The two men are headed to a clash at the first presidential debate Tuesday in Ohio, hosted by Chris Wallace of Fox News, who has announced that the economy will be one of six topics.

'Authentic to who Joe Biden is'

With Trump deeply distrusted on handling the coronavirus and health care, Biden advisers see the economy as the last remaining pillar propping up the president, and they are hoping their economic populist pitch will neutralize that advantage.

Where Trump seeks to slash taxes and eliminate rules for businesses, Biden has called for tax increases on corporations and individuals who earn more than $400,000 to fund an expansion of health care coverage, clean energy infrastructure and more as he proposes to ""Build Back Better.""

Former advisers to President Barack Obama said the strategy mirrors Obama's successful pitch in 2012 to portray Republican opponent Mitt Romney as a super-rich corporate predator who looked down on regular Americans.

""It was critical,"" Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager that year, said of the former president's economic message. ""In 2012, it was the linchpin to the race.""

Cutter said Biden's pitch is ""authentic to who Joe Biden is"" as ""the man who grew up in blue-collar America"" and seeks to revitalize those communities. ""Donald Trump ran as the billionaire who would take care of working America. And he hasn't done that,"" she said.

Trump's approval rating on the economy has narrowed from 17 points in February, before the coronavirus pandemic began to claim American lives, to 3.5 points in the RealClearPolitics average.

Still, Trump leads Biden by 48 percent to 38 percent in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll when voters were asked whom they trust more to deal with the economy. That margin has been steady since April, during the early stages of the shutdowns.

Biden has sought to connect the economy's inability to fully reopen to Trump's ""failed response"" and his admission that he tried to downplay the severity of the coronavirus. The president has continued to embrace rosy or unscientific forecasts, last week defending his claim that the virus will ""disappear.""

Jack Kingston, a Trump surrogate and former member of Congress from Georgia, compared the president's optimism about the virus to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's resolve to defeat Adolf Hitler.

""Can you imagine, in World War II, if Roosevelt or Churchill had been saying, 'It looks bad there, I don't know if we're going to do it,' would we have won the war?"" he asked. ""Part of what Trump is doing is — you've got to have the cheerleader out there.""

Trump himself has taken note of Biden's message.

At a rally Tuesday in Pittsburgh, he claimed that Biden ""copied my campaign"" when Biden rolled out a ""Buy American"" manufacturing platform.

And the president reiterated his anti-immigration pitch.

""During the pandemic, I've suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs. As our economy reopens, I want to ensure that Americans are first in line to get the great jobs,"" he said."

But his challenges aren't over.

Biden will inherit a nation still facing down the coronavirus pandemic, economic turmoil as a result of the virus, nationwide unrest because of racial injustice and growing concerns over climate change.

And he’ll be dealing with all of them with Republicans likely still holding control of the Senate.

Here are some of the top issues that Biden will face going into the presidency:

COVID-19

The coronavirus pandemic is far from over. Cases are surging across the nation as many states are in their eighth month of enforcing some sort of social distancing guidelines.

A record 121,888 new COVID-19 infections were tallied across the country Thursday. More than 231,000 people in the United States have died from the virus, and more than 9 million Americans have contracted it.

Joe Biden wins Pennsylvania:Here's how he reclaimed his home state and the 'blue wall'

Throughout the campaign, Biden has laid out some things he would do to combat COVID-19.

He has said he would contact governors to help implement a mask mandate. If they refuse, the former vice president has said he would turn to local officials.

Biden also said he would launch a national plan to expand testing for the virus, implement national guidelines for states to reopen at the guidance of scientists and said the coronavirus vaccine would be free once it’s available.

While experts say at least one vaccine candidate could win FDA approval by year's end, it could be months to get a vaccine to the more than 300 million people who live in the United States, let alone the 7 billion people across the globe.

Now, as president, Biden will have to actually implement his plan rather than discuss what he would do if he were the commander-in-chief.

In pictures:Biden won, a nation reacted. This is what a historic day in the US looked like.

Economy

While Biden will need to address the pandemic, he also will need to address the nation’s economic recovery after it was plunged into a recession as result of the pandemic.

During a speech about his COVID-19 response last month, Biden said that if he were elected, he would give Congress one month to get a bill on his desk that included funding to address the public health and economic aspects of combating the virus.

“I’ll reach out to every governor in every state, red and blue, as well as mayors and local officials, during the transition, to find out what support they need and how much of it they need,” Biden said in his speech in October speech.

He added: “I’ll ask the new Congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of January with all the resources necessary so that both our public health response and our economic response can be seen through to the end.”

Biden has not been specific about what his stimulus plan would look like, but he has said: ""We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open.""

Joe Biden economic plan:What Biden means for the economy, your finances and another COVID-19 stimulus package

Congress earlier this year passed a coronavirus stimulus package that included $1,200 stimulus checks for many Americans. But Congress over the past several months has not been able to pass a new round of legislation.

But Biden has laid out a plan for unemployment benefits, saying he would create a health crisis unemployment initiative to help all workers facing a loss of work because of the pandemic, create plans to ensure unemployment benefits are available to those who lose jobs but would be denied benefits for a variety of reasons, extend COVID-19 crisis unemployment insurance, and provide guaranteed emergency paid sick leave and caregiving leave.

Racial injustice

Biden’s road to the White House was paved by Black voters, in the primary and in the last several days of the election, when many of Biden’s winning votes came from voters in Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee and Atlanta.

But Black Americans, along with white allies and other people of color, continue to protest in the streets nationwide against police-involved shootings and racial injustice.

Biden, who has publicly used the phrase “Black lives matter,” released a plan that includes an array of policies to address systemic racism, which includes investing in Black-owned small businesses, creating a new tax credit to help Black Americans buy homes, and investing in historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

The president-elect will need to address racial tensions across the country in the immediate future, and not just point to his plan.

'A real contrast':How Joe Biden won Democrats and the White House with a message of healing

Stefanie Brown James, who led Obama for America's effort to engage African American leaders and voters in 2012 and co-founder of Collective PAC, told USA TODAY that activists within the movement aren't going to remain silent under a Biden presidency.

She said she expects a number of community tasks forces will be developed by the administration, and they must include ""community leaders from Black Lives Matter and just Black organizations, period.""

""There will continue to be a push of Biden and Harris to make good on their promises,"" she said. ""There's also going to be a larger push for Congress to do the same.""

Climate change

Just one day after the general election, Biden promised that on Day 1 of his presidency, he would rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, a plan signed under the Obama administration to combat climate change.

Activists will likely want to see more than just signing back on to the Paris agreement from the former vice president once he’s in office.

Over the past several months, multiple hurricanes have hit the U.S. and its territories. In addition, fires have ravaged thousands of miles of land on the West Coast.

Young voters and progressives will likely push Biden to support policies such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. Biden does not support the Green New Deal, but he has released his own plan with the goal to get “100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050.”

Progressives, such as Waleed Shahid, communications director of Justice Democrats, said activists are going to want to see Biden pass a big economic stimulus package that includes funding to address systemic racism and climate change.

""Progressive are going to pay really close attention to how bold, how big his stimulus package is, and whether it will move our country toward solving the huge crisis we're going through,"" he said."

Shutting down businesses and paying people for lost wages for four to six weeks could help keep the coronavirus pandemic in check and get the economy on track until a vaccine is approved and distributed, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a coronavirus advisor to President-elect Joe Biden. Osterholm, who serves as director of the Center of Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said earlier this week that the country is headed toward ""Covid hell."" Cases are rising as more people grow tired of wearing masks and social distancing, suffering from so-called ""pandemic fatigue,"" he said Wednesday. Colder weather is also driving people indoors, where the virus can spread more easily.

A nationwide lockdown would drive the number of new cases and hospitalizations down to manageable levels while the world awaits a vaccine, he told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. ""We could pay for a package right now to cover all of the wages, lost wages for individual workers, for losses to small companies, to medium-sized companies or city, state, county governments. We could do all of that,"" he said. ""If we did that, then we could lock down for four to six weeks."" In an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Osterholm clarified his comments, saying ""it was not a recommendation. I have never made this recommendation to Biden's group. We've never talked about it."" ""My only point was if we are going to keep making restrictions state-by-state, there is no compensation for the businesses that are being impacted,"" he added. ""What we're doing right now is not working."" A Biden transition official told NBC News that a shutdown ""is not in line with the president-elect's thinking."" Osterholm was appointed to Biden's 12-member Covid ""advisory board"" on Monday. The panel of advisors is co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith of Yale University. Other task force members include Dr. Atul Gawande, a professor of surgery and health policy at Harvard, and Dr. Rick Bright, the vaccine expert and whistleblower who resigned his post with the Trump administration last month. A representative for Biden did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Osterholm on Wednesday referenced an August op-ed he wrote with Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari in which the two argued for more restrictive and uniform lockdowns across the nation. ""The problem with the March-to-May lockdown was that it was not uniformly stringent across the country. For example, Minnesota deemed 78 percent of its workers essential,"" they wrote in The New York Times. ""To be effective, the lockdown has to be as comprehensive and strict as possible."" On Wednesday, Osterholm said such a lockdown would help the country bring the virus under control, ""like they did in New Zealand and Australia."" Epidemiologists have repeatedly pointed to New Zealand, Australia and parts of Asia that have brought the number of daily new cases to under 10 as an example of how to contain the virus. ""We could really watch ourselves cruising into the vaccine availability in the first and scond quarter of next year while bringing back the economy long before that,"" he said Wednesday.

In 2000, then-Sen. Joe Biden joined with 82 other senators and the Clinton administration in normalizing trade relations with China. It was a crucial step in allowing China to join the World Trade Organization. Labor unions like the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers hated this and mounted a feverish campaign against it. They feared that lowering trade barriers with China would flood the U.S. with cheap Chinese products and kill jobs. But Biden and others argued that it would promote economic growth and peace and help convince China to play by international rules.

Shortly afterward, Biden became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and flew to China for one of his first big diplomacy trips. Standing in front of a group of reporters in Shanghai, Biden declared, ""China is not our enemy. There's nothing inevitable about China and the United States not being as cooperative as other nations.""

Two decades later, Biden, now president-elect, sounds less like he wants to be friends with China and more like he's ready for a new Cold War. During his campaign, Biden called China's leader, Xi Jinping, a ""thug."" He threatened economic sanctions. He wrote in a piece in Foreign Affairs that the U.S. needs ""to get tough with China."" The bipartisan consensus to bind China and America together created one of the most remarkable economic engines the world has ever seen, but there seems to be a growing consensus to dismantle that engine — or, at least, take it to the mechanic for a serious rebuild.

If Biden talked about China in 2020 like he did back in 2000, he might have lost the election. Three-quarters of Americans now have an unfavorable view of the country — up from about a third in the early 2000s. China, which has an economy 12 times larger than it was in 2000, is now a boogeyman. Trade with China may have slashed costs for American consumers and created countless new jobs in various sectors, but — as organized labor warned back in 2000 — it also destroyed huge numbers of blue-collar jobs. Economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson estimate that China's joining the WTO killed about 2.4 million American jobs, including about a million in manufacturing.

And far from becoming a friendlier, more democratic, rule-following nation — which Biden and other American leaders hoped would happen after China was let into the WTO — China has gotten even more despotic. Add in a pandemic that began in its heartland and spread on its watch, and it's easy to see why China's popularity is plummeting, not just in the U.S., but in nations around the world.

The question now is what Biden will do about it. His predecessor levied hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese products and tried to hinder China's technological advances by, for example, forcing tech firms like TikTok to sever ties with a Chinese owner or else close up shop in the U.S. (imperiling Planet Money's pretty awesome TikTok account). But despite the Trump administration's actions, China's rise continues. And they may have even created a U.S. leadership vacuum in Asia that helped China.

Last week, China signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Eight years in the making, RCEP is maybe the world's largest free trade deal in history. It includes China, Japan, South Korea, 10 Southeast Asian countries, New Zealand and Australia — which together account for almost a third of the world's population and economy. While there's a debate about how economically important the deal is, most analysts agree RCEP is a huge geopolitical win for China — solidifying it as the foundation of a regional industrial complex that continues to be one of the world's most powerful economic forces.

The genesis of this deal can be traced back to actions that Biden and the Obama administration took back in the early 2010s. They spearheaded the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was explicitly designed to exclude China and promote American hegemony in Asia. RCEP emerged as a China-friendly alternative. Biden, as vice president, was a major proponent of TPP. ""Our goal is to help tie Asia-Pacific nations together — from India to the Americas — through strong alliances, institutions and partnerships,"" he said in a 2013 speech.

Even back then, Biden and Barack Obama's geopolitical strategy was in tension with a growing trade skepticism in both major political parties. Many saw TPP as another free trade deal that would help multinational corporations at the expense of blue-collar workers, making it unpopular. Even former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opposed the deal as she ran for president in 2016. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of TPP as soon as he assumed office. The other national signatories of TPP continued on anyway and signed it into law. Now some foreign policy folks are arguing that rejoining the trade pact is the easiest way for Biden to counter RCEP and reassert the U.S. in the region. Since he spent years fighting for that strategy, Biden probably still likes that idea. But TPP remains unpopular, especially among labor unions, progressives and Trump supporters.

Asked about RCEP last week, Biden said that America needs to ally with other democracies ""so that we can set the rules of the road."" Otherwise, he said, ""China and others dictate outcomes because they are the only game in town."" He seemed to keep the door open to a TPP-style trade agreement, but he stressed that America would first have to invest in making its workers competitive and bringing labor unions and environmentalists to the table. It was a bit of double-speak, offering bones to both pro- and anti-trade constituencies. He was light on specifics.

With RCEP and about $360 billion worth of Trump's annual tariffs still remaining on Chinese goods, Biden will soon have some big decisions to make. ""I promise you I have a pretty thorough plan, and I will be prepared to announce that to you on Jan. 21,"" Biden said.

President Joe Biden is struggling in the minds of the American public. While his approval rating is down on a slew of issues, his difficulties are perhaps most noticeable on the economy.

Biden now sports the lowest net economic rating of any president at this point through their first term since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977.

In the latest CNN/SSRS poll, Biden comes in with a 44% approval rating to 55% disapproval rating among registered voters on his economic performance. This makes for a -9 point net approval rating. The average of all polls taken in December is quite similar with Biden at -13 points on the economy.

To put that in perspective, the average president at this point in the last 44 years (since we have been polling on the topic) had a net economic approval rating of +5 points. That means Biden’s is 18 points worse than the average.

The best rating, perhaps unsurprisingly, belonged to George W. Bush following the September 11 attacks. He was at +37 points at a time when his approval ratings on all issues were high thanks to the “rally around the flag” effect.

Notably, Biden’s net rating is worse than his two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama in December 2009 and Donald Trump in December 2017. Both Obama and Trump had net approval ratings on the economy of -4 points.

The economy was, by a lot of measures, in deep trouble in December 2009. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was well below average at 72.5. Today, it’s at a similar 70.4. Yet, Biden’s ratings on the economy are considerably worse.

Trump was a different story. Consumer sentiment was at 95.9 in December 2017, but Trump’s overall net approval ratings (-20 points) were so bad that they were dragging down his popularity on a host of issues.

Interestingly, Trump’s problem then is the opposite of Biden’s now. Back in late 2017, most voters were not concentrated on the economy. It was not the nation’s top problem. Ergo, what Americans saw as a relatively stronger economy wasn’t translating into helping Trump.

Today, the economy is viewed as the top problem for both the nation and for people’s families, so the low consumer sentiment is dragging Biden down. A Monmouth University poll released earlier this month found that 41% listed economic concerns (either everyday bills and groceries; inflation; job security and employment; or the economy overall) as the top issue for their family. That’s far more than for any other issue.

Inflation, in particular, seems to be a big issue for Biden. Just 28% of Americans approved of the job he is doing to handle inflation in a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll. This comes as more voters said they were concerned about inflation than any other issue in a December Fox News poll, and only 22% said the Biden’s administration efforts to get inflation and rising prices under control were helping. The plurality (47%) said they were hurting.

Indeed, the issue of inflation hurting a president helps to put Biden’s bad position in perspective. The public reaction now looks at least somewhat similar to how the public was reacting to another president under whom inflation was an issue: Carter.

A lot of Republicans like to draw parallels between Carter (who was a one-term president) and Biden. And at least early on, when it comes to public perceptions of the economy and inflation, there are some similarities between them.

Carter’s economic net approval rating of -8 points in an early January 1978 CBS News/New York Times poll was the lowest around this point in a presidency before Biden’s -13 points. The economy, and particularly inflation, was listed as the nation’s top problem in a late October 1977 Gallup poll.

Importantly, far more Americans (52%) in a November 1977 Time Magazine poll thought that Carter was not making a good start to fighting inflation than thought he was (21%). In other words, Americans felt his efforts were not enough to control inflation.

The good news for Biden is that it’s far from clear what the economy and inflation will look like in the future.

However, President Joe Biden is unlikely to measure his own achievements by the gyrations of the stock market, economic experts say — and that message is likely to resonate with an anxious population.

“I doubt Joe Biden views the stock market as a barometer of his immediate success,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ""He is focused on the health and welfare of Americans. He will gauge success on how much he can flatten the curve, prevent deaths and get the economy back in shape.""

For much of Trump's presidency, it was easy for him to claim credit for stock gains, since he was set up for success, economists say.

“The economy was in pretty good shape. Nothing was really out of balance,” said Dan North, chief economist for North America at Euler Hermes.

Corporate expectations of lower taxes and fewer regulations sent business optimism soaring. “It was the right environment to go up. The Biden stock market has an awful lot going against it,” North said.

The Biden stock market has an awful lot going against it.""

Last March 9 and again on March 12, as the coronavirus began to take over the country, stocks fell so far, so fast, that electronic “circuit breakers” had to be triggered to stave off a full-blown collapse. That weekend, Trump tweeted, “BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY YESTERDAY!” while saying nothing to address, or even acknowledge, the nation’s growing economic fears. The following week, circuit breakers were again triggered on two different days as stocks continued to slide.

The CARES Act, along with aggressive action from the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and add liquidity to the financial system, ultimately stopped the market’s fall. In the ensuing months, Wall Street recovered, while Main Street suffered.

Experts say this is just one example of why it was not only pointless, but foolhardy, for Trump to claim credit for a rising market. “In the investment business, generally speaking, we know that the things that make the stock market move are myriad and complex. It’s difficult, at best, to gauge cause and effect,” Martin said.

Despite his self-professed business acumen, Trump squandered some of the market momentum he was handed, analysts say. “He did quite a few things to really impede the progress of the stock market,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance. “The trade war with China was, by far, the most detrimental.”

That trade war was widely regarded as a failure: It drew to an uneasy truce in early 2020, with little gained for American consumers or businesses.

The new president, on the other hand, faces a heavier lift. “President Trump is handing Biden an economy in shambles, still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak and struggling to avoid a double-dip recession,” Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi wrote in a research note earlier this week.

“Whereas you might say what Trump inherited was a 'normal market,' Joe Biden is inheriting a market that’s at extremes,” Martin said. “You just have a whole new ballgame for Joe Biden.”

Valuations are high, inflation is broadly low but shows pockets of escalation, and market observers say Wall Street seems to be positioned for a best-case scenario regarding Covid-19 containment and immunity. Anything that doesn’t live up to the market’s lofty expectations could trigger a reversal in investor sentiment.

“If you're the average person, do you care if GDP was 3.2 or 3.4 percent? No, you care if you have a job.”

If the market does drop from its current highs, though, economists don’t expect Biden to respond the way his predecessor might have. Unlike Trump, Biden is more likely to focus on containing Covid-19 and getting the sputtering labor market recovery going again. “The Biden administration, I think, is going to focus more on the unemployment rate and jobs and less on what the actual stock market may do,” said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors. “Right now, our immediate problem is still the coronavirus and getting the economy reopened.”

North said: “It’s going to take a long time to get those 10 million jobs back, particularly because there's been so much permanent business closure. That's what I believe the administration will focus on and, honestly, should focus on.""

“If you're the average person, do you care if GDP was 3.2 or 3.4 percent?"" he said. ""No, you care if you have a job.”"

As President Joe Biden takes office, he inherits:

The worst disease outbreak in over a century, which is spreading faster and killing more people in the U.S. than at any time since it began one year ago.

Highly effective vaccines that so far have reached only 4% of the public.

An economy struggling with 10 million jobless and millions more out of the workforce.

A rising tide of murders — up nearly 36% last year in major cities.

Federal debt the highest since World War II, as a percentage of the U.S. economy, and an annual deficit running at $2.3 trillion this year — even before Biden asks for a $1.9 trillion aid package.

More monthly illegal border crossings from Mexico than before Donald Trump took office, despite 453 miles of new or upgraded barriers along the nearly 2,000-mile line.

These are some of the numbers by which the future successes or failures of the new president will be measured.

Analysis

COVID-19

The Disease — Biden takes office exactly one year after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the United States on Jan. 20, 2020.

The virus is still raging out of control, killing thousands more people in the U.S. each day. According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 174,589 new confirmed cases were added yesterday alone, and 2,727 deaths. That brings the total U.S. death toll to more than 401,000.

The U.S. has so far done poorly at controlling the virus compared with other nations. In fact, it leads all other countries in the number of COVID-19 deaths. The U.S. has less than 4.3% of the world’s population but accounts for 19.5% of worldwide COVID-19 fatalities. Relative to size of population, the U.S. death rate from the disease is the 10th highest among the 237 countries tracked by the World Health Organization.

The Vaccines — Two very effective vaccines against the virus that causes COVID-19 were approved for emergency use in the U.S. about a month before Biden took office. Pfizer-BioNTech got its authorization Dec. 11 and Moderna’s came a week later on Dec. 18. Since then at least 13.6 million Americans have gotten one or more shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes 2 million who have received the full two-dose regimen required for maximum effectiveness.

But there’s a long way to go. So far only 4% of the population has received a first shot. Although experts are still studying the question, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimates that half the population needs to be vaccinated “before you start to see an impact” and 75% to 85% need to have the vaccine to achieve the sort of “herd immunity” that makes polio and measles the rarities they are today.

Biden has pledged to give another 100 million shots during his first 100 days. But even if that ambitious goal is achieved, it would still fall far short — as of the end of April — of the levels Fauci says are required to begin slowing the spread of the virus.

There were nearly 257 million U.S. residents aged 18 and over in the U.S. as of July 1, according to the most recent Census estimate. (No vaccine is yet authorized for children under 16.) Since two shots are required, the Biden goal would bring the total fully vaccinated to about 56 million or so, or possibly a few million more if Johnson & Johnson gets emergency authorization for its single-shot vaccine, which is still in phase 3 clinical trials.

Jobs and Unemployment

As Biden takes office the economy is struggling and job growth has stalled.

Employment — After losing 22.1 million jobs in March and April, the economy regained 12.1 million from May through November — but then lost 140,000 jobs in December.

The number of Americans employed in December was 142 million, or 3 million fewer than when Donald Trump became president and 9.8 million below the pre-recession peak in February.

Unemployment — The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% last month — well above the historical norm of 5.6%, which is the median rate for all months since 1948.

The number of people officially listed as unemployed stood at 10.7 million in December, about where it was just over seven years earlier when the nation was recovering from the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

And the rate would be even higher but for the fact that 3.9 million people have stopped looking for work since February and are no longer part of the labor force. The unemployment rate is the percentage of those adults in the labor force who have looked for work in the previous four weeks.

That exodus pushed the labor force participation rate down to 61.5% in December, which is 1.3 percentage points lower than it had been when Trump took over from President Barack Obama. That rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks.

Economic Growth

Biden inherits an economy not yet fully recovered from the deep recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even before the recession, growth was relatively modest — real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product grew 2.2% in 2019, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, down from 3.0% the year before, which was the best year of Trump’s tenure.

But last year’s GDP was almost certainly negative, wiping out all or nearly all of the previous year’s growth.

The first official estimate of 2020’s year-to-year growth is scheduled for release Jan. 28, and there’s wide agreement that it will be negative. Members of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Bank presidents believe the economy shrank in 2020. Their median forecast, issued Dec. 16, was for a 2.4% decline relative to 2019, with estimates ranging from minus 1.0% to minus 3.3%. The more than 60 private sector economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal this month put the 2020 decline on average at 2.5%.

Most (73%) of the 48 economic forecasters surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics said they believe the economy won’t recover to pre-COVID-19 levels until the second half of 2021.

Crime

Biden takes office with murder rates soaring across the nation, in cities, small towns and rural areas alike.

The number of homicides in the U.S. went down 0.7% in 2017 and 5.3% in 2018, then increased 0.3% in 2019 and began to surge early last year.

The FBI announced Sept. 15 that a preliminary report showed a 14.8% increase in the number of homicides during the first six months of last year, compared with the same period the year before.

That murder spike worsened as the year wore on. On Dec. 15, the FBI published, without any press release or news conference, preliminary figures for the first nine months of the year, showing a 20.9% increase in homicides nationwide, compared with the same period in 2019.

The wave of killing swept over cities large and small. Homicides went up 29.3% in cities with 1 million or more in population, 31.1% in cities of under 10,000 and 9.5% in metropolitan counties.

The FBI’s nationwide report for all of 2020 won’t be available for months. However, New Orleans-based data analyst Jeff Asher reports a nearly 36% increase in the number of homicides last year in 58 major cities that publish their crime statistics.

Wages and Inflation

Biden enters office with inflation under control and the buying power of the average weekly paycheck rising.

CPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 1.3% during the 12 months ending in December, continuing a long period of low inflation.

Last year’s figure was held down by a plunge in gasoline prices and the pandemic-triggered economic recession. But CPI rose only 2.3% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2018. The average yearly increase over the past decade is 1.7%.

Wages — For those who still get them, paychecks are growing faster than prices.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 4.7% during the 12 months ending in December — at least for those lucky enough to still be working.

The size of that sharp rise is to some degree a statistical fluke. The 2020 pandemic hit workers in low-wage industries harder than others, pulling up the overall average.

But real wage gains generally have been increasing since hitting a low point in July 2008 at the worst of the Great Recession. They rose 1.2% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018 and inched up 0.1% in 2019, for example.

Poverty — The poverty rate that Biden inherits can’t yet be pinned down. The pandemic recession hurt low-income people more than others, but massive federal aid also was concentrated on offsetting that impact to some extent. The Census Bureau won’t even collect 2020 income and poverty figures until later this year and normally releases them in September, so we’ll have to wait.

Even then the picture may remain clouded. The 2019 statistics were distorted by the pandemic, which hit just as Census survey-takers were trying to collect data. More people than usual failed to respond, and Census researchers later figured that low-income people failed to answer the survey more often than others, pushing up reported income figures and pushing down the number thought to be in poverty. Census researchers wrote that for 2019, “we estimate a poverty rate of 11.1 percent” of the population, or about 36 million people.

Debt and Deficits

Biden inherits the biggest federal debt since World War II, and a treasury hemorrhaging trillions more in each year.

Debt — The amount the federal government has borrowed from the public stood at over $21.6 trillion at last report on Jan. 15. That’s more than 50% higher than it was only four years ago, and growing fast.

The size of the debt in dollars is easily highest in history. It’s also pushing toward a record level when measured against the size of the economy.

The debt at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, stood at 100.1% of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to the 2021 Economic Report of the President, just released Jan. 15. Debt has only been higher than that twice in history, in 1945 (103.9% of GDP) and 1946 (106.1%).

Deficit — Federal spending outpaced revenues by a record $3.1 trillion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. In the current fiscal year the deficit is on a course to hit $2.3 trillion even before Biden has signed a single bill.

Biden plans to make that even larger, saying he will seek a $1.9 trillion package to fight the pandemic and its economic effects. He may not get all of that. His party controls both the House and Senate only by slender margins.

Immigration

The Wall — On his way to Texas on Jan. 12, Trump boasted that his administration had fulfilled his signature 2016 campaign promise and “completed the wall” on the southern border. Once at the border, Trump said he had given Customs and Border Protection “100% of what you wanted.” As we wrote, none of that is accurate.

But the border barrier is still significantly more robust than when Trump took office. In total, 453 miles of “border wall system” was constructed during the Trump administration, according to a CBP status report on Jan. 8. Most of that, 373 miles of it, is replacement for primary or secondary fencing that was dilapidated or of outdated design. In addition, 47 miles of new primary wall and 33 miles of secondary wall have been built in locations where there were no barriers before.

Since the land border itself is 1,954 miles long, according to the US-Mexico International Boundary and Water Commission, the new fencing constructed by Trump covers just over 20% of the southwest border. Together with what existed before Trump took office, there are now about 701 miles of barriers along the southwest border, about 36% of the total border.

Biden inherits funding in place to construct another 234 miles of barriers where none existed before, though the new president has said he does not plan to build any more wall.

According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ estimates reviewed by the Washington Post, there will be about $3.3 billion in unused border barrier funding when Biden takes office. If Biden immediately stops construction as promised, it would cost the U.S. about $700 million to terminate those contracts, saving the U.S. government about $2.6 billion.

Apprehensions — In his speech from the border in Texas on Jan. 12, Trump said illegal crossings have “absolutely plummeted” due to his wall construction.

Border apprehensions spiked in fiscal year 2019, and then fell by about half in fiscal 2020, which ended on Sept. 30. It is impossible to tease out how much of that drop may be as a result of the new barriers constructed under Trump, but a Pew Research Center report documenting the decline attributed it mostly to a worldwide decrease in the movement of migrants due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and governments fully or partially closing their borders as a result.

But apprehensions/expulsions have crept back up in recent months, and so Biden inherits monthly apprehension levels that are higher than what Trump inherited. Southwest border apprehensions and expulsions for October, November and December, the first three months of fiscal year 2021, are higher than the three months before Trump took office.

Political Polarization

Biden, who has promised to reach out to Republicans in an effort to bring the country together, takes office amid a time of significant political polarization.

Most recently, a CNN/SSRS poll released Jan. 17, but conducted between Jan. 9 and 14, shows that 75% of Republicans don’t believe Biden’s election win was legitimate, compared with 1% of Democrats and 31% of independents and others who feel the same way. Just 19% of Republicans polled said Biden won legitimately, compared with 99% of Democrats and 66% of others, including independents.

Also, studies show that the tendency of Democrats and Republicans to dislike and distrust members of the other party has been rising for decades.

As of September 2019, for example, a Pew Research Center survey revealed that the share of Republicans who gave Democrats a “cold” rating, 0-49 on a “feeling thermometer” scale, was up to 83%, 25 percentage points higher than the 58% who did so in December 2016 — not long before Trump was inaugurated. Similarly, the share of Democrats who gave Republicans the same rating had increased to 79%, up from 56% nearly three years earlier.

Furthermore, the same survey found that 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats said that voters in both parties “not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on the basic facts.” Almost half of both parties (53% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats) said the other has almost no good ideas. And when putting politics aside, 61% of Republicans and 54% of Democrats still said members of the opposing party don’t share their same values and goals.

But there was perhaps at least one positive from a Pew preelection survey in October last year: “Majorities of both Trump (86%) and Biden (89%) supporters say that their preferred candidate, if elected, should focus on addressing the needs of all Americans, ‘even if it means disappointing some of his supporters.’”

Editor’s Note: We usually produce a quarterly report called “Trump’s Numbers” in January. But the books aren’t closed on the Trump presidency just yet, so we will do a final accounting later this year.

President Joe Biden said the U.S. economy remains strong after a disappointing jobs report, blaming a retrenchment in hiring on the spread of the delta variant of coronavirus.

“What we’re seeing is an economic recovery that’s durable and strong,” he said Friday, crediting his own policies including a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill earlier this year.

“The measures we’ve taken so far have brought America out of an economic free-fall. We are adding jobs, not losing them,” he said.

The Labor Department reported earlier that U.S. hiring abruptly down-shifted in August with the smallest jobs gain in seven months. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4%.

The increase in nonfarm payrolls fell far short of economists’ forecasts, with gains of just 235,000 jobs as the delta variant caused a resurgence in the U.S. pandemic and employers struggled with persistent hiring challenges.

Adding to Biden’s woes, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin — a key Democratic moderate — on Thursday demanded a “strategic pause” for the president’s economic agenda, imperiling a $3.5 trillion tax and social spending package that his party’s leaders planned to push through Congress this fall.

With a 50-50 split in the Senate, the party’s leaders need all of them to vote for the package to overcome unified Republican opposition.

Biden called on Congress to pass his spending and tax plans “so we can keep up the historic momentum we’ve been building the last seven months. It’s about investing in America’s future, not short-term stimulus.”

He didn’t mention Manchin by name but blamed lobbyists for large corporations and the wealthy for stalling progress on the legislation and vowed to fight them. His plans include tax increases for corporations and families earning more than $400,000 a year.

“I’m going to take them on. We’re going to pass these measures,” he said. “The super wealthy are still going to be able to have their three homes.”

He called for Americans to “stick together” to support the legislation, which he said would reshape the U.S. economy.

“When corporations and the wealthiest start to pay their fair share, it’s going to help millions of people,” he said, who would “punch their ticket to the middle class and stay there.”"

In the near term, without additional federal resources to contain the resurgence of the pandemic and distribute vaccines, the economy will face substantial headwinds. More broadly, millions of households will suffer as a result of waning fiscal support for the unemployed and households and businesses suffering financially. Indeed, Biden’s fiscal package should be judged primarily based on the extent to which it invests in COVID-19 containment and vaccination and provides needed relief to help households and businesses weather the pandemic.

The Biden Administration recently proposed an additional $1.9 trillion in federal spending to address the ongoing pandemic. We estimate that the package would boost economic activity, as measured by the level of real gross domestic product (GDP), by about 4 percent at the end of 2021 and 2 percent at the end of 2022, relative to a projection that assumes no additional fiscal support. We project that if the Biden package were enacted, GDP would reach the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) pre-pandemic GDP projection after the third quarter of 2021, exceeding it by 1 percent in the fourth quarter. In the middle of 2022, GDP would show a temporary and shallow decline and then grow at an annual rate of about 1.5 percent, coming close to the path projected just before the pandemic (see figure 1).

Nonetheless, an analysis of how the fiscal package would affect the overall economy is instructive, although subject to a great deal of uncertainty. In all, with the $1.9 trillion package, we project that cumulative real GDP between 2020 and 2023 would end up close to its pre-pandemic projection; over the next two years households and businesses would make up some of the economic activity foregone during the pandemic. By late 2021, we would likely see the economy operating above its maximum sustainable level. That positive output gap would likely put upward pressure on inflation, which the Federal Reserve has said would be welcome. A risk worth noting is that the return of GDP back to its maximum sustainable level may create a difficult economic period after 2021. While our estimates show a “soft landing,” with a temporary and shallow decline in GDP after the fourth quarter of 2021, the slowdown could be more abrupt and painful than our projections suggest.

Analysis of the Biden Administration Fiscal Package

We divide the $1.9 trillion package into four categories based on who is receiving the money and how likely they are to spend it. (See Table 1 for a more detailed breakdown.)

COVID-19 containment and vaccination, aid to state and local governments, and increased federal spending ($750 billion): this category includes both the direct $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as money for vaccination, testing and tracing, and reopening schools; Direct aid to families ($600 billion): this category includes the $1400 per person rebate checks and the child tax credit expansion; Aid to financially vulnerable households ($400 billion): this category includes the additional $400 per week in unemployment benefits and the extension of the pandemic unemployment programs; and Aid to businesses ($150 billion): this category includes loans and grants to small businesses and paid sick leave.

When recipients of federal aid increase their purchases of goods and services, businesses gear up production and hire more workers than they otherwise would, increasing production and GDP and putting upward pressure on prices. In turn, newly hired workers also increase their spending, which also leads to increases in production and GDP and a further upward pressure on prices. The resulting increase in real (inflation-adjusted) GDP for each initial dollar of spending is referred to as the fiscal multiplier.

The impact on GDP of an additional dollar of federal aid—whether to people, businesses, or state and local governments—depends on how quickly the federal aid is disbursed, how much and how quickly each received dollar is spent (known as the marginal propensity to consume, or MPC), and how large the multiplier is. During a pandemic, the MPCs and the fiscal multiplier, in turn, depend on the extent to which people practice social distancing. Under the assumption that the additional support for COVID-19 containment and vaccination in the package is enacted mitigates the need for social distancing, our expectation is that social distancing attenuates over the next three quarters; by October 2021, it is no longer a factor. In addition, MPCs and the fiscal multiplier are held down to the degree that higher prices dampen demand by recipients of aid, new workers, and businesses.

As discussed in the technical appendix, we choose MPCs based on the literature, attenuating them somewhat to account for the effects of social distancing over the next few quarters. We also attenuate the MPCs to account for recipients’ responses to temporary increases in prices that would result from the increase in scarcity of goods and services and because the saving rate has increased sharply during the pandemic, making households less likely to be liquidity constrained.

We use the range of multipliers the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses when monetary policy is very accommodating to calculate the effects of increased demand on GDP. At the lower end, the multiplier results in an increase in real GDP of $0.50 for every dollar of increase in aggregate demand. At the higher end, the multiplier results in an increase in real GDP of $2.50 for every dollar of increase in aggregate demand. Our estimated results of the $1.9 trillion package reflect a weighted average of those multipliers, with 60 percent weight on the low multiplier and 40 percent weight on the high multiplier. That stems from our judgment that supply constraints will lead more downward pressure on real economic activity from inflation than is typical when the economy responds to fiscal stimulus during periods of very accommodating monetary policy.

Baseline Projection for GDP including December 2020 Package

Under the assumption that no additional fiscal support is enacted, we project that real GDP would grow 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2.5 percent in 2022. That is within the range of projections by economic forecasters. That projection reflects the many factors buffeting the economy. For example, on the one hand, real GDP growth in the near term is boosted by the recent fiscal support package enacted by Congress at the end of 2020, totaling roughly $900 billion. On the other hand, real GDP growth is restrained by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and variants in recent weeks.

The Economic Effects of the Biden Package

Figure 2 shows the breakdown of the effects on GDP by our four categories of aid layered over our baseline projection of real GDP with no additional support. The largest effect stems from the roughly $750 billion for COVID-19 containment and vaccination, aid to state and local governments, and increased federal spending (the dark green region), because of both the magnitude of the federal outlays and our assessment that the MPCs out of this aid are relatively large. The smallest effect stems from the roughly $150 billion for business aid (the dark purple region), because the outlays are relatively small and the effect on GDP per dollar of outlay is relatively modest. As a result of the expected path of federal outlays and the estimated effects of those outlays, the largest boost to GDP is projected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2021.

The estimated effects per dollar of total fiscal outlay for each of the four categories are shown in figure 3. Aid to financially vulnerable households (shown by the light green line) has the largest effect on GDP—boosting it by almost than 10 cents per dollar of aid in the second quarter of 2021, with a peak effect of about 25 cents in the first quarter of 2022. The GDP effect changes over time for several reasons. First, for this category of aid, federal outlays are assumed to be disbursed over a few quarters. Second, we expect that households will spread their spending out over two years, partly in response to an expected temporary increase in prices, with three-quarters of the response in the first year and the remainder in the second. And third, the fiscal multipliers take time to increase production and GDP. From 2021 to 2023, aid to financially vulnerable households is estimated to boost cumulative GDP by about $1.20 (as shown in the inset box).

Aid to businesses (shown by the dark purple line) has the smallest effect on GDP. From 2021 to 2023, aid to businesses is estimated to boost GDP by about 30 cents for each dollar of total fiscal outlay in this category.

The other two categories, COVID containment, aid to state and local governments, and federal spending as well as direct aid to families, have similar effects on GDP, peaking at about 10 cents per dollar of fiscal outlays by the end of 2021, and having cumulative impacts of 70 cents and 80 cents per dollar, respectively, over the 2021 to 2023 period.

Figure 1 (shown above in the introduction) compares the projection of real GDP assuming the $1.9 trillion package is enacted (green dashed line) to a projection of real GDP under CBO’s pre-pandemic January 2020 economic projection (teal dashed line), and under our baseline GDP trajectory that takes current law as given (blue dotted line). With the $1.9 trillion package, we project that real GDP would grow robustly in 2021, contract slightly in the middle of 2022, and then grow modestly in 2023.

Without additional fiscal support, our projection follows the consensus forecast real GDP would remain below the pre-pandemic level for some time. In part, that outcome is a result of the waning fiscal support for distressed people and households under current law. For example, expanded unemployment insurance benefits are set to expire for new recipients in March 2021, long before the labor market is expected to have recovered. In all, cumulative GDP through 2023 without additional fiscal support is about 3 percent below its pre-pandemic projected path. But with the $1.9 trillion package, real GDP reaches its pre-pandemic level by the fourth quarter of 2021, and then exceeds it over the next two years – as households and businesses make up some of the economic activity foregone during the pandemic. Still, cumulative GDP through 2023 remains about 1 percent below its pre-pandemic projected path.

In our assessment, the significant and temporary increase in GDP with the $1.9 trillion would largely be the result of an increase in average hours worked and employment relative to our baseline projection. At its peak, the increase in real GDP over CBO’s pre-pandemic projection would equal about 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022. Our rough assessment is that the unemployment rate would temporarily dip to 3.2 percent, more than 1 percentage point below CBO’s estimate of the natural rate of employment in that period.

The Significant Uncertainty Surrounding this Analysis

The extent of uncertainty underlying our results is significant. First, the path of GDP with no additional fiscal support is hard to predict, as it depends critically on the pace of the vaccine roll-out and the response to the new more contagious COVID-19 variant. Second, the increase in demand in response to the package’s enactment is also highly uncertain. We have incorporated a fairly slow pace of spending out of the federal aid, reflecting the fact that households are flush with savings and state and local government budgets are in much better shape than anticipated last spring. But the pace of spend-out in such unusual circumstances is hard to predict, and it could be faster or slower than we expect.

In addition, we may be overestimating the fiscal multipliers. As we noted above, we have used the range of multipliers CBO uses in a weak economy, when monetary policy is very accommodating. Multipliers in those circumstances are higher because the Federal Reserve is not expected to react to the higher demand or increased inflationary pressures by raising interest rates on risk-free assets. Although the positive output gap we project would likely put upward pressure on inflation, pushing the rate toward and probably above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, the Fed is unlikely to tighten monetary policy given their new flexible average inflation targeting framework. Indeed, the Fed has signaled that faster inflation and inflation temporarily above its 2 percent target would be welcome. Still, greater inflation and higher interest rates faced by private-sector borrowers could result in a larger reduction to fiscal multipliers than we have incorporated. Moreover, a greater share of the increase in demand by U.S. households and businesses could be met by imports than is typically the case, suggesting less of an increase in domestic production of goods and services.

Our GDP projection given enactment of the $1.9 trillion fiscal aid package shows an economy outpacing its pre-pandemic projected path in 2021 and 2022, and then smoothly coming back close to it in 2023. The economy was strong in early 2020 before the pandemic began, with unemployment at just 3.5 percent. At the time, CBO projected that GDP would be just slightly above its projection of potential—the maximum sustainable level of output—through the end of 2023. With enactment of the fiscal aid package, GDP would be projected to be even further above that projection of potential: by about 2 percent at the end of 2021, 1 percent at the end of 2022, and just a touch above at the end of 2023.

With GDP expected to exceed potential output over the course of 2021, we are uncertain whether the landing will be as soft as we project. For example, businesses may misinterpret a temporary increase in demand as a permanent one, leading to overinvestment in the near term and a somewhat sharp contraction in investment when the surge in demand abates. That outcome seems less likely if the surge in GDP is predominantly in sectors of the economy that were suppressed during the pandemic—such as dining, travel, entertainment, and medical services. However, the magnitude of the $1.9 trillion fiscal package may be so large that the increase in demand would be broad, increasing the chances of a somewhat more painful adjustment in economic activity.

Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 recession may have reduced potential output, suggesting an even larger overshooting or, in other words, a larger positive projected gap between GDP and potential output if the package were enacted. For example, as a result of the pandemic and recession, the potential labor force may be smaller if workers have permanently left the labor force or immigration is reduced for some time. In addition, declines in investment in 2020 may have persistently reduced the size of the capital stock. Indeed, in July 2020, CBO lowered its estimate of potential GDP, alluding to some of those factors.

In our view, however, better containment of the pandemic and a stronger economy could to some degree reverse the factors that have dampened potential output. As a result, a comparison of the projected GDP path with enactment of the package and CBO’s projection of potential output in July 2020 would overstate the size of the positive output gap that would result. In our view, if the $1.9 trillion package were enacted in full, the path of potential output would be between CBO’s January 2020 and July 2020 estimates. That would imply that, with the enactment of the package, GDP would be a little over 2 percent above potential output at the end of 2021 and then above by a more modest 1 percent at the end of 2022.

Women and people of color are notoriously underrepresented in economics. Only 14% of full professors are women, and one survey found only 1.6% Black faculty in the economics departments of the 30 highest-ranked universities.

And yet, President Biden has managed to find several highly accomplished economists who are not just women but are also Black, and has placed them in top posts in his administration.

Many of the women are already starting to write a new chapter of U.S. economic history by shaping how the federal government is deploying trillions of dollars as part of the American Rescue Plan — one of the largest deployment of federal dollars into society ever.

Each of the women, to a fault, have backgrounds that reflect their interest in creating an economy that works for more people — especially the vulnerable working class, specifically Black people, Latinos and women — and they are unapologetic in pursuing policies to address these issues.

Some have broken barriers in their work and also in their current roles:

Cecilia Rouse is the first Black leader of the White House Council of Economic Advisers in its 75-year history.

Janet Yellen is the first female U.S. Treasury secretary in 232 years.

Janelle Jones is the first Black woman to be the chief economist at the Department of Labor, which was established in 1913.

The list goes on and on: Angela Hanks is counselor to the labor secretary, Heather Boushey and Martha Gimbel are also at the Council of Economic Advisers, and Joelle Gamble is special assistant to the president for economic policy.

Many of the economists are giants in their fields, and several of them have focused their research on uncovering or understanding systemic failures. Their approach to economics is informed by their own work and personal experience, and collectively they're bringing a sense of urgency and focus on topics that have been ignored for years.

Here's a snapshot of the barrier-breaking economic players in the administration, starting with the newest hire:

Janelle Jones: 'We can't resort back to business as usual'

Jones is among a group of younger economists conversant in the language of social media with sharp tweets that are accompanied with memes. Jones was just named the top economist at the Department of Labor, and in her short time in the role, she is already showing the agency a new style of writing that is peppered with BuzzFeed-style listicle headlines and charts that draw attention.

A former economist at the Economic Policy Institute and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Jones last year coined what she called a new ideology ""Black Women Best."" She called for reorienting thinking by putting Black women first in pulling them out of the recession as a powerful tool to help the economy truly recover.

She said: ""If history has taught us anything, it's that Black people, particularly Black women, are among the last to recover from economic recessions, and the last to reap economic benefits during periods of recovery or growth.""

Her work has attracted attention, particularly at a time when the Black Lives Matter movement has led to a new kind of reckoning.

Last month, Jones wrote: ""Among demographic groups, Black women experienced the steepest drop in labor force participation and have had the slowest job recovery since January 2020. ... We can course correct one of the worst economic downturns in U.S history for all by deliberately improving the economic outcomes of traditionally marginalized groups. We can't resort back to business as usual.""

Cecilia Rouse: The blind auditions by female musicians

Rouse, who now holds one of the most powerful economic positions in the White House, has had a distinguished career in both government and academia, including as dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Her faculty profile says she was drawn to economics because it allows her to address social problems.

Much of her work has centered on examining the forces that have held workers back — whether it's race, gender, poverty or education. Rouse's most famous work looked into why there were so few female musicians in the country's orchestras. She and her co-researchers looked at symphony orchestra hiring records from around the country and their research showed that women were more likely to be hired when they took part in blind auditions.

In her confirmation hearing, Rouse has made her priorities clear: ""As distressing as this pandemic has been, it is also an opportunity to rebuild better ... leaving no one vulnerable to fall through the cracks.""

Janet Yellen: Behind the smile, a radical economist

Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images

At first glance, it would be hard for anyone to call Yellen a radical. Her silver bob cut and ready smile belie a steely determination.

But her work as the first female chair of the Federal Reserve was nothing short of radical.

The Fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and keeping prices stable. But Yellen decided to put her thumb on the scale, by giving more weight to employment. She had already led the Fed to a goal of 2% inflation, breaking ranks with giants like Alan Greenspan, who served as Fed chair from the late 1990s to the 2000s, and who targeted an inflation rate of zero.

In 2014, with the Great Recession in the rearview mirror and the U.S. economy improving, Yellen faced immense pressure to raise rates to keep the economy from overheating. But she saw that the benefit wasn't reaching enough people and too many were still unemployed. So she wasn't keen to tighten the screws and make borrowing more expensive by raising rates.

Yellen even gave a speech in 2015 about her concerns about widening income inequality. In a hearing soon after, Yellen was chastised by several members of Congress for politicizing monetary policy.

Then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney chided: ""You're sticking your nose in places that you have no business to be.""

But Yellen held firm in that testy exchange, and even though she was interrupted several times, she completed her sentence: ""All of my predecessors have talked about large important economic trends and problems affecting the country. ... I am entitled to do the same.""

Yellen also held firm on interest rates and kept them low for years, in hopes that it would encourage more businesses to hire. Yellen prevailed — setting the path for unemployment to hit a 50-year low in the years after — and today, the Federal Reserve continues her approach to monetary policy.

Accepting the Biden nomination as the country's first female Treasury secretary in December, Yellen talked about her roots growing up in what she calls working-class Brooklyn: ""I became an economist because I was concerned about the toll of unemployment on people, families and communities,"" she said. ""And I've spent my career trying to make sure people can work and achieve the dignity and self-worth that comes with it.""

In the path of FDR and Lyndon Johnson?

With the vision of this diverse group of economists driving policy, Biden hopes to secure his legacy and achieve a scale of change that matches huge moments in history.

In his Democratic National Convention speech, the president invoked Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who took office in the Great Depression.

""Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged a New Deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty and fear,"" Biden said. ""FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well. And he did. And so can we.""

FDR is considered one of the most consequential presidents, and it was his responses to the challenges he faced that made him a defining figure in American history.

FDR's New Deal introduced a variety of innovative policies to fix the catastrophic economy he inherited. It expanded the government's role by establishing social programs such as Social Security in a bid to ensure the benefits of the American economy were distributed more equally.

Biden's approach is also reminiscent of Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, and its anti-poverty legislation.

In a sense, Biden's plan is pursuing a Great Society Part II, with game-changing initiatives focused on gender, race, equity and children.

In a departure from existing policy, Biden's plan provides many American parents an allowance of $250 a month for each child and $300 for kids younger than six, and even those with little or no income still qualify for the full amount.

There is also billions of dollars set aside to help Black farmers, who have faced generations of systemic discrimination.

One big critic: Larry Summers

There are plenty of economists who are skeptical. One of the fiercest critics of the brand of economics espoused by the Biden is former Treasury secretary and former Harvard University president and economist Lawrence Summers, who says it comes with big risks.

Summers was himself one of the architects of a relief plan during the last economic crisis, a plan that some would say was underwhelming in size. He had rejected his female colleague and economist Christina Romer's plan of $1.8 trillion that she calculated would be needed to fill the hole left by the financial crisis and its fallout.

Summers also in a 2005 speech famously questioned women's aptitude, leading to much furor.

Today, an entirely different ethos guides the team of overwhelmingly female economists, who have unleashed a set of programs that are rethinking and challenging traditional economics in the hopes of achieving lifting more boats.

Whether they succeed is anyone's guess. And even though Summers said this in conclusion to his speech where he questioned women's aptitude, it could apply broadly: ""I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong.""

110,Biden boosts fuel-economy standards to fight climate change - The Associated Press,Biden boosts fuel-economy standards to fight climate change  The Associated Press,"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NsaW1hdGUtam9lLWJpZGVuLWZ1ZWwtZWNvbm9teS12ZWhpY2xlLW1pbGVhZ2Utc3RhbmRhcmRzLTM0OGJiMzM2ODAzNmViNTA0ZjNiMTM4YTY4MDczOWM30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In a major step to fight climate change, the Biden administration is raising vehicle mileage standards to significantly reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, reversing a Trump-era rollback that loosened fuel efficiency standards.

A final rule issued Monday would raise mileage standards starting in the 2023 model year, reaching a projected industry-wide target of 40 miles per gallon by 2026. The new standard is 25% higher than a rule finalized by the Trump administration last year and 5% higher than a proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency in August.

“We are setting robust and rigorous standards that will aggressively reduce the pollution that is harming people and our planet – and save families money at the same time,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said. He called the rule “a giant step forward” in delivering on President Joe Biden’s climate agenda “while paving the way toward an all-electric, zero-emissions transportation future.″

The move comes a day after Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin delivered a potentially fatal blow to Biden’s $2 trillion social and environmental policy bill, jeopardizing Democrats’ agenda and infuriating the White House. The West Virginia senator said he could not support the sweeping bill, which includes a host of climate proposals, saying it was too expensive and could spark inflation and expand the growing federal debt.

The now-stalled bill includes a $7,500 tax credit to buyers to lower the cost of electric vehicles.

The administration will “continue to fight tirelessly’’ for the EV tax credits and other incentives in the so-called Build Back Better bill, Regan said, but even without them, “we believe that we proposed a rule that is doable, it’s affordable, it’s achievable, and we’re excited about it.’'

The new mileage rules are the most ambitious tailpipe pollution standards ever set for passenger cars and light trucks. The standards raise mileage goals set by the Trump administration that would achieve only 32 miles per gallon in 2026. Biden had set a goal of 38 miles per gallon in August.

The standards also will help expand the market share of zero emissions vehicles, the administration said, with a goal of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles reaching 17% of new vehicles sold in 2026. EVs and plug-in hybrids are expected to have about 7% market share in 2023.

The EPA said the rule would not only slow climate change, but also improve public health by reducing air pollution and lower costs for drivers through improved fuel efficiency.

Biden has set a goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2030 as he pushes a history-making shift in the U.S. from internal combustion engines to battery-powered vehicles.

He has urged that components needed to make that sweeping change — from batteries to semiconductors — be made in the United States, too, aiming for both industry and union support for the environmental effort, with the promise of new jobs and billions in federal electric vehicle investments.

While ambitious, the new standards provide adequate lead time for auto manufacturers to comply at reasonable costs, the administration said. EPA’s analysis shows the industry can comply with the final standards with modest increases in the numbers of electric vehicles entering the fleet.

Environmental and public health groups mostly hailed the new rules, while the trade association representing most major automakers reacted cautiously.

Automakers are “committed to achieving a cleaner, safer, and smarter future,’' but EPA’s final rule for greenhouse gas emissions is more aggressive than originally proposed, “requiring a substantial increase in electric vehicle sales, well above the 4% of all light-duty sales today,’' said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. The group represents manufacturers producing nearly 99% of new cars and light trucks sold in the U.S.

“Achieving the goals of this final rule will undoubtedly require enactment of supportive governmental policies – including consumer incentives ... and support for U.S. manufacturing and supply chain development,’' Bozella said in a statement.

“We can all breathe a collective sigh of relief now that a strong federal clean car rule is restored,’' said Morgan Folger of Environment America, an advocacy group.

Despite pushback from the auto industry, the rule will significantly reduce air and climate pollution, Folger said. She called the announcement “a win” on climate that will help create “an onramp to a future with zero emissions from our cars and trucks.’'

EPA’s action is “an important step forward that will reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution and improve lung health,’' added Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association.

EPA called the new rule critical to address climate change. Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, making up 29% of all emissions. Within the transportation sector, passenger cars and trucks are the largest contributor, accounting for 58% of all transportation-related emissions and 17% of overall U.S. carbon emissions.

The final standards will contribute toward a goal set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement to keep the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the EPA said. The U.S. rejoined the Paris agreement on Biden’s first day in office after former President Donald Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the global pact.

The new rules would begin with the 2023 car model year and increase emissions reductions year by year through model year 2026. The rule accelerates the rate of emissions reductions to between 5 and 10% each year from 2023 through 2026, the EPA said, far higher than under previous rules."

(AP) — President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion coronavirus plan Thursday to end “a crisis of deep human suffering” by speeding up vaccines and pumping out financial help to those struggling with the pandemic’s prolonged economic fallout.

Called the “American Rescue Plan,” the legislative proposal would meet Biden’s goal of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration, and advance his objective of reopening most schools by the spring. On a parallel track, it delivers another round of aid to stabilize the economy while the public health effort seeks the upper hand on the pandemic.

“We not only have an economic imperative to act now — I believe we have a moral obligation,” Biden said in a nationwide address. At the same time, he acknowledged that his plan “does not come cheaply.”

Biden proposed $1,400 checks for most Americans, which on top of $600 provided in the most recent COVID-19 bill would bring the total to the $2,000 that Biden has called for. It would also extend a temporary boost in unemployment benefits and a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures through September.

And it shoehorns in long-term Democratic policy aims such as increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expanding paid leave for workers, and increasing tax credits for families with children. The last item would make it easier for women to go back to work, which in turn would help the economy recover.

The political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it after Biden takes office next Wednesday. But Democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of Congress, and Republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.

“Remember that a bipartisan $900 billion #COVID19 relief bill became law just 18 days ago,” tweeted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. But Biden says that was only a down payment, and he promised more major legislation next month, focused on rebuilding the economy.

“The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight, and there’s not time to waste,” Biden said. “We have to act and we have to act now.”

Still, he sought to manage expectations. “We’re better equipped to do this than any nation in the world,” he said. “But even with all these small steps, it’s going to take time.”

His relief bill would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. Aides said Biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. Interest rates are low, making debt more manageable.

Biden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus.

That squares with the judgment of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business lobbying group and traditionally an adversary of Democrats. “We must defeat COVID before we can restore our economy and that requires turbocharging our vaccination efforts,” the Chamber said in a statement Thursday night that welcomed Biden’s plan but stopped short of endorsing it.

The plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic’s most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 385,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. And government numbers out Thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.

Under Biden’s multipronged strategy, about $400 billion would go directly to combating the pandemic, while the rest is focused on economic relief and aid to states and localities.

About $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.

With the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration delivered two highly effective vaccines and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation’s vaccination campaign is off to a slow start with about 11 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 30 million doses have been delivered.

Biden called the vaccine rollout “a dismal failure so far” and said he would provide more details about his vaccination campaign on Friday.

The plan also provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration’s first 100 days. About $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.

The plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers, to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus.

There’s also a proposal to boost investment in genetic sequencing, to help track new virus strains including the more contagious variants identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa.

Throughout the plan, there’s a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments, aides said.

With the new proposals comes a call to redouble efforts on the basics.

Biden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. It’s still the surest way to slow the COVID-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on Tuesday.

Biden’s biggest challenge will be to “win the hearts and minds of the American people to follow his lead,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.

The pace of vaccination in the U.S. is approaching 1 million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or “herd” immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the American Hospital Association. Wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to 3 million a day.

Biden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.

It’s still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it’s particularly a problem among Black Americans.

“We will have to move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated,” Biden said.

Next Wednesday, when Biden is sworn in as president, marks the anniversary of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States.

The federal government didn’t act aggressively enough in 2009 to fight the Great Recession. And the economic recovery was weaker as a result.

Joe Biden, as former President Obama’s vice president, learned that painful lesson firsthand. That’s why Biden is taking a go-big, or go-home approach now that he’s inheriting a fragile economy and the worst pandemic in a century.

Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan shows that he’s determined to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Great Recession – if Congress lets him.

“If we look back and think this plan was too big, that would be a regret that would be fine to live with,” Jason Furman, one of the architects of the 2009 stimulus plan, told CNN Business.

Furman, a former top economic aide to Obama, recalled that the team wanted a $1 trillion stimulus package in 2009 – or roughly 25% bigger than the record-setting legislation that ultimately got through Congress.

Let’s address the crisis right in front of us. Get growth going in the economy, which is the best way to pay down that debt.” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon

“The recovery was slower from the financial crisis because the stimulus wasn’t bigger,” said Furman, who served as one of Obama’s top economic advisers.

By contrast, economists say the Biden plan should help the US economy ride out the next six months or so of the pandemic, which has killed more than 400,000 Americans.

Mark Zandi: 8% GDP growth if enacted

The $1.9 trillion plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks, a $15 federal minimum wage, $350 billion in state and local aid, enhanced unemployment benefits, help for the hungry and $25 billion in rental assistance.

The goal would be to help Americans in need, especially those whose livelihoods are linked to industries crushed by the pandemic like restaurants, hotels, airlines and cruise lines. The United States lost jobs in December for the first time since the spring. The nation is still down 10 million jobs during the pandemic.

Crucially, Biden is proposing spending big, for the first time during this pandemic, on the health crisis itself. His plan calls for $400 billion to keep schools open, speed up vaccinations and improve testing.

“One of the lessons of 2009 was that the argument that you could start modestly and then keep adding if the economy did not improve ran into a political reality,” Austan Goolsbee, a former Obama economic adviser, told CNN Business. “President-elect Biden was there. You can already see they’re not going to repeat that scenario.”

If enacted – and that’s a huge if – the US economy would grow by a sizzling 8% in 2021 and the job market would return to nearly full employment by the fall of 2022, according to projections by Mark Zandi, chief economists at Moody’s Analytics.

However, Biden’s stimulus plan will face opposition in Congress. Zandi expects Biden’s American Rescue Plan will get whittled down to just $750 billion. That in turn would leave US GDP growth at about 5%.

Goldman Sachs is a bit more optimistic. After Biden released his plan, the Wall Street bank raised its estimate of fiscal relief from $750 billion to $1.1 trillion. And Goldman Sachs now expects US GDP growth of 6.6% this year, up from 5.9% before Democrats took control of the US Senate.

Janet Yellen: Act big now

One vexing problem for Biden is how to convince lawmakers – and the public – to add to America’s $27 trillion pile of debt. Republicans cast aside their debt concerns to pass the Trump tax cuts and bipartisan spending surges, but deficit hawks are going to make their voices heard again – as they did during the Obama era.

There’s no doubt that the United States faces an unsustainable fiscal situation. But the Biden team is arguing now is not the time to worry about the debt.

Janet Yellen, Biden’s nominee for Treasury secretary, also knows the firsthand the risk of Congress failing to forcefully address a crisis. Yellen led the Fed at a time when it was under enormous pressure to boost the sluggish recovery from the Great Recession.

“With interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,” Yellen told lawmakers Tuesday. “In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs.”

Yellen also emphasized that inequality is a serious problem that must be addressed by bold government policy.

“Well before Covid-19 infected a single American, we were living in a K-shaped economy,” Yellen said, “one where wealth built on wealth while working families fell further and further behind. This is especially true for people of color.”

Some business leaders agree with the need to think big now.

Asked by CNN Business about the national debt, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged Tuesday that politicians must address the budget, but not until the pandemic passes.

“Let’s address the crisis right in front of us. Get growth going in the economy, which is the best way to pay down that debt,” McMillon, chairman of the Business Roundtable, said during a call with reporters.

Biden remembers the last debt debate

Others fear the United States is moving too quickly given that Congress just enacted a $900 billion relief package last month.

“I do think they’re doing too much. At some point, it becomes irresponsible,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel.

Piegza described the surging US debt-to-GDP as “alarming” and called for a “smaller, more targeted approach.”

Furman, the former Obama adviser, agreed that Biden’s proposed stimulus checks “could be more targeted.” He suggested a lower income cutoff before Americans would receive the full $1,400.

However, Furman dismissed concerns about the US debt because the federal government’s interest payments are low and falling due to historically cheap borrowing costs. Even the International Monetary Fund, which traditionally emphasizes concerns about debt, is telling countries to be ambitious.

Recall that deficit concerns, along with the rise of the Tea Party, caused the United States to cut spending during Obama’s first term, long before the economy had healed from the Great Recession.

At the time, the Tea Party was threatening to make the United States default on its debt. And Biden helped lead those tense budget negotiations with Congress.

“The premature shift to austerity certainly slowed the economic recovery,” Furman said. “For a lot of people, that lesson has been learned.”"

It may be years before Americans are driving over new bridges or plugging their electric vehicles into a new highway charger funded by President Joe Biden’s infrastructure package. But some of the money could be released over the next six months, providing a jolt to a backlog of projects across the country.

After months of debate, Congress passed the historic infrastructure package late last week. Once signed into law, it will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments into America’s infrastructure over five years. Funding for highways and roads, bridges, rail, the power grid, water systems, airports, broadband and public transit will get a big boost.

Biden touts that the spending will grow the economy and create jobs. While many economists agree, it could be months before Americans see the real effects – unlike the federal coronavirus pandemic relief that delivered money directly to their pockets within weeks.

Money could be released within six months

Most of the funding will pass through the US Department of Transportation and either will be awarded to states annually based on a formula or disbursed through a competitive grant program.

This year’s formula funding will go out within the next six months, and the application process will open for some of the grant programs during the same period, Transportation Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg said at a news conference Tuesday.

“The good news is we know that local transportation agencies have a lot of projects and are ready to start investing the money right away,” Trottenberg said, adding, “but we want to be careful on setting expectations.”

RELATED: Here’s how Biden’s infrastructure plan would impact key areas of American life

The bigger projects, like rail, will take more time and planning. The department is also planning on hiring more staff to help stand up the new grant programs.

But now that states and localities know the money is coming, they could start laying out their plans.

Over the weekend, Biden said people could start seeing the effects “within the next two to three months,” noting that it will begin with “people being told they’re going to be working … and things are going to move.”

What gets funded first

Money moving through the existing formula fund programs is expected to get out the door quickest. A lot of those funds will go to state departments of transportation for highway maintenance and repair. States will be getting roughly one-third more in formula highway funding than the year before.

“We could see a lot more contracts going out next year in advance of spring construction,” said Jeff Davis, senior fellow at the nonprofit Eno Center for Transportation.

States are also expected to quickly receive formula funding for transit projects and bridges. Money for airports and Amtrak could also be handed over soon, Davis said.

The funding for electric vehicle chargers will also be distributed through a formula, but it’s a new program that the Department of Transportation will have to design first.

Grant programs will take more time

The timing is unclear for the more than $100 billion that will be allocated through competitive grant programs. The Department of Transportation will have to set the criteria, then solicit and review applications from state and local governments before announcing the awards.

“The competitive grants will probably be the slowest to come out,” said Susan Howard, program director of transportation finance at the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

“It will be a real heavy lift for DOT to get this level of discretionary funding out the door,” she added.

The Department of Transportation will set the criteria for the new funding, making sure the money goes to projects that help meet the Biden administration’s goals of combating climate change and advancing equitable access to transportation.

For years, existing federal grant programs for road, rail, transit and port projects have not had enough money to meet demand. Last year, applications received for the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program, known as INFRA, collectively requested $6.8 billion, more than seven times the funding available.

“Those programs are significantly oversubscribed. I expect a lot of those applicants to tweak their applications and resubmit for the new funding,” said Elaine Nessle, executive director of the Coalition for America’s Gateways and Trade Corridors.

Projects that may already have some preliminary engineering work done and environmental permits secured may be some of the first to put the money to use, she added.

Economic impact

The investments are likely to have more of a long-term impact on job creation than an immediate boom since the labor market is already tight.

“Infrastructure spending has a bigger effect on jobs when we’re in an economic recession,” said Jon Huntley, senior economist for the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

“The benefits of infrastructure spending take a while, but are very, very long lasting,” he added.

Over the long run, the improved highways and bridges, as well as the investment in a stronger broadband network, could make workers more efficient and smooth out friction points in the supply chain.

A Moody’s Analytics report found that the infrastructure spending will create more than 800,000 jobs by the middle of the decade.

Similarly, S&P Global found that a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure would lead to 883,600 new jobs by 2030.

Huntley noted that he doesn’t expect the spending package to increase inflation because of the time it will take for the money to be released.

While the legislation includes a multitude of measures to pay for the spending – without raising taxes – it is expected to add $256 billion to the federal budget deficit over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office."

Biden has said that he supports the workers' right to strike but that he is ""not going to get into the negotiation,"" and White House officials say he doesn't plan to get involved in any of the labor disputes involving more than 100,000 workers across the country. Instead, he has taken the position that the decision to strike is up to the workers, leaving it to them and their employers to resolve disputes, the officials said.

It's a shift for Biden. As a presidential candidate and a senator, Biden joined picket lines and tweeted out support for striking workers. He has called himself the most pro-labor president in history, having come out in support of Amazon workers trying to unionize and repeatedly inviting labor leaders to the White House.

But President Biden faces a different dynamic from candidate Biden, because strikes risk adding to labor shortages and supply chain disruptions that are already driving up prices as the global economy reels from pandemic strains. While the strikes could benefit workers by driving up wages in the long term, the near-term impact of persistent or growing work stoppages could include worst-case scenarios like food shortages or lack of access to hospitals.

""This will come at an economic cost to employers and therefore the economy, and I think that may be why Biden has gone a little silent,"" said Ariel Avgar, an associate professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell University. ""It is tricky for him. On the one hand, he is on the record supporting unions and their ability to use collective action. On the other hand, the point of strikes is to extract an economic price for employers unwilling to negotiate in a way the union feels is appropriate.""

There have been 184 strikes by health care to factory workers this year after the coronavirus pandemic aggravated concerns over low wages and poor working conditions, and the tight labor market has given workers more leverage. Among the strikers are more than 10,000 John Deere workers who went on strike this month. More than 24,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente are preparing to strike, joining thousands of nurses and other health care workers elsewhere who have been striking for months.

Biden made his only comments about what has been dubbed Striketober in response to a reporter's questions last week.

""They have a right to strike, and they have a right to demand higher wages, and the companies they're striking on are doing very well,"" Biden said. ""I'm not going to get into the negotiation, but my message is: If you think that's what you need, then you should do it.""

A White House official said that Biden has spoken extensively about his support for unions and collective bargaining and that he believes ""workers have a right to strike and government's job is to defend that right."" Press secretary Jen Psaki framed the strikes as a positive sign for the economy when she was asked about them last week.

The message stops short, however, of specifically supporting the workers who are on strike, which Biden could do without getting directly involved in any negotiations.

""A statement that the president supports the right isn't much in and of itself, because the right is already there in law. It would be a bolder statement that he supports workers on strike,"" said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary during the Clinton administration. ""He could come out with a statement saying many of these workers have been crucial during the pandemic, essential workers, the nurses, they are all entitled to better pay and better working conditions.""

Some of those on the front lines have been eager for Biden and his administration to take a more active role. David Schildmeier, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Nurses Association, said he is being asked almost every day by nurses striking outside Saint Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, why Biden hasn't given his support or whether Vice President Kamala Harris would be willing to come to the picket line.

Marlena Pellegrino, who has worked at the hospital for 35 years, and 700 other Saint Vincent nurses have been picketing for more than eight months. Many of them have lost their health insurance benefits and are starting to look for other work. The nurses initially began striking to improve staffing levels, but the issue has turned to whether they will be allowed to return to their jobs once the strike is over, Pellegrino said.

""It is time for someone to step up,"" she said. ""We would absolutely love and implore the president to get involved. There hasn't been any direct involvement at that level.""

While Biden has yet to get directly involved in any of the strikes, some of his top officials have, both publicly and behind the scenes. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh has been in contact with the striking nurses at Saint Vincent hospital, in his home state, and made calls on their behalf, Schildmeier said. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined striking John Deere employees on the picket line in his state, Iowa, on Wednesday.

""These folks were very supportive of me when I ran for governor, and it's something that you don't forget, especially when you're behind and not many people had that faith and confidence in you,"" Vilsack told the John Deere workers. ""You remember the people that did. When they need somebody to give them a pat on the back, I want to be here for them.""

Biden's nominee to be chief labor mediator, Javier Ramirez, whose task it is to help resolve and prevent disputes, has contacted officials with Kaiser Permanente and the union weighing a strike against it, said Maureen Anderson, the chief of staff for the Alliance of Healthcare Unions, which is representing the Kaiser workers.

While not specifically addressing the strikes, Harris and Walsh met Wednesday with federal workers and announced administration policies to help inform workers of their rights to organize as part of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment.

There are some actions a president can take to resolve a strike, such as forcing both sides back to the negotiating table under laws allowing presidents to intervene in airline or railway strikes or when a strike reaches the level of a national emergency that jeopardizes health and safety.

The moves are often seen as hindering workers' rights, and they usually require a strike to have larger economic consequences beyond a single industry or region. But presidents can show their support for a particular movement, which Avgar of Cornell said he is surprised he hasn't seen from Biden, given his strong support for unions in the past.

""It isn't surprising politically to try to walk a fine line"" when it comes to supporting the labor movement, he said. ""But not coming out with the full-throated support he did previously is surprising.""

Pellegrino said she has seen the power national figures can have in resolving strikes. The last time the Saint Vincent nurses went on strike, Sen. Ted Kennedy stepped in and brokered a deal. Ultimately, an agreement was reached in Kennedy's Senate office with the two sides in separate rooms and Kennedy and his staff mediating.

""We are fighting corporate America, just the 700 of us, and that is not a lot of people. It feels like David and Goliath,"" she said. ""We are feeling the onus on our shoulders, and we are carrying this weight. It is very overwhelming."""

President Biden is out on the road this week promoting a massive infrastructure plan to Americans. Biden, who campaigned in 2020 as the country reeled from pandemic, promising those worried about the future that he’d “Build Back Better,” unveiled his $2.3 trillion proposal on March 31.

Biden has suggested that the initiative could be financed largely though increases in taxes on corporations and wealthier Americans, an idea that has been roundly criticized by Republicans. It has also rankled some centrist Democrats, who say it is too expensive and contains elements that far exceed what historically has been understood as infrastructure. (One senior GOP senator has suggested his party might be willing to support a smaller $900 million package.) Overall, however, Harvard analysts who specialize in infrastructure policy, budgeting, and finance, as well as economics, welcome Biden’s initiative.

The plan calls for spending on highway and bridge repairs, improved public transportation, upgrades to the freight railroad system and Amtrak, and modernizing airports and commercial seaports. It also seeks to remove of all lead water pipes in the country; overhaul the energy grid, stormwater, and sewer systems to address climate change and resiliency; and expand clean energy technologies. In addition, it would allot billions to expand broadband; build affordable housing, child-care facilities, and schools (and upgrade existing ones); energy retrofit existing lower- and middle-class homes; and increase access to home care for the elderly and disabled.

Linda Bilmes, Daniel Patrick Moynihan Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), an expert on public budgeting and finance, said the initiative would be a “generational” investment in the nation’s infrastructure and the largest single package since the 1960s.

“As a country, we have really underinvested in our infrastructure defined broadly, and that includes the human capital,” she said.

The emphasis on sustainability and climate change resiliency is an expansion of the term “infrastructure,” as plan critics complain, but the correct one, she noted.

“Right now, every dollar that we spend reconstructing something that’s just going to be flooded away again is a dollar wasted,” said Bilmes. “What we need is an infrastructure that is sustainable. So, it is a redefinition, but it’s absolutely the right redefinition.”

Now that Biden’s plan is on the table, the political battle over it has begun. If approved by Congress, funds would be distributed to states over eight years, or two presidential terms, instead of the usual 10 years. To finance the proposal, the administration has proposed a partial rollback of some tax breaks signed into law in 2017 by President Donald Trump, pushing tax rates on corporations from 21 percent to 28 percent, and raising rates on individual incomes over $400,000 and capital gains for the next 15 years.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said not a single Republican will support what he called Biden’s “grab bag” plan, citing newly revived worries over the national debt. Party leaders have seized on Biden’s tax proposal as a flaw even though polls show nearly two-thirds of Americans approve of raising the corporate rate to fund infrastructure. Nevertheless, Biden has quietly held talks with some Republican lawmakers in recent weeks, according to news reports, saying he’s open to negotiation “if possible.”

But even some Democrats, notably Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have questioned such a large spending bill and the wisdom of apportioning more than half the money to things other than roads, bridges, and utility systems — including $400 billion for more home medical care for seniors and the disabled, $213 billon for affordable housing, $174 billion to build charging stations for electric vehicles, $100 billion to expand high-speed broadband nationwide; $100 billion for public schools; and $25 billion for child-care facilities. They have asked that these items be moved into a separate bill. With a 50/50 Senate and Democrats currently holding only a seven-seat majority in the House, Biden can ill afford to ignore the opinions of potential naysayers.

With interest rates for government borrowing still near zero percent, and the strong track record infrastructure spending has as an “investment multiplier,” financing an infrastructure package is smart and relatively risk-free, said Bilmes. Raising capital gains and income taxes would create a protracted battle on Capitol Hill that would eat up valuable time and political capital for the Biden administration.

While hiking gas and carbon taxes “should be” part of the plan’s financing equation, she said, those moves are highly unlikely since Congress hasn’t raised the federal gas tax since 1993 because of its broad unpopularity.

Jason Furman ’92, Aetna Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy jointly at HKS and the Department of Economics at Harvard, said the government could borrow about $2 trillion “without causing a whole lot of problems” to the U.S. economy.

“My own advice would be: It’d be nice to pay for it; it’d be nice to reform the tax system and have a more progressive tax system,” said Furman, who advised President Barack Obama and was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during his administration. “But if you can’t do that now, do the infrastructure now and then come back at some point and do the taxes. I don’t think they need to be passed at the same time.”

Spending on infrastructure “makes a lot of sense right now” for several reasons, said Furman.

First, spending would be spread out over an eight-year period. “Normally, in a crisis, that’s a problem. Now, it’s actually good because we have tons of money coming into the economy in 2021 from the American Rescue Plan. We don’t need any more money,” he said.

“The second thing is interest rates remain really low. They’ve risen a lot, but they’re still much lower than they’ve been at almost any time in the past. And then finally, [infrastructure spending] will help, over time, the supply side of the economy so we can produce better as a country,” said Furman.

Worries over adding $2 trillion more to the national debt, while not supported by the economic reality, can’t be dismissed as pure politics either, Furman said.

“If somebody came along and said they wanted to do $10 trillion dollars, that would create a problem, or even $1 trillion that was badly designed and badly done, that would use up some of the finite amount of space we have left,” said Furman. “But we do have space left, and we should use it wisely.”

Whether the money is used wisely will be key to the success or failure. The states, not Congress or the president, decide where most infrastructure funds appropriated by the federal government get spent.

“It’s not possible for the federal government to micromanage where every dollar is going to go,” so having broad guidelines for how it should be used, and very comprehensive, robust oversight to make sure it is, will be essential, said Bilmes.

Wasteful spending can be greatly reduced if the plan follows a few key principles, said Stephen Goldsmith, Derek Bok Professor of the Practice of Urban Policy and director of the Innovations in American Government Program at HKS, who studies “smart city” technology.

“One is that every layer of bureaucracy that we go through increases expense and delays application. So to the extent that, at least for our larger cities, the money can go [directly] to the cities and the regions” rather than to “state departments, I think that’s better — better for political reasons, better for effectiveness reasons, better for speed reasons,” Goldsmith said in a recent interview with the Ash Center.

Incentivizing project bidders to come up with new and better ways to do things so that the work lasts longer and yields better results, and speeding up the environmental regulatory process so extra money and time aren’t wasted during reviews of standard permission requests, will also help, he said.

The business and investing communities welcome the federal government finally making good on long-deferred infrastructure promises. A 2017 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers, which regularly examines the quality of U.S. infrastructure, noted that almost $4 trillion in Gross Domestic Product would be lost from the economy if the U.S. did not close the $2 trillion infrastructure gap by 2025.

But many business leaders and investors still have a lot of questions about Biden’s proposal, said John D. Macomber, senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, who teaches infrastructure finance.

“One is, where’s all the capital coming from? The second is, [who will be] doing the work, and the third is, how does the economy benefit?” he said.

By trying to address so many disparate concerns at once, the plan’s primary objective is unclear, said Macomber. Is it to stimulate the economy or to get people back to work across the country, or just in the hardest-hit regions? Is it to boost U.S. competitiveness on the world stage? Improve citizens’ everyday quality of life? To help cities recover from COVID losses to things like public transportation?

“Those are really different objectives,” he said. “I’d rather see some consensus in those objectives and then the individual projects and technologies [flow] from that.”

The ideal plan is one that promotes “forward-looking investments” that will create “lots of good jobs” over the next 50 years and that tackles the major infrastructure repair and replacement work that is too costly and unprofitable for anyone but government to do, like water and wastewater system upgrades and road work, said Macomber.

Expanding broadband service, many transportation upgrades to airports and seaports, and modernizing the electrical grid are all still potentially profitable and should be left for the private sector to sort out, he said.

Whether the country realizes what Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg ’04 has called a “generational opportunity to transform and improve America’s infrastructure” will depend entirely on what Congress can get done next.

“The best outcome, in my view, would be something where the objective is really clear — that we’re trying to increase quality of life or increase American competitiveness or get the nation ready for the next 30 years — and the project selection is clear enough, and the source of funding is clear enough that it’s bipartisan,” said Macomber.

“The bad outcome would be nothing happens and people just argue with each other. An in-between outcome would be that a single party [plan] comes through for half the money … that puts a Band-Aid on stuff.”"

President Joe Biden on Thursday will make the case for a significantly scaled-back version of his massive economic plan to expand the social safety net hours before departing for his second major foreign trip as president.

The $1.75 trillion proposal focuses on care for families, addressing the climate crisis, expanding access to health care, lowering costs for the middle class and tax reforms.

The President on Thursday morning headed to Capitol Hill to pitch his framework to the House Democratic Caucus and will later deliver remarks from the White House to make his case to the American people.

His agenda still hangs in the balance and faces an uncertain fate in Congress. Progressive House Democrats remain skeptical of the plan and want to see the full legislative text and are threatening to hold their votes for the bipartisan infrastructure package until that text is released.

The new plan makes major concessions and does not have several key planks that Biden had initially proposed, including paid family and medical leave, prescription drug pricing provisions, free community college and vision or dental Medicaid coverage.

Here’s what is included in the plan:

Children and caregiving

Free and universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, which amounts to the biggest expansion of public education in 100 years, according to the White House. It would include funding for six years.

Expanded access to high-quality and affordable child care to about 20 million children per year, with funding for six years.

Permanently improve Medicaid coverage for home care services for seniors and people with disabilities, which would make the most transformative investment in access to home care in 40 years, according to the White House.

Expanding the enhanced child tax credit that was included in the American Rescue Plan and provide more than 35 million households up to $3,600 – or $300 per month – in tax cuts per child.

Combating the climate crisis

The largest portion of the framework focuses on climate and would include the largest legislative investment in combating climate change in US history, according to the White House. White House officials say the framework Biden is set to lay out will put the US track to Biden’s Paris Agreement goal: a 50-52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels by the end of the decade.

$320 billion for clean energy tax credits. This includes 10-year expanded tax credits for utility-scale and residential clean energy, transmission and storage, clean passenger and commercial vehicles and clean energy manufacturing.

$105 billion to address extreme weather, pollution in communities and the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps to conserve public lands and bolster community resilience.

$110 in investments and incentives for clean energy technology, manufacturing and supply chains.

$20 billion to provide incentives for the government to purchase next generation technologies, including clean construction materials.

Health care

Lower premiums for 9 million Americans who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Close the Medicaid coverage gap and deliver health care coverage through Affordable Care Act premium tax credits to certain uninsured Americans.

Expand Medicare coverage to include hearing services.

Lowering costs for middle class

$150 billion to expand access to affordable housing. The plan would allow the construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of more than 1 million affordable homes.

Extend the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for about 17 million low-wage workers.

Increase the maximum Pell Grant by $550 for more than 5 million students enrolled in public and private, non-profit colleges and expand access to DREAMers.

Expand free school meals to 8.7 million children during the school year, as well as provide a $65 per child per month benefit to the families of 29 million children to purchase food during the summer.

Tax reforms

The framework will impose a 15% minimum tax on profits of corporations that report more than $1 billion in profits to shareholders. It also includes a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.

The plan would adopt a 15% country-by-country minimum tax on foreign profits of US corporations.

Would impose a new surtax on the income of multi-millionaires and billionaire – a 5% rate above income of $10 million and an additional 3% surtax on income above $25 million. The White House stresses nobody earning $400,000 or less would have their taxes raised.

It would hire IRS enforcement agents who are trained to pursue wealthy evaders, modernizing outdated IRS technology, and investing in taxpayer service.

After months of negotiations and concessions that resulted in Biden’s initial proposal of $3.5 trillion being cut in half, the White House expressed confidence on Thursday morning that this new framework would have enough support to pass both the House and the Senate.

“This will be the mean the most transformative investment in children and caregiving in generations, the largest effort to combat climate change in history, a historic tax cut for tens of millions of middle-class families and the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade,” a senior administration official said Thursday.

The official continued: “And it is entirely paid for by rewarding work, not wealth, and ensuring that the super wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and can’t cheat every honest American on their tax bills.”

After months of struggles with Covid-19, new vaccines seemed poised to tamp down the virus and unleash a period of economic growth.

But something happened on the road to recovery: the delta variant of the coronavirus. It turned the summer of independence into a summer of hesitation, and now the great economic boom seems to be locked in a perpetual state of ""coming soon"" as Americans wonder whether more twists and turns are coming in the Covid pandemic.

Data from Gallup show just how quickly the story can and did turn this summer, in a matter of just a few short months.

Data from Gallup in June found that 89 percent of Americans believed the Covid situation was getting better. You read that correctly: 89 percent. You can barely get 89 percent of Americans to agree on what day it is, but they agreed in June that things were looking up.

By July, however, the ""getting better"" figure had dropped to 41 percent, and by August it had cratered at 15 percent. And in the same surveys, the figures for Covid's ""getting worse"" moved in the opposite direction, from 3 percent in June to 46 percent in July and all the way up to 68 percent in August.

As a point of reference, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared the delta variant a concern on June 15.

Those are dramatic swings in people's perceptions of Covid, and as views changed, the economy reacted. Consumer confidence fell, ""back to work"" dates were moved, and jobs numbers became difficult to interpret — bouncing from week to week.

If you want a way to measure the impact of the delta variant, consider what has happened with travel in the U.S. One economic area stands out for being particularly susceptible to Covid concerns. Take a look at data about people flying from the Transportation Security Administration. The numbers compare travelers this year to travelers during the same period in 2019 (the last pre-pandemic year).

From January forward, the monthly numbers have shown travel getting closer and closer to pre-pandemic norms. That was true until August, when numbers inched away again.

The improvement in July compared to June takes into account tickets bought before the delta variant came to dominate the news. In the wake of the delta stories came the August dip — and there is more evidence of a travel slowdown in the weeks ahead.

A survey of regular travelers this month by Destination Analysts, a travel and tourism market research company, showed the impacts of the delta variant more directly.

More than a quarter of those surveyed said they had canceled trips because of the delta variant, and an even larger group, 34 percent, said they had postponed trips because of it.

That's a lot of meals not prepared at restaurants and a lot of potential airplane seats and hotel rooms not filled — at least for now.

The real question, of course, is when will things get back to ""normal,"" and many Americans' answer seems to be ""let me think about that.""

Destination Analysts asked travelers in mid-August what month they were targeting for overnight trips and then asked again early this month, and the answers showed notable movement in the second survey. October became more popular, and 2022 or beyond was the biggest gainer.

The increases for later months, especially for the days stretching into 2022, suggest that the delta variant is pushing travel later, when travelers presume conditions with the virus will have improved. A number of other questions showed similar trends: hesitancy for the current moment but optimism for later dates and better days.

But those better days, right now, are theoretical. The mood could shift again, as it did this summer, with a new variant or extended troubles with the delta variant. A big lesson with Covid-19 is that certainty is hard to come by.

And, of course, there's a big political element.

Nine months into the Biden presidency, ""normalcy"" remains the dream for Democrats. It would bring fuller airplanes and hotels, workplaces and restaurants — and a growing economy that they hope voters would notice.

But so far, that storyline has been elusive. As fall arrives, the path to normalcy seems, at best, unclear. And every day the calendar gets closer to 2022 and to the midterm elections."

In his first address to a joint session of Congress, President Joe Biden got some facts wrong and stretched others, mainly repeated claims we’ve heard before:

Biden said he inherited the “ worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.” But when he took office, the economy had recovered some from its low point earlier in the pandemic.

He repeated the debunked claim that he had “traveled over 17,000 miles” with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Biden referred to the American Jobs Plan creating “millions of jobs” and generating “trillions of dollars in economic growth.” The jobs estimate is accurate, but economic growth projections are mixed.

The president said he is “restoring the program” to address the causes of migration from Northern Triangle countries that “the last administration decided … was not worth it.” Although funding for the initiative declined and was delayed during the Trump administration, it wasn’t completely eliminated, as Biden’s remark may have suggested.

Biden said the “vast majority” of the “over 11 million undocumented folks” in the U.S. overstayed a visa. But immigration experts estimate that most people living in the U.S. illegally crossed the southern border without authorization.

The president claimed the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired 10 years later, “worked,” but the academic evidence isn’t clear.

Biden spoke on April 28, one day shy of his 100th day as president.

Analysis

The Economy Biden Inherited

Biden early in his speech spoke about inheriting an economy severely battered by COVID-19, the “worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,” he said. The economy was struggling, but it had improved some by the time he was sworn in.

“I stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. One hundred days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation, we all did, that was in crisis,” he said. “The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.”

As we explained in January, the U.S. lost 22.1 million jobs in March and April 2020 — and then regained about half of those by November (though, some jobs were lost in December).

The unemployment rate reached 14.8% in April 2020, but by January that figure had dropped to 6.3%. (It has since dropped to 6% as of March.)

And in the second quarter of 2020, the gross domestic product — used to gauge the health of an economy — dropped by 31.4%. But the GDP then increased by 33.4% in the third quarter, followed by 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The U.S. closed 2020 with an economy that had contracted about 3.5% from 2019 — the biggest drop since 1946.

So while the U.S. was no doubt grappling with the COVID-19 crisis and the economic fallout when Biden took office — and it still is — the country’s hurting economy had recovered some from its low point earlier in the pandemic.

Debunked Claim on Travel with Xi Jinping

In discussing the need for the U.S. to compete with the rest of the world, Biden briefly deviated from his prepared remarks and injected into his address a debunked falsehood about his travels with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“As Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi,” Biden said. “I traveled over 17,000 miles with him. Spent [over] 24 hours in private discussions with him.”

But Biden did not travel “over 17,000 miles” with Xi.

The president has touted that figure before. Our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post thoroughly examined this claim in February and could not arrive at anywhere close to that figure.

When he was vice president, Biden did meet with Xi on many occasions — including in China in 2011, in the U.S. in 2012, again in China in 2013 and once more in Washington, D.C., in 2015. We note that some of those instances included multiple meetings (for example, in 2012, they met on Feb. 14 and then again three days later in Los Angeles). But the only time that the two appear to have actually traveled together, according to the Washington Post‘s findings, was when they visited a high school in Dujiangyan during Biden’s 2011 trip to China.

An unnamed White House official told the Post that Biden’s figure was actually a “reference to the total travel back and forth — both internally in the U.S. and China, and as well as internationally — for meetings they held together.” Even then, the Post could not ascertain exactly how the 17,000-mile figure was calculated.

Mixed Economic Projections on American Jobs Act

Biden referred to the American Jobs Plan creating “millions of jobs” and generating “trillions of dollars in economic growth,” citing “independent experts.”

The jobs estimate is accurate, although barely by one measure, and the economic growth projections are mixed.

Biden’s infrastructure plan, which will cost more than $2 trillion, is projected to add 2.7 million jobs over 10 years, according to an analysis by Moody’s Analytics.

As we have reported before, Moody’s analysis concluded that the U.S. economy would add 16.3 million jobs over the next decade even if the American Jobs Plan does not pass. If it does become law, the Moody’s analysis concluded the American Jobs Plan would provide an additional 2.7 million jobs for a total of 19 million over 10 years.

In a separate report, Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce projects that the Biden plan would “create or save 15 million jobs over 10 years.”

The report does not break out the number of new jobs created, saying only that “this investment could create and/or save 15 million jobs by generating opportunities for new jobs that did not exist before the stimulus as well as providing the necessary investment to save jobs that would otherwise be lost due to state and local government budget shortfalls.”

As for the economic growth, the prognostications vary greatly.

Moody’s Analytics said the plan would boost real gross domestic product, although in the short term it would reduce growth.

In early 2022, the plan would “marginally reduce growth, as the higher corporate taxes take effect right away while the increased infrastructure spending does not get going in earnest until later in the year,” Moody’s said. But “by 2023 and throughout much of the midpart of the decade the ramp-up in infrastructure spending significantly lifts growth,” the report said. “The apex in the boost to growth from the plan is in 2024 when real GDP is projected to increase 3.8%, compared with 2.2% if the plan fails to become law.”

Penn Wharton Budget Model, on the other hand, projects that the plan would increase federal deficits, crowd out private investment and reduce economic growth.

“[T]he tax and spending provisions of the AJP would increase government debt by 1.7 percent by 2031 but decrease government debt by 6.4 percent by 2050,” the Penn Wharton report said. “The AJP ends up decreasing GDP by 0.8 percent in 2050.”

Migration from Central America

Biden suggested that former President Donald Trump’s administration ended a program to address the causes of migration to the U.S. from Central American countries — a program that Biden helped secure funding for when he was vice president. That’s not what happened.

Biden: We also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing particularly to our southern border from Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. Natural disasters. When I was vice president, the president asked me to focus on providing help needed to address the root cause of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working but the last administration decided it was not worth it. I am restoring the program and asking Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of these.

Biden appeared to be referring to the “U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America,” which was funded with as much as $750 million during the Obama administration in fiscal year 2016.

As we’ve written before, the annual budget for that initiative declined significantly during Trump’s presidency. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, appropriations for the program declined to $685 million in FY 2017, $615 million in FY 2018, $528 million in FY 2019, $533 million in FY 2020 and $506 million in FY 2021.

But the initiative wasn’t completely eliminated, as Biden’s speech may have led viewers to believe.

The president may have been referencing the fact that the Trump administration did reallocate or temporarily suspend some of the money that Congress authorized for use in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.

As a January CRS report said: “From FY2016 to FY2020, Congress appropriated more than $3.1 billion to improve security, governance, and socioeconomic conditions in Central America as part of a whole-of-government initiative to address the drivers of irregular migration. However, in March 2019 — less than two years into the initiative’s on-the-ground implementation — the Trump Administration suspended most foreign aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The Administration proceeded to reprogram approximately $396 million of aid appropriated for the Northern Triangle countries in FY2018, reallocating the funds to other foreign policy priorities within, and outside of, the Latin American and Caribbean region.”

CRS explained that the Trump administration “withheld most of the assistance Congress appropriated for Central America in FY2019 while it negotiated a series of agreements intended to stem the flow of migrants and asylum-seekers from the Northern Triangle to the United States.” That led to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development closing down or canceling some planned projects and activities.

However, the report also said that — because some members of Congress argued the funding freeze was counterproductive — aid to the Northern Triangle countries that was previously held back began to be released late in 2019. And “all of the previously suspended assistance for the region” had been “programmed” by June 2020.

The Biden administration has announced that it will restart the Central American Minors Program, which the Trump administration ended in 2017. But that program allowed qualified immigrant parents legally living in the U.S. to request that their children in El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras be brought to the U.S. as refugees.

The program aimed to provide a “safe, legal, and orderly” way for children to come to the U.S., the Biden administration said — not ultimately “keep people in their own countries,” as the president said in his address.

Illegal Immigration and Overstaying Visas

Referring to the entire population of people living in the U.S. illegally, Biden said: “On Day One of my presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. … If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it. Over 11 million undocumented folks, the vast majority of here overstaying visas.”

But the majority of the people in the U.S. illegally didn’t overstay a visa, according to independent estimates.

A February 2020 report written by Robert Warren of the Center for Migration Studies of New York estimated that, of the 10.6 million people in the U.S. illegally in 2018, “about 5.7 million (54 percent) entered across the border, and 4.9 million (46 percent) entered with a temporary visa and overstayed.”

The report does make the point that a majority of the unauthorized population who arrived between 2010 and 2018 originally came to the U.S. legally.

“Of those, 2.6 million (66 percent) overstayed their temporary visas, and 1.3 million (34 percent) entered illegally across the border,” it said.

Still, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, Michelle Mittelstadt, similarly told us in a February email: “If you look at the overall unauthorized population, we believe that slightly more than half crossed a border illegally to get here. This is because the overall unauthorized population is a long settled one – we estimate that 60 percent have been in the U.S. a decade or more – as well as the fact that in earlier periods illegal entries outpaced visa overstays.”

Assault Weapons Ban ‘Worked’

As he has in the past, Biden claimed the 10-year assault weapons ban that he helped shepherd through the Senate as part of the 1994 crime bill “worked” and should be restored. But as we wrote in March, the academic evidence isn’t clear about that.

Here’s what Biden said: “In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. … But in the early 2000s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since.”

Later in his speech, Biden said, “And we need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before, and it worked.”



Biden is referring to his work as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when he sponsored and largely shepherded the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law in 1994. That law, among other things, included an “assault weapons” ban, which prohibited the sale of certain semiautomatic firearms and large-capacity magazines that could accommodate 10 rounds or more. (Existing weapons on the banned list were “grandfathered,” meaning people could keep them.) A sunset provision, however, meant that the ban expired in 10 years, in 2004.

Biden’s mention of passing “universal background checks” refers to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required background checks for gun sales between licensed importers, manufacturers, or dealers and an unlicensed individual. Although Biden referred to it as “universal background checks,” that’s not what it was, at least not according to Biden’s use of the term in recent years. He has used the term to mean requiring background checks on “all gun sales with very limited exceptions, such as gifts between close family members” (as he put it on his presidential campaign website) — even those between private parties.

A RAND review of gun studies, updated in 2020, found there is “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings” and that “available evidence is inconclusive for the effect of assault weapon bans on total homicides and firearm homicides.”

“We don’t think there are great studies available yet to state the effectiveness of assault weapons bans,” Andrew Morral, a RAND senior behavioral scientist who led the project, told us in March. “That’s not to say they aren’t effective. The research we reviewed doesn’t provide compelling evidence one way or the other.”

There is more research, however, to back up Biden’s claim with regard to the second part of his proposal: banning large-capacity magazines. Growing evidence suggests that such a ban might reduce the number of those killed and injured in mass public shootings.

For example, research published in 2019 in Criminology & Public Policy by Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, found that while the assault weapons ban did not appear to have much of an effect on the number of mass public shootings (after controlling for population growth), the incidence and severity of mass public shootings, meaning the number killed and injured, has increased over the last decade, after the ban had expired.

Research published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020 concluded that assault weapons bans “do not seem to be associated with the incidence of fatal mass shootings.” However, state laws requiring handgun purchasers to obtain a license and state bans of large-capacity magazines did appear to be “associated with reductions in fatal mass shootings.”

In separate research also published in Criminology & Public Policy in January 2020, Christopher S. Koper, principal fellow of George Mason University’s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy, argues that the “most important provisions of assault weapons law” are restrictions on large-capacity magazines, because “they can produce broader reductions in the overall use of high-capacity semiautomatics that facilitate high-volume gunfire attacks.”

President Joe Biden on Friday signed a sweeping executive order to promote competition in the US economy, parts of which target a key business strategy used by Silicon Valley companies.

The wide-ranging order aims to lower prescription drug prices, ban or limit non-compete agreements that the White House says impede economic mobility and cracks down on Big Tech and internet service providers, among several other provisions.

“Today, I’m going to be signing shortly the executive order promoting competition to lower prices, to increase wages and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody,” Biden said at the White House.

The President said: “The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: Open and fair competition. That means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out and they have to up their game.”

“Let me be very clear: Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation,” Biden said.

The President said: “Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want. And for too many Americans that means accepting a bad deal for things you can’t go without. So, we know we’ve got a problem, a major problem. But we also have an incredible opportunity.”

The order seeks to juice competition in broadband by encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to reintroduce a so-called “nutrition label” for internet service providers that would give consumers more clear information about a provider’s services. It calls for the FCC to restrict early termination fees and to ban exclusivity deals that currently limit apartment buildings and other rental units to only one Internet provider.

It also calls on the FCC to restore the agency’s net neutrality rules for broadband companies that would prohibit them from selectively blocking, slowing or speeding up websites. Those rules, approved during the Obama administration, were pared back under the Trump FCC. Reinstating the rules would likely provoke yet another court fight on the matter.

The order also expands Biden’s assault on Big Tech companies such as Amazon and Facebook. It establishes an administration-wide policy to scrutinize mergers more heavily, including completed mergers. It zeroes-in on so-called “killer acquisitions” involving nascent competitors, the kind of deal critics say Facebook engaged in when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp.

It takes aim at a key Silicon Valley business model: The collection and use of large amounts of consumer data, and the incentive for tech companies with multiple lines of business to cross-promote their own services at the expense of competition.

“We have to get back to an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out,” Biden said. “The executive order I’m soon going to be signing commits the federal government to full and aggressive enforcement of our antitrust laws. No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies, no more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, fewer options for workers and consumers alike.”

The ink was barely dry on the order when some progressive groups began raising the question of when the White House will fill a key antitrust position at the Department of Justice.

The assistant attorney general in the Antitrust Division is among the myriad positions yet to be filled. This office is charged with enforcing the sweeping executive order.

“Can any of this be effectively implemented without an AAG for antitrust?” a top Democratic official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid directly criticizing the administration. “No, it’s not possible.”

A senior White House official, when asked about the criticism, said there was no time estimate for when a nominee would be announced for the post, which is now filled by an acting assistant attorney general.

This position, among many other vacancies across the government, is something for us to keep an eye on. It’s a bit of a reality check on the executive order – even among groups that are entirely supportive of it.

Biden’s order also calls on the Federal Trade Commission to create new rules on data collection and to bar unfair competition in online marketplaces. He also endorsed a principle known as “right-to-repair,” calling for FTC rules that ban technology manufacturers from suing independent repair shops or hindering consumers from trying to repair their own devices.

Biden will additionally call on federal regulators to create rules to cut down on non-compete agreements and ban unnecessary occupational licensing requirements, which the White House says impedes economic mobility. The President will also encourage the FTC and the Department of Justice to strengthen antitrust guidance to prevent employers from collaborating to suppress wages or reduce benefits by sharing wage and benefit information with one another.

“Workers should be free to take a better job if someone offers it. If your employer wants to keep you, he or she should have to make it worth your while to stay. That’s the kind of competition that leads to better wages and greater dignity of work,” Biden said.

Biden’s executive order also continues a Trump administration historic push to allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada, where government regulation keeps down the cost of medications. It directs the Food and Drug Administration to work with states to safely import drugs, which Biden had supported during his presidential campaign.

Many hurdles remain before this becomes a reality, however.

Several states, including Florida, have expressed interest in importing drugs as a way to lower costs. But Canada has opposed the idea, and experts question whether the country has enough of a supply to make a significant dent in US drug prices. Manufacturers have also filed a lawsuit to stop the effort.

The executive order also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a plan within 45 days to combat high prescription drug prices and price gouging. Congressional Democrats have also been formulating efforts to reduce drug prices, which is one of Americans’ chief health care complaints.

The executive order includes 72 initiatives by more than a dozen federal agencies, according to the White House. One of those initiatives is directing the US Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing proposed rules within 120 days for allowing hearing aids to be sold over the counter.

“After these rules go into effect, a pair of hearing aids could cost hundreds of dollars, not thousands. And you’ll be able to pick them up at your local drugstore,” Biden said.

It also cracks down on shipping costs for companies and prescription drug costs for Americans. It will direct the Department of Transportation to make rules forcing airlines to refund your money when the in-flight WiFi doesn’t work. It also directs the USDA to issue new rules that offer new protections for farmers, and new rules defining “Product of the USA” labels.

“Fair competition is what made America the wealthiest, most innovative nation in history. That’s why people come here to invent things and start new businesses,” Biden said.

The President said: “In the competition against China and other nations of the 21st Century, let’s show that American democracy and the American people can truly out-compete anyone, because I know that just given half a chance, the American people will never, ever, ever let their country down.”

Your 401(k)s will go to hell and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country,” Trump said in the Oct. 22 candidate debate.

Instead, the rebounding economy is headed for its best year since 1984, according to the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. economy likely expanded in the first quarter at an annual rate of 6 percent and should accelerate in the months ahead, economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics told clients this week. More than 1.3 million jobs have been added since the election.

By Trump’s preferred metric — the stock market — Biden is outperforming his predecessor at this stage of his presidency. Last summer, the Republican said stock values would “collapse” under Biden. But through Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average was up nearly 17 percent since Nov. 7, when the Democrat was declared the apparent election winner, compared with a 10.5 percent gain over a similar period following Trump’s election.

“There wasn’t much behind President Trump’s predictions other than aspirations that he’d be reelected,” said economist Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute.

Trump’s wild campaign claims of an imminent depression have complicated Republican efforts to develop an economic message that can dent Biden’s popular support. In an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox on Monday, Trump repeated his familiar boast of having built “the strongest economy in the history of the world” before the pandemic, while leveling only scattered charges against Biden.

Republicans have lashed Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan as unnecessary given the economy’s emerging strength and as being poorly designed, because some of the direct payments will go to households earning as much as $150,000 annually.

But so far, none of the attacks have drawn much support beyond the GOP base. A Gallup poll last month found that 63 percent of Americans backed the Biden plan.

“They’re struggling to put together their message,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, head of the American Action Forum, a self-described center-right policy institute.

Trump could rightly boast of having presided over the lowest unemployment rate in half a century, along with 12 consecutive quarters of growth.

But his flawed forecasting — including predictions of a stock market decline of up to 50 percent — reflected his habitual hyperbole. In December 2017, for example, he told reporters the economy could grow by up to “6 percent” a year. Instead, growth peaked at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the final three months of that year.

And during an appearance earlier this month before the Republican National Committee at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump devoted most of a nearly hour-long talk to his complaints about Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and other Republicans he said have not provided him sufficient backing.

“He makes everything personal,” said Holtz-Eakin, the chief economic adviser to senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “He won’t provide a policy critique. He’ll criticize Joe Biden, and Joe Biden’s popular, so that won’t work.”

A spokesman for the former president did not respond to a request for comment.

With more businesses reopening and recalling workers to their jobs, the economy is expected to post impressive growth for the rest of this year. But as the boom inevitably fades, the opportunity will come for Republicans to attack, Holtz-Eakin said. Already, some public opinion surveys show unease over the administration’s deficit-financed social spending.

Ironically, Trump can claim partial credit for the robust recovery. He backed the bipartisan efforts last year to provide $3.4 trillion in coronavirus relief. He also appointed Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, who led the central bank’s efforts to keep financial markets operating smoothly and to make credit widely available.

“For where we are right now, I would give most of the credit to Trump,” said Strain. “The Trump administration did a lot to preserve the productive capacity of the economy and the incomes of households, and we’re seeing the benefits of that.”

Yet as Trump fixated late last year on unfounded allegations of election cheating, the economy wobbled. A renewed coronavirus surge interrupted business reopenings and led employers to trim 306,000 jobs in December.

The economy regained its footing in mid-January as Trump conceded defeat and the components of Biden’s first coronavirus relief plan came into focus.

That signature legislative achievement, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, has just begun feeding money into the economy. Its benefits are expected to become increasingly apparent over the remainder of the year.

The real architects of the economic recovery may be those who did the most to fight the pandemic. The scientists and executives who developed the vaccines that are slowly enabling Americans to resume their normal activities deserve most of the credit for the economic rebound, economists said.

Meanwhile, the Republicans’ inability to craft an effective economic sales pitch is not unusual. The death this week of former vice president Walter Mondale, who lost the 1984 election to President Ronald Reagan, was a reminder that the opposition party often flails when times are good.

The economy grew that year at an annual rate of 7.2 percent, its best performance since the Korean War. Republican advertising boasted of “morning again in America,” and Democrats responded with an unpopular prescription for a tax increase to address the federal budget deficit that Reagan had used to fuel his boom.

“It is very difficult to campaign against a growing economy,” said William Galston of the Brookings Institution, who was Mondale’s policy director."

The next four years present a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the new Biden administration to engage with Mexico and with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) to reinforce the trade relationship between the two countries. The recent entering into force of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), global disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and administration changes on both sides of the border present a unique combination of circumstances that should be seized upon throughout the next four years.

AMLO came into office in 2018 under the auspices of a populist campaign, promising to address endemic poverty and expand development in the country. With a 62 percent approval rating, AMLO has more popular support than any other major leader in the Americas, including Joe Biden, Jair Bolsonaro, and Justin Trudeau. He has the massive popular support necessary to enact sweeping reforms, with plans to reclaim Mexico’s oil industry under state-owned enterprises and to train a modern workforce through educational programs.

Mexico is a very different country than it was before the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, with its GDP rising from $261 billion in 1990 to $1.27 trillion in 2020, making it the second largest economy in Latin America after Brazil. This phenomenal growth can be largely attributed to a strong relationship with the United States since the implementation of NAFTA. In 1990, bilateral trade between the United States and Mexico stood at just $38.3 billion, and Mexico was the United States’ third-largest trading partner. By 2019, the trade volume reached $614.5 billion, and Mexico became the United States’ largest trading partner for the first time that year.

AMLO . . . has the massive popular support necessary to enact sweeping reforms, with plans to reclaim Mexico’s oil industry under state-owned enterprises and to train a modern workforce through educational programs.

Trade, development, and investment are entwined with the issues of regional security and migration that will continue to be priorities for the Biden administration. AMLO recently appointed a new economic minister and a new deputy governor of the Central Bank, roles which traditionally advise the president on economic policy. The new appointees are anticipated to engage in more open dialogue with the private sector compared to their predecessors, and they could be key to the full implementation of the USMCA over the next four years if they can more effectively persuade AMLO. In the context of a global pandemic, a novel and open-minded cabinet, and a growing bilateral trade volume, there is no better time for the Biden administration to advance a revamped trade and investment agenda in Latin America. This historic, tumultuous moment represents a unique window of opportunity for the United States and Mexico to work together through the USMCA to not only promote their own economic recovery, but to prepare for the future in a way that will make the entire North American market competitive for years to come.

Trade, development, and investment are entwined with the issues of regional security and migration that will continue to be priorities for the Biden administration.

NAFTA and the USMCA

Trade is traditionally one of the most prominent topics of dialogue and policy between the United States and Mexico. NAFTA was hailed as a generational policy achievement, and for good reason: trade among the three member states ballooned from around $290 billion in 1993 to over $1.1 trillion in 2016, representing nearly a third of global GDP and solidifying the interdependence of the North American economies. Mexico benefited from the agreement, increasing exports to the United States tenfold from $39.9 billion in 1993 to $358.1 billion in 2019. The trade relationship between NAFTA members has also ensured general goodwill and friendly diplomatic relations over the past two decades. NAFTA was a groundbreaking accord that helped launch what was once the world’s largest free trade agreement, representing approximately 33 percent of the world’s total gross domestic product and the second largest in total trade volume.

A substantial component of U.S.-Mexico trade expansion through NAFTA has involved the creation of vertical supply chains, which strengthened the competitiveness of U.S. companies and helped Mexico accelerate its diversification of exports and imports. Vertical specialization was used in manufacturing production maquiladoras (Mexico’s export-oriented assembly plants) across the U.S.-Mexico border: maquiladoras use large amounts of imported materials produced in the United States and assemble them into the final product, and then export most of the final product back to the United States with duty-free status. Vertical specialization has allowed the United States and Mexico to leverage their economies by collaborating in the manufacturing and assembly of various products, including automobiles, computers, and electronics. Mexico is now one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world, producing almost 4 million cars per year.

Due to the process of vertical specialization and overall growth in trade, NAFTA and the subsequent USMCA have set North America up to become a unitary market with the potential to compete globally. Making the most of this vertical supply chain will be essential, given the context of China's growing influence throughout the world, and especially in Latin America and the Caribbean. Nearshoring production and implementing the various reforms of the USMCA would not only strengthen the economic and diplomatic ties between the three member states but also make the North American regional supply chain an attractive alternative to competitors like China and the European Union.

This historic, tumultuous moment represents a unique window of opportunity for the United States and Mexico to work together through the USMCA to not only promote their own economic recovery, but to prepare for the future in a way that will make the entire North American market competitive for years to come.

Changes to USMCA That Allow Regionalization

Political forces on both sides of aisle in the United States have been pushing for updates to NAFTA for years. Former president Trump made updating the agreement a central promise of his 2016 campaign, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ultimately passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 89-10. The amended agreement retained much of the structure of the previous NAFTA, but included several key changes, such as:

Enhancing the dispute settlement process;

Providing more enforceable labor provisions and requirements for Mexico to reform its labor laws and practices, such as mitigating forced labor and violence against workers;

Expanding coverage, enforcement, and monitoring of environmental protections;

Tightening vehicle rules of origin by establishing a 75 percent regional value content requirement for finished vehicles and a similar rule for automobile parts to meet the criteria for zero tariffs for automobiles;

Requiring that 40–45 percent of auto content be produced by workers making at least $16 per hour;

Incorporating new trading provisions and protections related to the digital economy;

Amending some of the patent and regulatory exclusivity provisions, especially related to the pharmaceutical industry; and

Establishing a “sunset clause” for the duration of the agreement term, leaving it open to a review every six years.

In particular, the dispute resolution mechanism and sunset clause amendments should be recognized for their potential to drive a new era of North American relations. As the Biden and AMLO administrations strive for leverage throughout the process of USMCA implementation, they will inevitably clash. For instance, the administrations have different trajectories with regards to environmental regulation, and they will likely need to address the United States’ $101 billion trade deficit with Mexico. While conflicting interests would typically impede implementation, the goal of the dispute resolution mechanism is to provide a legal framework for considering varying perspectives and avoiding runaway taxation. If dispute resolution falls through, the six-year periodic review acts as a safeguard, allowing parties to make a case for their entrenched positions at that time.

Sectors for Potential Collaboration

Energy

The energy sector is one of both growing importance and consistent dispute between U.S. and Mexican administrations, and it will be a frontier of negotiation in the coming years. Mexico is the second-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States and the largest export destination for U.S. natural gas and petroleum products. AMLO campaigned heavily on the concept of “energy sovereignty,” with the goal of reining in state-run energy companies—such as Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE)—and reinvigorating their production. The oil industry in Mexico is not only a source of employment, but is celebrated as a shared commodity that is worthy of national pride by the citizenry, leading AMLO to campaign strongly on the issue. By contrast, President Biden campaigned on increasing environmental accountability and rejoined the Paris Climate Accord on his first day in office. His environmental platform includes plans for the United States to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, create a new sector of renewable energy jobs, and work with multilaterals to address the threat of climate change.

Over the last two years, AMLO has added obstacles to environmental accountability, such as regulatory bureaucratic changes, including disincentivizing foreign investment in more than 200 energy projects. The Mexican economic ministry also directly opposed the integration of privately-owned wind and solar plants into the national power grid in a move to protect CFE. Consequently, the business climate environment in the energy sector had declined by more than half, from $2.25 billion in 2019 to approximately $1.3 billion in 2020. 23 percent of Mexico’s energy comes from renewable sources, and it is among the top 10 destinations for renewable investment in the world. However, due partly to the previously mentioned patriotic attitude towards oil and gas and a desire to help Pemex, AMLO has discontinued clean energy auctions that had previously introduced 7 gigawatts of wind and solar power to Mexico. AMLO has shown no signs of abating this behavior; on February 5 he sent an electricity reform bill to the Mexican Congress that was immediately called out as a breach of USMCA by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

President Trump and AMLO had a somewhat comfortable trade relationship, as Trump focused mostly on migration during his tenure, allowing AMLO to continue his energy policies. Biden is expected to focus significantly more on the environment, which could be done through full implementation of the USMCA. Environmental provisions under the USMCA include obligations to multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) by the parties, as well as the U.S.-Mexico Environment Cooperation and Customs Verification Agreement. Perhaps more influential are the USMCA Investment Provisions, meant to guarantee the free flow of foreign direct investment in North America and to restore investor trust and transparency. AMLO’s protectionist energy policies—and particularly his proposal to overturn a 2014 constitutional amendment that expanded private investment opportunities—would violate the USMCA.

Manufacturing

The trade of motor vehicles and machinery between the United States and Mexico is one of the most, if not the most, influential sectors of the trade relationship. Automotive and manufacturing trade represents the largest volume of Mexican exports to the United States, totaling $231 billion between vehicles and machinery in 2019 out of a total export market of $358.1 billion that same year. While U.S. exports of machinery and automobiles to Mexico are not nearly as high in volume as imports, that export market still measured an impressive $107 billion in 2019 and represented a larger share of trade than other sectors, such as agriculture and services.

Manufacturing regulations and automotive trade were a major source of controversy under NAFTA, and they ultimately became a driving force for the Trump administration to update the agreement with the USMCA. U.S. auto manufacturing jobs fell by a third between 1994 and 2013, while the Mexican auto workforce grew by hundreds of thousands in the same period. The U.S. job decline was in fact attributable to a number of factors, including hundreds of thousands of jobs lost to automation and China’s designation as a most favored nation in 2001. However, the popular idea that manufacturers were moving to the cheaper Mexican labor market gained enough political momentum to effect bipartisan support for the USMCA in 2019. On the other hand, while AMLO had long derided free trade policies as harmful to the Mexican working class, he promptly welcomed the USMCA in hopes of improving Mexico’s stagnant poverty rate. The tightening of manufacturing and labor restrictions under the updated agreement signified that both governments were unhappy with the status quo, but the challenge ahead lies in its implementation.

As the Biden and AMLO administrations coordinate in the manufacturing sector, the most important applications of the USMCA will be in job creation. The provision increasing the required automotive regional value content to 75 percent could be leveraged to reinvigorate maquiladora production, and it is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States. Working together to address Covid-19 will also be an essential part of the manufacturing agenda, since the industry was one of the sectors most vulnerable to the pandemic. Factories in both countries took a blow at the beginning of the pandemic due to mandatory shutdowns and continue to struggle in enforcing safety measures months after reopening.

Pharmaceuticals

The pharmaceutical sector is an often-overlooked part of the regional North American relationship that has enormous potential for growth. The Covid-19 pandemic exposed a lack of public health preparedness in both the United States and Mexico, particularly in terms of personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles. The United States was already heavily reliant on globally sourced PPE prior to the pandemic, due to years of inadequate budgeting and prioritization in hospitals; at the same time, Mexico was slow to react to the drastic spike in PPE demand in its own borders.

As global demand for PPE and Covid-19 tests skyrocketed, many countries turned to China for help. China produced more PPE and respirators than the rest of the world combined long before Covid-19, but the demand of the pandemic expanded Chinese mask production by 1,200 percent in February 2020 alone. China’s supply of PPE was not altruistic, as the regime often engaged in “donation diplomacy” by requiring recipients of aid to publicly thank the PRC for shipments as a publicity tool. As the United States and Mexico failed to meet the needs of even their own citizens, they missed out on a valuable opportunity to provide an alternative to the Chinese market.

While the opportunity to become a go-to site for PPE exports has passed, the United States and Mexico have the potential to work together under the USMCA to prepare themselves and the world for the next public health crisis. One provision that represents an opportunity for growth in this sector is an intellectual property (IP) protection reform that will allow leaders to negotiate a decrease in the period of regulatory exclusivity for biotechnology patents. A more liberal flow of ideas and information in the realm of pharmaceuticals would allow the best minds in North America to collaborate and lead the world on the cutting edge of medical innovation.

Agriculture

Agricultural trade between the United States and Mexico is a significant sector of each country’s export markets that will need to be preserved and strengthened under the Biden administration. The United States is Mexico’s single largest agricultural trading partner, purchasing 78 percent of Mexican agricultural exports. Likewise, U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico totaled $19.2 billion in 2019, growing 48 percent over the last decade. The phenomenal growth of agricultural trade between the two countries is due to several reforms by the Mexican government over the past 30 years and to the country’s accession to multilateral organizations, but it is of course mostly attributed to the signing of NAFTA in 1994. Between 1993 and 2018, U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico grew at an annual rate of 6.9 percent, making it one of the most consistent and reliable U.S. export markets.

Many USMCA amendments have specifically targeted agriculture, with the overarching goal of increasing access to the U.S. agricultural export market and appeasing frustrated U.S. farmers. Key updates include the termination of discriminatory wheat and dairy grading systems and increased cooperation on biotechnologies—protectionist policies which led to widespread disdain with NAFTA and caused farm workers to push for an update. The expanded access to U.S. wheat, dairy, and textiles, as well as the newly established Working Group for Cooperation on Agricultural Biotechnology, carry major potential for improving this sector. In addition to an expected increase of $2 billion annually in U.S. agricultural exports, the transparency and information-sharing provided by the Working Group may ease Mexico’s historical apprehension toward genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and allow for regional production of more resilient crops.

Despite the laudable achievements of the USMCA in agriculture, some trade tensions in the sector have emerged on both sides of the border in the first year of implementation. The AMLO administration has pursued certain divisive food and agriculture policies, such as disparaging U.S. exports of corn sweeteners, and banning the use of glyphosate and GMO corn. The Trump administration, meanwhile, pursued complaints of unfair imports on seasonal produce from Mexico, launching multiple investigations covering an estimated 44 percent of U.S. seasonal produce imports from Mexico. Resolution of such nascent disputes will be a challenge for the Biden and AMLO administrations.

Tourism

The tourism corridor between the United States and Mexico is one of the most highly frequented in the world and is an essential sector of each country’s economy. Mexico is the most popular destination for U.S. tourists, attracting 26 million U.S. visitors in 2019, more than the European Union and Canada combined. While the volume of Mexicans traveling to the United States was slightly less at 18.1 million, Mexico is second only to Canada as a country of origin for international visitors to the United States. The tourism sector constitutes 8.5 percent of Mexican GDP and a massive 77.2 percent of service exports, and it was identified as a priority economic sector in the National Development Plan of 2013–2018. Tourism consistently outperforms other major economic sectors as a share of GDP, including auto manufacturing (3.7 percent), agriculture (3.6 percent), and oil and gas (2.2 percent). Similarly, travel is the United States’ second largest export and has major growth potential under the USMCA.

The tourism industry was obviously one of the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, as lockdowns and border closures ground international flights to a halt. International tourism was down 80 percent globally in 2020, and domestic tourism came nowhere close to making up for lost revenues; North America was no exception. As countries everywhere reimagine what the tourism will look like post-pandemic, the United States and Mexico should promote open dialogue and come to a shared vision on the issue. In a world reeling from the pandemic, future tourism will be rooted in sustainability and traveler confidence. Promoting healthy environmental practices under the USMCA, as well as cooperation on issues of good governance, risk management for individual travelers, and reducing illicit activity could promote both of those goals and attract more tourists.

Rare Earth Elements

Rare earth elements have a variety of uses that may drive the future of energy and security, but the lack of emphasis on their importance in North American trade has left another gap for China to fill. Rare earth elements contain useful chemical properties applicable to a range of industries, from LED lights to weapons systems. These metals are produced through an extensive mining and refining process. The United States was historically a leading producer of these metals and remains the third-largest producer globally. While Mexico has not tapped into its supposed reserves of rare earths, it is the fourth-largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) for mining in the world and has major potential to expand in that area. Notably, since the 1990s China has experienced a near-monopoly over rare earth production and exports, with a 37 percent share of global rare earth reserves. Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping recognized the potential of rare earths and made production a top priority during his liberalization of Chinese markets. A combination of state support by subsequent administrations and lower environmental and labor standards has put China in a position of power in a market inextricably tied to global defense, transportation, and energy.

China's unmatched dominance in the rare earth sector has the potential to become adversarial and disrupt global supply chains, but there is hope for this sector in North America. Canada and the United States signed a 2019 agreement to reduce reliance on Chinese rare earth imports. Further, Mexico has plans to nationalize a newly discovered lithium mine in Sonora with some of the largest proven reserves in the world, which is currently under Chinese and British joint venture. Both the U.S. Commerce Department and U.S. Defense Department have explicitly recommended an increase in domestic production and stockpiling as a safeguard to potential Chinese manipulation. If the United States labor force shifts towards an increase in rare earth production, continued cooperation and transparency with partners under the USMCA will be important to prevent an escalation of tariffs similar to the 2019 steel and aluminum tariff debacle.

Looking Ahead

Over the next four years, the Biden and AMLO administrations will need to work together on several major areas impacting trade, including fully implementing the USMCA, strengthening the North American supply chain, managing the Covid-19 pandemic recovery process, and negotiating issues surrounding Mexico’s energy sector. A coordinated Covid-19 recovery and vaccine rollout will be the most pressing issue in the coming year, especially since the United States and Mexico have the first and third highest numbers of deaths to the disease, respectively. Mexico’s vaccination plan has been uncoordinated and disastrous so far, and a coordinated strategy for workforce vaccination will be essential to prevent further supply chain disruption. Given that the pandemic has exposed an over-dependency on supply chains in China, companies are already looking to diversify.

The United States, Canada, and Mexico should collaborate to promote the North American market as an attractive supply chain alternative to China and as a keystone to a larger strategy of nearshoring and allied-shoring in the Americas. They should encourage companies to expand capacity in the region and promote the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in certain essential sectors like pharmaceuticals, PPE, and rare earth minerals. The full implementation of the USMCA will also be vital to the trade relationship, including executing some of the more ambitious parts of the agreement like Mexico’s labor obligations.

Although full implementation of the USMCA will require a major diplomatic effort by both countries, it would produce a more resilient and competitive North American market in the long run. Key issues to address in order to achieve full USMCA implementation include infrastructural and logistical improvements at the border, massive training programs for the young workforces in each country, and open dialogue at the highest levels of each government. In pursuing the United States’ environmental goals, it will be essential for the Biden administration to be honest about the scope of regulations while reassuring the AMLO cabinet of Pemex sovereignty. Increases in free trade often lead to domestic uproar and international dispute, but thankfully the USMCA provides a legal framework for dispute resolution.

Strong cooperation on trade will create an essential basis upon which the countries can cooperate on other issues. Problems of security, corruption, and poverty persist in Mexico, with the country lagging behind the United States and Canada on many socioeconomic indicators. AMLO has attempted to address these issues through social and educational programs such as “Youth Building the Future” and “Sembrando Vida,” which aim to train Mexico’s young workforce and stimulate sustainable agriculture, respectively. Expansion and restoration of stability in trade under the USMCA could give Mexico the economic basis necessary to not only confront poverty and create jobs, but also to implement AMLO’s programs intended to create a more modern and competitive workforce. The United States should collaborate with AMLO to address core issues of poverty in Mexico through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Development Bank (IDB). The United States and Mexico should also revisit the charter for the North American Development Bank, so as to focus not only on the U.S.-Mexico border, but also on Mexico’s border with Guatemala and other impoverished parts of the country.

The potential of the USMCA is not limited to trade. The flow of ideas, goods, and people across borders contribute to a North American economic bloc beyond the pragmatics of a trade deal. The strengthening of a North American trade identity, in which the three USMCA nations not only trade with one another but build things together, is unique among free trade deals. The North American economy has the potential to ensure prosperity across the continent, outcompete China and other growing powers on the global market, and become the most attractive destination for international investors.

Presidents Biden and AMLO are at a point of immense opportunity to determine the trajectory of their two nations. Through full implementation of the USMCA and strengthening of their trade relationship, they have a chance to not only foster one of the largest trade partnerships in the world, but to also take the North American regional market to unprecedented heights. There has truly never been a moment in history like this one, and as tectonic forces continue to disrupt global actors, the United States and Mexico can work bilaterally to prevail and become a shining example of cooperation. Restoring trust in the U.S.-Mexico relationship will require diplomacy at the highest levels, transparency about desires, and full implementation of the dispute mechanisms provided by the USMCA.

But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrongly credited President Joe Biden for guiding “this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.”

Buttigieg made his remarks on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while answering a question about the supply chain disruptions that have caused delays in the delivery of consumer goods. The transportation secretary responded by saying high consumer demand — which has caused bottleneck delays at U.S. shipping ports — is a sign of a strengthening economy.

Buttigieg, Oct. 17: Demand is off the charts. Retail sales are through the roof. And if you think about those images of ships, for example, waiting at anchor on the West Coast, you know, every one of those ships is full of record amounts of goods that Americans are buying, because demand is up, because income is up, because the president has successfully guided this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.

It’s true Biden inherited a weakened economy not fully recovered from the recession. As we noted in our story “What President Biden Inherits,” the newly inaugurated president on Jan. 20 took over an “economy struggling with 10 million jobless and millions more out of the workforce.”

In September the number of people with jobs was still about 5 million below the pre-recession peak, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But Biden didn’t guide the U.S. “out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.”

Technically, economists put the end of the recession — and the start of the current expansion of business activity — nine months before Biden took office.

The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that the COVID-19-induced recession lasted just two months — from March through April 2020 — making it the shortest recession on record.

Previously, the shortest recession on record occurred during the first six months of 1980. The NBER committee said its traditional definition of a recession is one that lasts more than a couple of months, but the circumstances last year were unique.

“[T]he committee concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warranted the designation of this episode as a recession, even though the downturn was briefer than earlier contractions,” the NBER committee said, explaining the recent recession.

The NBER determines recessions based on economy-wide measures of economic activity, which reached a low point in April 2020. “May 2020 was the first month of the subsequent expansion,” the NBER committee said in its July release.

One key measure considered by the NBER when determining U.S. business cycles is real personal income excluding transfers, such as government benefits from the COVID-19 stimulus programs.

“The deduction of transfers is necessary because transfers are included in personal income but do not arise from production. This measure reached a clear trough in April 2020,” the NBER committee said in a statement on the end of the recession. (See the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis chart below that shows the steep decline in income from production in April 2020.)

Real personal income excluding transfers hasn’t quite fully recovered, but it was on its way to a full recovery by the time Biden took office. Other economic measures, too, saw relatively swift — but not full — recoveries.

After two quarters of economic contraction, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the nation’s economy grew 33.8% in the third quarter of 2020 and 4.5% in the fourth, when Donald Trump was president. And the unemployment rate – which was 14.8% in April 2020 – was 6.3% when Biden took over.

The unemployment rate has continued to recover, falling to 4.8% as of September, still a bit higher than the pre-recession rate of 3.5%.

Like anyone else, Buttigieg is entitled to his opinion on Biden’s handling of the economy. But he’s wrong to say the president “successfully guided this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.” It was over before Biden took office."

President Joe Biden’s popularity is at the lowest point of his administration. He’s averaging about a 43% approval rating, with recently released polls from Gallup (42%) and Grinnell College (37%) coming in even lower.

While the causes of Biden’s decline are numerous (e.g. declining trust of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan), perhaps the biggest one is that Americans believe there are big economic problems and that Biden isn’t focused nearly enough on them. These negative perceptions of Democrats on the economy are impacting the marquee Virginia gubernatorial election, too.

Approval of Biden on the economy has tracked almost perfectly with approval of him overall. Right now, his economic approval is in the low 40s, just as it is overall. In the early summer, it was in the low 50s – as it was overall then, too.

This decline comes as consumer confidence in the government’s economic policy has noticeably declined over the last six months, according to the University of Michigan. American consumer sentiment is significantly worse than it was a month before President Donald Trump was booted from office a year ago.

Take a look at the top concerns most Americans have right now. According to a Fox News poll released this week, 53% of voters said they were extremely concerned about inflation and higher prices. No other issue topped 50%.

A recent CBS News/YouGov poll points to why inflation (and the economy at large) is a problem for Biden. A clear majority (60%) of Americans believe that Biden is not focusing enough on inflation. No other issue tested showed that many Americans who thought Biden had not paid enough attention.

A low 37% say that Biden and his fellow Democrats are focusing on the issues they care a lot about.

This jibes with what voters say about infrastructure. A major part of Biden’s agenda is the infrastructure plan that has passed the Senate. But just 27% of voters put infrastructure down as a major concern of theirs.

You can contrast it to climate change, too. Combating climate change is part of Biden’s Build Back Better plan, which is the other bill Democrats are trying to pass through Congress. A mere 35% of voters say that’s an extremely important concern of theirs.

Though there are other parts of the Build Back Better plan that poll quite well, the overall perception of the deal is one that won’t be particularly helpful to the economy. Only about 40% of Americans say the Build Back Better plan would help them or the nation’s economy.

Of course, economic troubles aren’t just a national issue.

We’ve seen Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s lead over Republican Glenn Youngkin decline over the last few months. What once was a mid-to-high single digit advantage has shrunk to a mere 2 points in the average poll, an edge that is well within any margin of error.

Although much has been made about education, this isn’t the most important issue to voters in Virginia. Instead, it’s the economy and jobs (asked as a pair). More voters (27%) said the economy and jobs was the most important issue in their vote for governor than any other issue in a recent Monmouth University poll. More than that, this 27% is up from 21% who said it was the most important issue last month.

Indeed, one of the biggest edges Youngkin has over McAuliffe on any issue is the economy and jobs. By a 5-point margin, more voters trust Youngkin over McAuliffe on the economy. The only issue on which Youngkin holds a larger advantage is taxes, which is another economic issue.

The fact that the economy is playing such a large role both nationally and Virginia shouldn’t be a surprise when taking the long historical view. Normally, the economy plays a predominant role in our politics. It’s just that over the last five years, amid the entirety of the Trump administration and the coronavirus pandemic, the economy seemed to take a back seat.

After nine months of the Biden administration, though, what the American electorate is saying is a sign that our politics are becoming a little more normal again."

According to the latest PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll, 54 percent of U.S. adults approved of Biden’s handling of the economy, including 94 percent of Democrats and 48 percent of independents. Another 38 percent of Americans disapproved of Biden’s economic leadership, including 82 percent of Republicans.

Trump’s handling of the economy topped out at 53 percent of Americans at its highpoint in July 2019, according to Marist polling data. In the most recent nationally representative poll, 1,266 U.S. adults were interviewed from April 7-13 and the margin of error is 3.3 percentage points.

Biden’s economic numbers are in line with his overall approval rating, with 53 percent of Americans saying they support the president’s job performance in his first few months in office. Another 39 percent disapprove of Biden’s performance.

While most Americans approve of the steps Biden has taken so far, many are still struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic, which drained much of the economic gain that Trump touted during his time in office. Millions of Americans remain out of work, and the jobless rate is still higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

To jumpstart the economy, the Biden administration unveiled the American Jobs Plan on March 31. The $2.3 trillion proposal would invest money in the nation’s infrastructure, such as roads and airports, the electrical grid and water systems, and the White House estimates it would create millions of jobs.

A majority of Americans — 56 percent — support Biden’s plan to invest in the nation’s infrastructure, but he will still struggle to push the ambitious plan through a politically divided Congress, where Democrats have lean majorities in both the House and the Senate. Republicans are already putting up roadblocks, largely because of the scope of the plan and how Biden plans to fund it.

Biden has referred to the plan as a “once-in-a-generation investment in America,” comparing it in scale and impact to the creation of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and winning the Space Race a decade later. He called the American Jobs Plan “the single largest investment in American jobs since World War II.”

“Infrastructure is about meeting the needs of a nation and putting Americans to work,” he said. “Fifty years from now, when people look back, they’ll say this was the moment, together, that we won America’s future.”

In many places, the nation’s infrastructure has reached catastrophic levels of disrepair. Years after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, first gained national attention, many residents still rely on bottled water because tap water is still dangerous to drink. And unsafe drinking water is a problem all across the country where lead pipes are still in use.

The pandemic has served to further highlight other national infrastructure issues. When schools were forced to close and teachers to launch remote learning, many children struggled to connect to virtual classrooms because they did not have adequate internet access.

A historic winter storm in February exposed deficiencies in the electrical grid for millions of residents in Texas and Mississippi, which left many without power for days and was linked to a number of deaths.

“Our infrastructure is lacking and holds us back from competing in the global economy,” said Stephanie Aaronson, vice president and director of the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution.

The Biden plan seeks to address all of the problems above. But it also expands upon how infrastructure has traditionally been defined, bringing under its umbrella essential home care workers and improving the resilience of infrastructure to the effects of climate change, which disproportionately hurt communities of color. The pandemic raised awareness that these changes are necessary, Aaronson said.

In this latest poll, 40 percent of Americans said the Biden plan “is about right,” and another 20 percent said it “does not go far enough.” But 23 percent said it goes too far.

The plan the president set before Congress is “just so expansive,” said Michael Strain, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Removing lead pipes is one thing, he said, but including in-home care for the elderly and people with disabilities is another.

“There are things the president is proposing that I think are great, and would be good to do. And there’s a lot in there that we need to take a harder and more critical look at,” he said.

The question of how to pay for these improvements has fueled much of the debate around infrastructure. Roughly two-thirds of Americans support increasing taxes on people who earn more than $400,000 a year, according to the Marist poll. That includes 90 percent of Democrats, 66 percent of independents and 32 percent of Republicans. Most U.S. adults — 63 percent — also approve of taxing at least 21 percent of earnings that American companies make in other countries.

But Americans were far more reluctant to voice their support for measures that would have them footing the bill for some of Biden’s proposed improvements. Only 28 percent of U.S. adults backed increasing the gas tax to help pay for the infrastructure plan — nearly 30 years have passed since the country last increased the gas tax — and 30 percent supported increasing usage fees, such as highway tolls. And 20 percent supported raising taxes on all Americans.

Americans often bristle at these taxes because they seem to violate a sense of fairness, especially in light of what is often perceived as generous corporate tax cuts, said Barbara Carvalho, who directs the Marist poll.

A large part of the debate among legislators in Congress is over how to pay for Biden’s ambitious plan, or whether to pay for all of it. But Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that the nation’s infrastructure is increasingly demanding attention and action, both for the immediate needs of Americans but also for the country’s ability to compete on the global stage."

President Biden has chosen to keep Jerome Powell in place for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman — a move that signals continuity with the central bank's policies at a time when the economy faces critical challenges, including surging inflation

Biden nominated current Fed governor Lael Brainard to serve as vice chair. Brainard had been seen as a leading contender to replace Powell.

Under Powell and Brainard the Fed has kept interest rates near zero despite the current high prices for all kinds of goods, as it focuses on returning the economy to full employment and as policymakers argue that inflation will prove temporary.

""Powell and Brainard share the Administration's focus on ensuring that economic growth broadly benefits all workers,"" the White House said in a statement.

Biden's pick to stick with Powell will likely reassure financial markets, despite opposition from some progressive members of the president's own party.

Powell, a Republican, was originally appointed to the Fed's governing board by former President Barack Obama and was elevated to the chairman's post by then-President Donald Trump.

As chairman, Powell has steered the central bank's aggressive response to the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, slashing interest rates to near zero and quickly launching a series of emergency lending programs.

Powell also oversaw a new Fed policy that directs the central bank to be patient in raising interest rates in hopes of fostering more widespread job growth.

That policy was adopted in 2020 after years in which inflation fell short of the Fed's 2% target, but it's now being tested as prices have surged, pushing inflation to a 31-year high.

The Labor Department says prices in October were 6.2% higher than a year ago, the sharpest increase since 1990.

Powell and his colleagues believe today's price hikes are largely the result of temporary factors tied to the pandemic, which should ease on their own as the health outlook improves. It's a view that's been challenged by some economists and prominent Democrats such as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

The central bank has to weigh the risk of tolerating higher inflation against the cost of choking off job growth with higher interest rates at a time when millions of people are still out of work.

""It's extremely important that we get that right,"" Powell said recently at a conference sponsored by the South African Reserve Bank. ""I am confident that we will do so over the course of the next year or so. I think in the meantime, it's going to be extremely challenging, certainly in the short term.""

Powell has faced opposition from progressives

Progressive critics, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have accused Powell of watering down bank regulations adopted in the aftermath of the financial crisis. At a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing, Warren described Powell as ""a dangerous man.""

That criticism failed to get much traction, though. The co-sponsors of the Dodd-Frank law behind those bank regulations, former Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and former Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., have defended Powell and said he deserves a second term.

Powell has also had to navigate an ethics controversy after reports this fall that two former presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks actively traded stocks and other securities last year, at a time when the central bank was heavily involved in financial markets.

Former Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren retired last month after the trades came to light. Both men have denied any wrongdoing, but Kaplan acknowledged that the controversy could be a distraction for the central bank. Rosen said he was stepping down for health reasons.

The Fed's inspector general is reviewing the two men's trades, which appear to be in compliance with the central bank's rules at the time. The Fed has since adopted stricter rules that limit the trading of individual stocks and bonds and require disclosure of any trades within 30 days.

""We have to have the complete trust of the American people that we're working in their interest all the time,"" Powell said in describing the new rules.

In nominating Powell for a second term, Biden is observing a tradition that Fed chairs typically don't change, even when the party in control of the White House does. That's one way to safeguard the central bank's political independence. Trump broke with that tradition when he replaced then-Fed Chair Janet Yellen, a Democrat who is now Treasury secretary, with Powell four years ago.

Powell's nomination is subject to confirmation in the Senate, where he is expected to get broad, bipartisan support."

President Joe Biden has spoken regularly about the economy in the past month – trying at once to reassure Americans about inflation, draw attention to job growth and earn support for his signature infrastructure and social spending proposals.

But some of Biden’s economic claims aren’t true. And some of them are missing important context.

Let’s look at four of the things he said in November and on the first day of December.

The unemployment rate

In an economic speech last week, Biden made a series of comments about the unemployment rate.

“We’ve made historic progress over the last 10 months. Unemployment is down to 4.6%, two years faster than everyone expected. When we started at this job, it was over 14%,” Biden said.

Facts First: Biden was wrong in two ways here. First and most importantly, his phrasing created the inaccurate impression that the unemployment rate was over 14% when he “started at this job” as president. In fact, the unemployment rate in January 2021, the month he was sworn in, was 6.3%; it had not been above 14% since April 2020. Second, while the unemployment rate has fallen faster under Biden than some experts had expected, he exaggerated when he said the 4.6% rate was achieved two years faster than “everyone” expected. It happened roughly one year faster than the Federal Reserve had projected in December 2020.

Biden strongly suggested that all of the “historic progress” in bringing the unemployment rate down from more than 14% to 4.6% happened “over the last 10 months,” the period in which he has been in office. But the majority of the decline occurred during the final months of Donald Trump’s presidency.

The unemployment rate spiked under Trump on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, jumping from 3.5% in February 2020 to a pandemic-era peak of 14.8% in April 2020. Then the rate started falling, hitting 6.3% in January 2021. So far, through October, it has fallen another 1.7 percentage points during Biden’s tenure.

A White House official, who responded to CNN’s questions on condition of anonymity, said that when Biden spoke about unemployment being above 14% “when we started at this job,” he was referring to the peak of the pandemic, not the start of his presidency.

But this section of Biden’s speech was focused on the achievements of his administration over the past 10 months. He certainly didn’t make it clear that, for this particular claim, he was reaching back to a starting point during the last year of the Trump era.

As for Biden’s claim about the 4.6% rate being achieved “two years faster than everyone expected”: “Everyone” was too strong. The Federal Reserve, for one, projected in December 2020 that the unemployment rate would average less than 4.6% – 4.2%, to be precise – in the fourth quarter of 2022. (The Federal Reserve projection is a median of projections from Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents.)

The White House official said Biden was referring to how the 4.6% rate had been achieved two years faster than the Congressional Budget Office had projected. But Biden said “two years faster than everyone expected,” not “two years faster than the Congressional Budget Office expected.”

The Nobel winners and inflation

To promote his Build Back Better Act, a $1.9 trillion bill that would expand the social safety net and fund initiatives to address climate change, Biden has repeatedly cited an important line from a September open letter that was signed by 17 winners of the Nobel Prize in economics.

The President said in an economic speech on Wednesday: “Seventeen Nobel laureate winners … have written a letter affirming that this bill will reduce inflationary pressure in the economy.” He tweeted on November 21: “As 17 Nobel Prize winning economists have declared: My plans will ease inflationary pressures.” He wrote in a statement on November 10: “17 Nobel Prize winners in economics have said that my plan will ‘ease inflationary pressures.’ ”

Facts First: Biden left out a key phrase from the Nobel winners’ letter – in which they made it clear that they weren’t saying the President’s plan would alleviate the inflation affecting the country right now. Rather, the Nobel winners wrote that Biden’s agenda would alleviate “longer-term” inflationary pressures. The relevant sentence read as follows: “Because this agenda invests in long-term economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more Americans to participate productively in the economy, it will ease longer-term inflationary pressures.” The letter did not discuss the issue of short-term inflation.

It’s normal for politicians to paraphrase experts rather than quoting their every word, but this Biden omission significantly changes the meaning of the Nobel winners’ sentence. When CNN reached out last week to two of the letter’s signatories, both of them made clear that the phrase “longer-term” was significant.

Christopher Sims, a Princeton University professor of economics, said in an email: “So long as the legislation retains significant revenue raising as it goes through the Senate, it will probably have little short-term effect on inflation, and could even, by demonstrating that Congressional near-deadlock is not preventing significant revenue-raising, dampen medium term inflation. Nonetheless the impact of the legislation on inflation is uncertain, especially in the near term, so the letter’s ‘long term’ phrase was important.”

Eric Maskin, a Harvard University professor of economics and mathematics, said in an email: “The two pieces of legislation — the infrastructure act and the (Build Back Better) bill — have the potential to reduce inflationary pressure in the longer term because they should expand productive capacity and therefore supply. It is much harder to say what their effect on inflation might be in the short to medium term.”

It’s worth noting that Biden sometimes did include a reference to the “longer-term” phrase when discussing the letter; he did so in a speech in Minnesota on Tuesday. Still, he has more often left it out. The November 10 written statement featured the most egregious of the omissions: The President – or, more likely, an aide writing under his name – put the words “ease inflationary pressures” in quotation marks, suggesting he was giving a direct quote from the letter, but still left out the phrase “longer-term.”

Unemployment benefits

Biden tweeted last week: “Last year, there were 21 million unemployment insurance claims before the Thanksgiving holiday. Today, there were 2.4 million. It’s historic progress.”

Facts First: Biden left out key context here. His numbers were correct, taken straight from newly released Department of Labor data about the week that ended on November 6. However, in portraying this decline in unemployment claims as an unqualified success story, he didn’t mention that a significant percentage of the decline happened not because of economic improvement but because the federal government’s special pandemic-era unemployment programs expired in early September and about half of state governments ended those programs earlier. When the programs went away, millions of people could no longer make unemployment claims even though they were still not working; some of them eventually got jobs, experts say, but some didn’t. “The tweet is a misleading measure of progress,” said Peter Ganong, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Chicago.

The pandemic prompted a major federal expansion of unemployment benefits that started in 2020, including new programs to cover people who had run out of their normal state benefits and to cover those who would not normally be eligible, such as independent contractors and the self-employed. But these pandemic-era programs expired on September 6, 2021 – and even before that, governors in 26 states, 25 of them Republicans, decided to end at least some of the programs early. (As CNN’s Tami Luhby reported, courts forced two of these states to preserve the programs until early September.)

It’s tricky to pinpoint what percentage of the decline Biden touted is attributable to the ending of the special programs, but it’s clear that the percentage is substantial. Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank that has closely tracked the impact of the pandemic-era programs, and Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist and associate professor at the University of Minnesota, said Thursday that just under a third of the total decline over the past year – about 5.4 million of the decline of about 18.4 million – can be attributed to workers being cut off of state and federal aid, not people finding jobs

The White House official said the labor market is undoubtedly stronger today than it was at this time in 2020. No question – but Biden said something more specific.

The number of small businesses

Biden said in the economic speech on Wednesday: “The number of small businesses is up 30% compared to before the pandemic.”

Facts First: There is no basis for Biden’s claim; Ray Keating, chief economist at the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council advocacy organization, said it is “not correct.” Intentionally or unintentionally, Biden was inaccurately describing a statistic he had explained somewhat better – though still not precisely – in a speech last week. The statistic is actually about a certain group of business applications for tax identification numbers; it is an indicator of new entrepreneurship, but it says nothing about the number of small businesses that already existed in the country.

Biden “is confusing the data or not using it correctly. One cannot simply use one set of data as if it is another set of data,” Keating said. “The President’s point should be that it is great that business applications for tax IDs are at record levels. And yes, this will translate into more new businesses, and hopefully that’s happening now and will accelerate. This is a hopeful indicator.”

A White House official said Biden was referring to figures that show a roughly 35% increase this year, compared with 2019, in a subset of of business applications for tax identification numbers. Specifically, the White House official said, the President was talking about applications for entities that are thought to have a high likelihood of turning into businesses with payrolls. So in the speech last week, Biden said, “Americans are starting small businesses at a record rate – up 30% compared to before the pandemic.”

Even this claim was flawed, Keating said, since “these are just applications at this point, not businesses.” Though some of them will certainly become businesses, “we simply don’t know how many have been started.”

Biden’s Wednesday claim was more inaccurate. While there is an ongoing boom in the number of Americans starting their own businesses, and while there were about 4.5 million total new applications for tax IDs in the first 10 months of this year, it’s not true that a roughly 35% increase in new “high likelihood” applications means the country has seen a 30% increase in the total number of small businesses in the country.

Keating said we don’t know how many small businesses there are in the US today, since there is an extended lag time in the official data on this subject. Regardless, Biden’s “30%” claim didn’t take into account the number of small businesses that existed prior to the pandemic – according to the federal Small Business Administration, there were about 32.5 million businesses with fewer than 500 employees in 2018, about 26.5 million businesses with no employees – and didn’t take into account the number of small businesses that have shut down during the pandemic, which is not definitively known.

Keating said, “We need to factor in the businesses that have been lost for a complete picture.”"

President Joe Biden signed a wide-ranging executive order Friday afternoon aimed at minimizing the stranglehold of monopolies on certain industries and increasing competition among companies, which the White House believes will benefit consumers by driving down prices.

""The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition. That means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out, and they have to up their game. Better prices and services, new ideas and products. That competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing. Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world's greatest force of prosperity and growth,"" Biden said in remarks ahead of the order signing.

In a ""competitive economy,"" companies must also compete for workers, he said.

""Offering higher wages, more flexible hours, better benefits. But what we've seen over the past few decades is less competition and more concentration that holds our economy back. We see it in big agriculture, in big tech, in big pharma. The list goes on,"" he continued. ""Rather than competing for consumers, they are consuming their competitors. Rather than competing for workers, they're finding ways to gain the upper hand on labor. And too often, the government has actually made it harder for new companies to break in and compete.""

Here’s a breakdown:

Job growth is slowing down.

Despite huge advantages of the re-opening economy, life-saving vaccines, and trillions in stimulus spending, President Biden created 1.4 million jobs fewer in the first six months of 2021 than President Trump did in the last six months of 2020.

Economic growth is slowing down.

The Congressional Budget Office now predicts economic growth after the sugar-high of stimulus is significantly slower under President Biden than under President Trump.

In July 2020, CBO forecast economic growth between 2023-2030 would average 2.1%. Since Biden took office, CBO has now lowered expectations to a mere 1.5% – a nearly 30% reduction in growth.

Economic optimism is down.

The six-month outlook for the U.S. economy plunged to a five-month low of 50.8. (Reminder: it hit a 14-year high of 57 in February 2020 under the TCJA!)

Real wages are down.

Annualized real wages are down 3.95%.

President Biden’s net job approval on the economy is down–in fact, it’s sliced nearly in half over the past month.

Americans are losing faith in his economic leadership, worried about impending tax increases, and a higher cost of living.

The only thing that’s up is rising prices.

Inflation has been caused by massive government spending and President Biden paying people more to stay on the couch than to return to work.

For all these reasons, including his economic attack on American-made energy and proposed crippling tax hikes on workers, farmers, and Main Street businesses–the grade President Biden has earned in his six-month Economic Report Card: an ‘inflation-adjusted” F.

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand the public’s views on how the Biden administration has addressed national issues in the first 100 days of its presidency, including evaluations of the coronavirus economic aid package and COVID-19 vaccine distribution. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,109 U.S. adults in April 2021. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

Joe Biden approaches the 100-day mark of his presidency with a relatively strong job approval rating and the public continuing to express positive views of the coronavirus aid package passed by Congress last month. Moreover, nearly three-quarters of Americans (72%) say the Biden administration has done an excellent or good job managing the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to Americans.

Currently, 59% approve of the way Biden is handling his job as president, while 39% disapprove. Biden’s job approval rating has increased modestly from 54% in March. Biden’s job approval is comparable to several of his predecessors – including Barack Obama and George H. W. Bush – and much higher than Donald Trump’s in April 2017.

Views of Biden and his administration highlight several stark contrasts with opinions of his predecessor. Far more Americans say they like the way Biden conducts himself as president (46%) than say they don’t (27%), while another 27% have mixed feelings about his conduct. Similarly, 44% say he has changed the tone of political debate for the better, while 29% say he has made the tone of debate worse (27% say he has not changed it much).

On both questions, there are sizable differences in views of Biden and Trump. Last year, just 15% said they liked the way Trump conducted himself as president, which was little changed from telephone surveys dating to 2017. In both 2020 and 2019, majorities (55% on each occasion) said Trump had changed political debate in the U.S. for the worse.

However, the share of the public saying they agree with Biden on important issues is little different from the share saying that about Trump last year. Fewer than half of Americans (44%) say they agree with Biden on all or nearly all (13%) or on many (31%) of the important issues facing the country; 25% say they agree with Biden on a few issues, while 29% say they agree with him on almost no issues. Last year, 42% of Americans said they agreed with Trump on nearly all (19%) or many issues (23%).

The new national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted on the Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel from April 5-11, 2021 among 5,109 adults, finds that the administration gets high marks for handling the manufacture and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. Note, the survey was conducted prior to the FDA and CDC April 13 recommendation to pause the administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

While an overwhelming share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (88%) say the administration has done an excellent or good job in managing the vaccine rollout, so too does a much smaller majority (55%) of Republicans and Republican leaners.

The Trump administration receives far lower ratings for how it managed the manufacture and development of COVID-19 vaccines (43% say they did an excellent or good job). However, a 55% majority of the public – including 86% of Republicans and nearly a third (31%) of Democrats – express positive views of the Trump administration’s support for the development of COVID-19 vaccines by several pharmaceutical companies.

Public support for the coronavirus aid package, which Biden signed into law a little more than a month ago, remains robust. More than twice as many Americans approve (67%) than disapprove (32%) of the $1.9 trillion aid bill. That is little different from the 70% who favored the economic aid package in March, shortly before it was enacted.

More Americans expect the economic aid bill will benefit the country than themselves: 55% say the aid package will have a mostly positive effect on the country as a whole. Fewer than half as many (26%) say it will have a negative effect, while 18% say it will not have much of an effect. About half (49%) expect that the aid bill will have a mostly positive impact on themselves and their families.

While the coronavirus legislation has gotten a positive response from the public, the public has somewhat mixed views of whether Biden’s economic policies are making the economy better when compared with Trump’s. About four-in-ten (43%) say the policies of the Biden administration are making the economy stronger than it was during Trump’s presidency; 36% say his administration’s policies are making the economy weaker, while 20% say they are not making much of a difference.

As is the case with the public’s overall views of the U.S. economy, assessments of how Biden’s policies have affected the economy are deeply divided along partisan lines. About three-quarters of Republicans (76%) say Biden’s policies are making the economy weaker compared with the policies of his predecessor, while nearly an identical share of Democrats (74%) say Biden’s policies are strengthening the economy.

The survey finds that, for the most part, the public’s views of major problems facing the U.S. are little changed from about a year ago. However, the share of Americans saying the coronavirus is a very big problem has declined 11 percentage points since last June (from 58% to 47%), while the share citing illegal immigration has increased 20 points (from 28% to 48%).

While views of most national problems are divided along partisan lines, including illegal immigration, increasing shares of both Republicans and Democrats rate illegal immigration as a very big problem. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (72%) say illegal immigration is a major problem, up 29 points since last June. The share of Democrats who say this is a major problem is now 29%, compared with 15% nearly a year ago.

Over this period, Republicans and Democrats have moved in opposite directions in concerns about the federal budget deficit. Currently, 71% of Republicans say the budget deficit is a very big problem; about half of Republicans (49%) said this in June 2020. By contrast, just 31% of Democrats rate the deficit as a major problem, down from 45% last year."

If the president sticks to his guns, it could mark another milestone in the great policy rethink that got under way after the 2008 financial crisis.



Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid plan would be the second-largest injection of federal cash in U.S. history. Only last year’s Cares Act was bigger -- but that came at the start of the pandemic, when the deepest recession in decades lay directly ahead.

The next round of fiscal support, by contrast, will flow into an economy that’s already bounced much of the way back."

159,The importance of USMCA for the Biden administration's economic and foreign policy | Brookings - Brookings Institution,The importance of USMCA for the Biden administration's economic and foreign policy | Brookings  Brookings Institution,"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb29raW5ncy5lZHUvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGhlLWltcG9ydGFuY2Utb2YtdXNtY2EtZm9yLXRoZS1iaWRlbi1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbnMtZWNvbm9taWMtYW5kLWZvcmVpZ24tcG9saWN5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Brookings Institution,"In her confirmation hearing, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai stated that “trade is like any other tool in our domestic or foreign policy. It is a means to create more hope and opportunity.” With this in mind, President Biden has made clear that trade must improve wages and create higher-paying jobs for all Americans as he focuses on controlling COVID-19, restoring economic growth and employment, and expanding opportunity by investing in education, R&D, and infrastructure. In this respect, there is no more important regional trade agreement for the U.S. than the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA).

USMCA builds on NAFTA in ways that underscore how much international trade policy has shifted from a focus on tariffs to nontariff regulatory issues. In fact, USMCA largely keeps NAFTA’s tariff rates, retaining tariff free U.S.-Mexico trade and including some further market access improvements with respect to U.S.-Canada trade.

The USMCA builds on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which first integrated the region’s economies when it came into effect in 1994, but also presents a new template for North American relations. USMCA was the first free trade agreement backed by the AFL-CIO labor union and it passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support (89-10 compared with 60-38 for NAFTA in 1993). This support underscores the agreement’s potential for rebuilding consensus on how to advance economic integration consistent with good jobs, growing wages, strong labor standards, and environmental protection. To maintain broad political support, however, the Biden administration will need to continually engage, both domestically and with partners in Canada and Mexico, to ensure USMCA is delivering on its promise. The USMCA sunset clause requiring joint review and agreement on renewal in year 6 of the agreement provides added urgency to getting the USMCA right.

The Biden administration has signaled that one of its priorities will be strengthening diplomatic relationships with America’s traditional allies , including Canada and Mexico. Following Trump’s “America First” approach, an early and visible commitment to strengthening the economic relationship between the three North American partners would be a welcome signal that the Biden administration will prioritize alliance diplomacy.

The significance of USMCA is clear. Canada and Mexico are the United States’ largest export markets: 23 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada and Mexico (versus 5 percent to China), over 70 percent of Mexican exports are sent to the U.S. and Canada, and 62 percent of Canadian exports are to the U.S. and Mexico. Trade among the countries provides key inputs into regional supply chains’ value added (40 percent U.S. value add versus 5 percent China). This is particularly true in the auto sector, which dominates manufactured trade between all three countries. The importance of resilient supply chains has also been made abundantly clear in light of the impact of COVID-19, and as competition with China exposes vulnerabilities to relying on Chinese supply chains. The Biden administration has ordered a review of U.S. supply chains , with the objective of decreasing American dependence on Chinese production of critical inputs. Integrated North American supply chains could provide a viable alternative to Chinese manufacturing and allow some critical industries to move production closer to home.

The USMCA addresses regulatory differences that create unnecessary barriers to trade. It also rebalances rights and obligations, rolling back some commitments, such as access to investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS), and strengthening commitments in support of labor rights, environmental standards, and small businesses. Stricter rules of origin for autos that require 75 percent local content (up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA) should also create incentives for domestic manufacturing, another potential win for workers.

An early focus on implementation and compliance is needed

How the USMCA works in practice will be key to sustaining the high level of bipartisan support. The most immediate need is for all governments to fully implement and comply with the agreement. The Trump years undermined other governments’ faith in U.S. commitment to the rule of law, which also undermined the business certainty these agreements are meant to provide. Indeed, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) identified reduced investor uncertainty, highlighting the importance of compliance by all governments if the benefits of USMCA are to be realized. Strict U.S. compliance at home, combined with a willingness to use USMCA enforcement tools to address compliance issues in Mexico and Canada, can help restore faith in the U.S. government’s commitment and signal that business can rely on the agreement when making decisions to trade and invest.

The administration also needs to invest in making the agreement’s many committees productive and dynamic, using these institutional mechanisms to give the effect of a living agreement. For example, a new Competitiveness Committee will bring together officials from the three countries to assess the implementation and identify scope for further integration to increase regional competitiveness. Furthermore, it creates opportunities for the partners to continually review and update their associated trade and investment policies—but only if governments meaningfully invest in the process.

As noted, USMCA also includes a “joint review” mechanism, which calls for the three countries to come together every six years to identify where the agreement is succeeding and where it is falling short. The review mechanism was controversial during the negotiations, as critics worried it would introduce greater uncertainty and could be used as pretext for a government to pull out of the deal. Yet the ultimate impact of the review mechanism will depend on how governments use it: whether they approach it not as a chance to air grievances and threaten withdrawal but as an opportunity for ensuring the trade agreement is functioning effectively.

The new USMCA monitoring, research, and engagement project at Brookings will track where the agreement is delivering and identify areas where improvements are needed.

Ultimately, the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican governments should use USMCA as the backbone for a renewed vision of North American competitiveness, helping the three partners align their economic strategies and interests amid a shifting global political economy. Yet, such an outcome will not simply spontaneously emerge because the trade deal is in place. Rather, it will require ongoing commitment, attention, and (where necessary) adjustment from leaders. This is one of the reasons why we intend to closely follow the USMCA implementation over the coming years.

The new USMCA monitoring, research, and engagement project at Brookings will track where the agreement is delivering and identify areas where improvements are needed. We will leverage our convening power to bring to the table key stakeholders—the U.S. administration and Congress, leading government officials and legislators in Canada and Mexico, business, labor, and civil society—on specific issues such as impact on labor rights and wages, support for digital trade, and how USMCA strengthens (or not) North American supply chains. We will monitor progress and present policy options for strengthening the agreement.

At one of the first roundtables convened at Brookings earlier this month, senior business, academic, and civil society representatives from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada stressed the importance of USMCA for North American competitiveness, particularly amid a post-COVID-19 push to build more resilient regional supply chains. But they also noted some potential stumbling blocks, pointing to the need for increased government engagement.

In the coming months, ensuring effective implementation and high compliance with the agreement will be critical and will require policymakers’ ongoing time and attention. Former Secretary of State George Schultz used to compare diplomacy to gardening: Successful diplomacy requires continual tending, pulling weeds before they overwhelm the fertile ground. Trade relationships require similar attention from policymakers—checking in with partners, addressing irritants before they become lingering disputes, coming up with strategies to address new shared challenges, and building on the successes that create more hope and opportunity for all."

Unleash a wave of entrepreneurship. Growth will pick up and more jobs will be created. Everybody benefits. That, in essence, is trickle down – a theory of economics that Joe Biden wants to consign to the dustbin of history.

The US president was a young politician when the idea that cutting taxes on the well-off would be good for the poor first came into vogue in the 1970s. Now he has used his first address to a joint session of Congress to call on the US’s top 1% to pay for his $1.8tn (£1.3tn) American families plan – higher spending in areas such as education, childcare and infrastructure.

Anticipating pushback from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Biden had a simple message. It was time, he said, to build the country from the middle and the bottom outwards, not from the top down. “Trickle down has never worked,” he said.

The postwar story of the US economy can be divided into two distinct periods: a period from the late 40s to the middle of the 1970s when, as President John F Kennedy said, “a rising tide lifted all boats”; and the trickle-down period ever since.

In the former, the dividend from a growing economy was shared evenly among income groups. Those in the top 10% of earners grew richer at the same rate as those in the bottom 10% of earners. Since the mid-70s, average incomes have flatlined once inflation has been taken into account, while most of the gains from growth have gone to those at the top.

A recent paper by the economists Carter Price and Kathryn Edwards fleshed out what that has meant in reality. They calculated that the incomes of the poorest 10% of Americans would be $2.7tn higher had income growth remained as equitable as in the years up until 1975. Cumulatively, the gains to those often struggling to get by on poverty wages would have amounted to $47tn between 1975 and 2018.

Supporters of trickle-down economics say the low levels of pre-crisis unemployment, the US’s record of growing faster than Europe, and the ability of the US to spawn giant world-beating companies all suggest that cutting taxes on the better off does pay off.

Yet, Biden and his supporters would argue that the real comparison is between the US before and after the mid-1970s. In the 50s and 1960s not only was the world’s biggest economy a less unequal country, it also grew faster. Investment was higher, and so were rates of growth of productivity. This was achieved with an income tax rate on the rich that peaked at 91% – under a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower.

Biden needs an explanation for why he is reversing the strategy of his predecessor, Donald Trump, by putting up federal income tax to just under 40% for Americans earning more than $400,000 a year. He believes he has one: the end of trickle down will be good for ordinary Americans – and good for the economy, as well."

President Biden Announces Members of President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology



Thirty Distinguished Leaders Represent Most Diverse PCAST in U.S. History, Will Develop Science and Technology Recommendations to Address Nation’s Most Pressing Challenges

WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden announced 30 of America’s most distinguished leaders in science and technology as members of his President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). A direct descendent of the scientific advisory committee established by President Eisenhower in 1957 in the weeks after the launch of Sputnik, PCAST is the sole body of external advisors charged with making science, technology, and innovation policy recommendations to the President and the White House.

Drawing from the nation’s most talented and accomplished individuals, President Biden’s PCAST includes 20 elected members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, five MacArthur “Genius” Fellows, two former Cabinet secretaries, and two Nobel laureates. Its members include experts in astrophysics and agriculture, biochemistry and computer engineering, ecology and entrepreneurship, immunology and nanotechnology, neuroscience and national security, social science and cybersecurity, and more.

The members represent the most diverse PCAST in U.S. history. PCAST is traditionally co-chaired by the President’s Science Advisor and 1-2 external co-chairs; since its inception in 1957, no women have ever served as co-chairs. President Biden’s PCAST has two women co-chairs. And, this PCAST reflects the President’s commitment to build an Administration that truly looks like America: for the first time ever, women make up half of PCAST, and people of color and immigrants make up more than one-third of PCAST. Its diversity will help the council bring to bear a wide range of perspectives to address the nation’s most pressing opportunities and challenges, so that science, technology, and engineering benefits all Americans.

“The future of America depends on science and technology like never before,” said PCAST Co-Chair and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Dr. Eric Lander. “President Biden understands that addressing the opportunities and challenges we face – to our health, our planet, our economic prosperity, and our national security – will require harnessing the full power of science and technology. Scientific progress depends on people seeing things in new ways, because they bring different lenses, different experiences, different passions, different questions. This PCAST is uniquely prepared because of its extraordinary scientific breadth, wide range of work experiences, and unprecedented diversity.”



“We are thrilled that some of our most accomplished Americans are willing to step up and serve the nation by being members of PCAST,” said PCAST Co-Chair Dr. Frances Arnold. “Their vast expertise will help the nation build back better through science and technology.”

“Science and technology permeate so many elements of government decision making,” said PCAST Co-Chair Dr. Maria Zuber. “I am excited to bring this historic and brilliant group’s knowledge, experience, and innovative thinking to bear on the nation’s toughest challenges in science and technology and navigate an equitable and inclusive path forward for the nation.”

As directed in the President’s executive order establishing PCAST, the council includes advisors from outside the federal government who are responsible for advising the President “on matters involving policy affecting science, technology, and innovation, as well as on matters involving scientific and technological information that is needed to inform public policy relating to the economy, worker empowerment, education, energy, the environment, public health, national and homeland security, racial equity, and other topics.”

PCAST CO-CHAIRS

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand the public’s views on President Joe Biden’s job performance, the nation’s economy, and proposed infrastructure bills. The study also surveyed adults about Biden’s handling of Afghanistan and views about the admittance of thousands of Afghan refugees into the country. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,371 U.S. adults in September 2021. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

With his administration facing multiple challenges at home and abroad, President Joe Biden’s job approval rating has fallen sharply in the past two months. Fewer than half of U.S. adults (44%) now approve of the way Biden is handling his job as president, while 53% disapprove. This marks a reversal in Biden’s job ratings since July, when a 55% majority approved of his job performance and 43% disapproved.

Since spring, public confidence in Biden has declined across several issues. In March, majorities expressed confidence in him across six of seven dimensions, including his handling of the public health impact of the coronavirus, and foreign and economic policies. Today, about half still express confidence in his handling of the coronavirus and the economy – but majorities have little or no confidence in him in four other areas.

Positive evaluations of several of Biden’s personal traits and characteristics have shown similar decreases. Compared with March, fewer adults say Biden cares about people like them, and fewer describe him as standing up for his beliefs, honest, a good role model and mentally sharp.

While opinions about Biden remain sharply divided along partisan lines, the decline in his public standing has come among members of both parties. On his job rating, for example, there has been a 13 percentage point decline in the share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who approve of Biden’s performance (from 88% in July to 75% today); only 9% of Republicans and GOP leaners approve, down from 17% two months ago.

The new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 13-19 among 10,371 adults on the Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel, finds that Biden is not the only political leader in Washington whose job ratings have fallen. Just 27% of Americans approve of GOP congressional leaders, down 5 percentage points since April. The decline in approval ratings for Democratic leaders in Congress has been even larger, from 50% to 39%.

There also are signs that the public is generally becoming more pessimistic: Just 26% say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, down from 33% six months ago. And while views of current economic conditions remain lackluster – 26% rate them as excellent or good – expectations for the economy over the next year have become more negative than they were in the spring.

Currently, 37% of Americans say economic conditions will be worse a year from now, while 29% say things will be better; 34% expect little change. In March, more said economic conditions would improve (44%) than get worse (31%) over the next year, while 24% said conditions would be about the same as they are now.

As has been the case since he took office, Biden draws more public confidence for his handling of the public health impact of the coronavirus than other issues.

About half (51%) are very or somewhat confident in his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, but that is down from 65% in March. The shares expressing confidence in Biden’s handling of economic policy, foreign policy and immigration policy also have declined.

Biden continues to draw less confidence for unifying the country than on dealing with specific issues; only about a third (34%) are confident he can bring the country closer together, a 14 percentage point decline since March.

Assessments of Biden’s personal traits also have become less positive. While majorities say he stands up for what he believes in (60%) and cares about the needs of ordinary people (54%), larger shares described Biden in these terms six months ago (66% and 62%, respectively).

Biden receives his least positive assessments for being mentally sharp. Currently, 43% say this describes Biden very or fairly well, an 11-point decline since March.

Other important findings from the survey:

Majority favors admitting Afghan refugees into the U.S. A 56% majority favors admitting thousands of Afghan refugees into the U.S. while 42% are opposed. There are sizable partisan differences in these attitudes: More than twice as many Democrats (75%) as Republicans (35%) favor admitting refugees who fled Afghanistan. The Biden administration continues to receive negative ratings for its handling of the situation in Afghanistan. Only about a quarter of adults (24%) say the administration has done an excellent or good job in handling the situation with the country; 26% say it has done only fair, while nearly half (48%) rate its performance as poor.

About half favor each of the congressional infrastructure proposals. As congress prepares to take up a pair of infrastructure proposals, more Americans view each one positively than negatively. However, a quarter or more say they are not sure about the proposals (respondents are given the option of saying they are not sure).

About half of adults (51%) say they favor the bill passed by the Senate last month that would provide $1.2 trillion in funding over the next 10 years for infrastructure improvements, including roads, bridges and internet upgrades. Just 20% oppose the bill, while 29% say they are not sure.

A comparable share (49%) favors a proposed $3.5 trillion, 10-year package that includes funding for universal pre-K education, expanding Medicare, reducing carbon emissions and other projects. A quarter oppose the spending package, while a quarter are unsure.

Broad support for raising taxes on large businesses, high-income households. About two-thirds of Americans (66%) favor raising taxes on large businesses and corporations, including 37% who say taxes should be raised “a lot.” A somewhat smaller majority (61%) says tax rates should be raised on household income over $400,000; 26% say these tax rates should be raised a lot, while 35% favor raising them a little.

Rising prices a leading economic concern. A majority of adults (63%) say they are very concerned about rising prices for food and consumer goods. That is larger than the shares citing other economic issues – employers being unable to hire workers (42% very concerned), people facing eviction or foreclosure (35%) or people who want to work being unable to find jobs (29%). Republicans are more likely than Democrats to cite rising prices and a shortage of workers as top concerns; Democrats are more likely to be very concerned over evictions and foreclosures and people who want to work struggling to find jobs."

Daniel Bressler

President Biden has committed to achieving a net-zero economy by 2050 and reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, in line with international efforts to keep temperature increases well below 2 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst damages from climate change. While President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and Build Back Better Agenda will create good-paying, union jobs and grow an equitable economy, many fear that reducing carbon emissions will place a burden on consumers through higher prices. After all, most greenhouse gas emissions come from energy production, and the costs of energy take up over 8 percent of the income of the typical American low-income household. More broadly, carbon emissions are embedded in the prices of many of the goods and services that a typical American consumer purchases, like food, housing, and transportation (Figure 1).

How does President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda, which includes the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, Reconciliation Package, and new regulations, avoid burdens on consumers, given how embedded carbon is in the typical family’s consumption basket? Four major strategies help reduce emissions while keeping costs down for consumers: 1) help consumers get more with less money by increasing energy efficiency; 2) continue to reduce the costs of clean energy; 3) use the Federal government’s capacity to make investments in a cleaner economy; and 4) recognize the (very) high costs of inaction for consumers.

1) Help consumers get more with less money by increasing energy efficiency. As new ideas have come to market, many household goods and home improvements are now more energy efficient, which can save consumers a significant amount of money over the life of a household appliance. However, there are often large, upfront costs to making these investments, which is especially problematic for lower-income families who often lack the necessary liquidity. In other cases, consumers may not know of the potential savings over the life of a product, relative to the upfront cost. Well-targeted Federal funding, such as consumer rebates for home retrofits, can incentivize investments that provide net benefits to the country while enabling American families to consume less energy—reducing energy bills in the process. For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that 29 new or updated appliance standards put in place between 2009 and early 2015 are projected to cumulatively save nearly $480 billion for consumers between 2009 and 2030.

In addition to more efficient buildings, the President’s policies will improve the efficiency of the nation’s transportation system, making it more accessible and affordable for Americans. The recently proposed vehicle standards are projected to yield close to $140 billion in fuel savings for new vehicles sold by 2030, far outweighing any associated increase in sticker prices. On top of this, a combination of tax credits, producer incentives, and a national charging network will make fuel-efficient electric vehicles competitive with other new cars. Moreover, the infrastructure bill’s $39 billion investment in public transit and $66 billion investment in rail will provide Americans with affordable and convenient transportation options, thus encouraging more attractive options than driving for many trips.

2) Continue to reduce the costs of clean energy. Until recently, a rapid transition to clean electricity looked anything but cheap. But the costs of solar and onshore wind have plummeted in the past decade (Figure 2), in large part due to support from governments around the world. Today, carbon-free power sources, like solar and wind energy, are often the lowest-cost options.

The President is proposing historic investments in clean energy technologies, including those ready for rapid deployment immediately—such as solar and wind—as well as those at earlier stages of development, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Other countries around the world are making similar investments, vying for global leadership in clean energy industries.

As a consequence of this “race to the top” in climate investments, the clean alternatives in sectors across the economy may start looking more like the cheap alternatives in the power sector today, thus helping to ensure the country is poised for deep emissions cuts in the future.

3) Use the Federal government’s capacity to make investments in a cleaner economy.

In addition to Federal investments to spur innovation of emerging energy technologies, direct subsidies to energy producers can limit the costs of clean energy to consumers and accelerate the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. Subsidies can encourage producers to reduce emissions by bringing down their costs to produce clean energy, relative to other energy sources. From a consumer cost perspective, this is preferable to alternative ways to reduce emissions, such as regulations that prohibit or limit carbon-based energy, which tend to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices of carbon-intensive energy. In terms of who ultimately pays the cost of these subsidies, while American consumers fund the government, the progressive tax base means that government funding of emissions reductions can be a more equitable option than strategies that would more likely impose these costs on consumers.

In the power sector, the President’s proposals include a portfolio of incentives and investments—largely paid by the government—that can help ensure power sector emissions fall rapidly this decade, in line with the President’s goal of a carbon-pollution free power sector in 2035. A recent report from UC-Berkeley finds an 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 is achievable without increasing average electricity costs above today’s levels.

4) Recognize the (very) high costs of inaction for consumers. The President’s plan to keep costs low for consumers includes protecting them from the costs of inaction on climate change over the longer term. Our collective failure to address climate change will continue to add costs to family budgets in the decade to come, which can be reduced if we can bring down carbon emissions now.

The United States has incurred about $120 billion per year in damages from extreme weather and climate events over the past five years, and these costs are on course to accelerate as the planet continues to warm. For example, in the Western United States, the three most expensive wildfire years have occurred in the past four years. This year alone, nearly one-in-three Americans lived in a county hit by a weather disaster, more than any prior year. Americans pay for the costs of extreme weather directly by, for example, fixing flooded basements, and also indirectly, through higher insurance premiums and government spending on disaster relief.

On top of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, pollution from fossil fuels contributes to worsening health and well-being of Americans. Local air pollution produced by fossil fuel combustion causes premature death, exacerbates existing health conditions, leads to higher infant mortality, and reduces worker productivity, especially among lower-income groups and communities of color. Heat exposure alone is estimated to cause 12,000 premature deaths annually in the continental United States. Between 1991 and 2018, 35 percent of the heat-related deaths occurring in the United States are attributed to anthropogenic climate change. By the end of the century, deaths from heat exposure are expected to increase by 36,000 per year in a moderate emissions scenario and 97,000 per year in a high emissions scenario.

Because climate change will tend to hit low-income regions and individuals harder, it is expected to widen existing economic inequality. In a study estimating the economic damage of climate change in the United States, the poorest decile of counties is projected to suffer median losses that are 9.5 times larger than the richest decile of counties (when losses are measured as a percentage of baseline income).

Conclusion

In conclusion, investing in an economy that is more resilient in the face of increasingly severe floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and droughts will limit costs to Americans and help deliver on the President’s goal of building back better with a cleaner, fairer, and more productive economy."

Among the hardest-hit industries: travel. The U.S. travel economy has lost about $500 billion since the pandemic began last March — a daily loss of $1.75 billion, according to the U.S. Travel Association.

Biden has promised to take a number of steps to restore the nation’s confidence in travel. Here are a few of the steps that he’s been asked or has committed to take.

Larger health role for DOT

During the pandemic’s early days, transportation groups begged U.S. Department of Transportation officials to require airlines and other transportation companies to provide protective equipment to workers and require their use.

But the DOT made it clear: Its role was to coordinate with other agencies and provide a regulatory environment that made it easier to move goods and services.

“While the FAA remains steadfast in its focus on safety of flight, we are not a public health agency,” wrote FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson in late March when asked by Air Line Pilots Association International President Joe DePete to make mandatory CDC guidelines on protecting workforces from the spread of the coronavirus.

Three months later, the message was unchanged. “DOT is not a public health agency,” a DOT spokesman said after transportation workers complained to a House panel about the absence of such a requirement.

The assertion, said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, is “100 percent absurd.”

DOT has taken the lead on banning e-cigarettes from airlines, she said. It played a major role in helping to quash the transmission of Ebola. And the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has argued since at least 1999 that because DOT oversees airlines, it does not have jurisdiction over aircraft crews.

Greg Regan, secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department at the AFL-CIO, said Biden and Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg would likely take a more aggressive approach.

“DOT is a public health agency,” Regan said. “It does have a responsibility when it comes to public health in our transportation system.”

Mask mandate

While nearly all passenger airlines have instituted some passenger mask requirement, Nelson said Biden’s promise to require masks on all interstate travel would provide much-needed uniformity.

For example, some airlines initially did not ban masks with face valves, though most have since moved to do so. Other airlines have varying policies on medical exemptions or mask requirements for young children.

In October, Biden promised to institute a nationwide mask mandate, and he’s since said he will ask Americans to join him for 100 days of mask wearing after he is sworn in.

That’s a sharp difference from the Trump White House, which has rejected a universal mask requirement on public transportation.

In July, the White House opposed as “overly restrictive” a spending bill that included an amendment by Rep. David E. Price, D-N.C., the chairman of the House Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, requiring masks on planes, trains and buses.

The DOT also rejected a petition from a group called the “Flyers Rights Education Fund” seeking a mask mandate at airports and for U.S. airlines, saying the department believes “there should be no more regulations than necessary.”

Nelson said much of the heavy lifting has already been done, with most airlines requiring masks. Now, she said, a federal mandate that will create uniformity “is job number one.”

Messaging

In the days after the 9/11 attacks, the federal government put out unified messaging: If you see something, they urged, say something.

Such messaging is one of the most important things the federal government can do to ensure confidence in travel once the pandemic is passed, analysts say.

Martina Jones-Johnson, a founding member and board officer for the Black Travel Alliance, said standardization of rules — and clear messaging on what those rules are — would help people who must travel figure out the best way to do so safely.

“America in general — we’re just a very individualistic culture,” she said. “As much as we say we’re all in this together, a lot of people don’t feel that way. Some unifying message could maybe make us feel more together.”

But messaging, she warns, can only go so far.

“We need something to get rid of this virus,” she said. “That’s when we’ll start to do a lot of traveling.”

Vaccinating transportation workers

While labor groups representing transportation workers say they have no interest in cutting ahead of health care workers or vulnerable populations, they’ve made it clear believe their members should be a priority population for the COVID-19 vaccines.

“We are absolutely advocating flight attendants be among the first to get vaccinated,” said Nelson, who added that transportation workers are on the front lines and thus more likely to be exposed.

Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy for the U.S. Travel Association, argues that some aspects of the travel industry should be prioritized because of frequent interaction with the public. She includes airline workers, hotel workers and restaurant workers.

“If they were able to have the vaccine, it gives a greater protection to those out and about,” she said. “It would lessen the chance of others getting the virus.”

More money

Even as Congress worked late last year to finish up a $908 billion coronavirus relief bill with $45 billion in aid for the travel industry, Biden said it was merely a “down payment” on what was needed to revive the economy.

The relief, which includes $15 billion to reinstate payroll reimbursements to airlines, will only last through March. The law also includes $1 billion for airline contractors, $2 billion for airports and concessionaires, $14 billion for transit, $10 billion for state highways, $1 billion for Amtrak and $2 billion for buses, motor coaches and ferries.

Barnes said additional stimulus funding in a Biden presidency would help guide the economy through the remainder of the pandemic.

“To get folks moving, we need consistent recovery to get us through this next year,” she said, saying the package that passed in December was “a bridge to 2021.”

For some modes, such as airlines, it was the second tranche of funding. The first round of $25 billion worth airline payroll funding, which was part of the $2 trillion stimulus bill, expired in October, leading to tens of thousands of furloughs.

Nelson said many of the furloughed workers who returned have to be recertified and re-credentialed, and by the time that’s done, the newest round of aid will be expiring.

“We’ve seen how damaging this was to let this lapse,” she said. “We can’t let it happen again.”"

US President Joe Biden will hold his first event with other leaders from the Group of Seven nations in a virtual meeting on Friday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, the world economy and dealing with China, the White House said on Sunday.

The meeting is the first by top leaders from the G7 group of rich democracies since April, it said.

“This virtual engagement with leaders of the world’s leading democratic market economies will provide an opportunity for President Biden to discuss plans to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, and rebuild the global economy,” the White House said in a statement.

The White House said Biden would focus his remarks on a global response to COVID-19 vaccine production and distribution as well as “continued efforts to mobilise and cooperate against the threat of emerging infectious diseases by building country capacity and establishing health security financing.”

Biden, a Democrat who took over from Republican former President Donald Trump on January 20, has sought to project a message of re-engagement with the world and with global institutions after four years of his predecessor’s “America First” mantra.

Trump withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris climate accord and largely scoffed at multilateral organisations and groups.

Biden brought the US back into the WHO and rejoined the Paris accord and has signalled a desire to work with allies in confronting China on a host of thorny issues.

The China challenge

“President Biden will also discuss the need to make investments to strengthen our collective competitiveness and the importance of updating global rules to tackle economic challenges such as those posed by China,” the White House said.

Trump challenged China over its trade policies by imposing punishing tariffs, an instrument he also used on the US’s traditional allies, drawing criticism for not taking a more unified approach to stand up to Beijing on issues such as intellectual property theft and other economic practices.

Domestically, Biden is pressing Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion stimulus package to boost the US economy and provide relief for those suffering from the pandemic.

The White House said he would discuss his economic agenda with G7 counterparts and encourage them and all industrialised countries to maintain “economic support for the recovery” and other collective measures.

Climate change would also be on the agenda.

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke to her G7 counterparts last week and called for continued fiscal support to secure the economic recovery."

The chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Cecilia Rouse, had him as an adviser in graduate school. And Gene Sperling, who will oversee the president’s $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan, used to make annual trips with him to a Florida tennis camp.

Just about everywhere you look in the Biden White House, you can see former treasury secretary Larry Summers’s influence. Everywhere, that is, except for the policies.

Summers, 66, who drafted economic blueprints for the past two Democratic presidents and was a top candidate to lead the Federal Reserve Board under President Barack Obama, has emerged in recent weeks as the loudest critic of President Biden’s approach to reviving the pandemic-era U.S. economy. The Harvard University professor — who advised Biden for a time last summer — warns that the president’s stimulus plan may trigger the highest inflation in more than half a century and could cost Democrats the chance to make lasting investments in the economy.

Summers’s Cassandra-like critique has ignited a firestorm among some of the most liberal members of his party, who blame him for financial industry deregulation in the 1990s that contributed to the financial crisis and for the anemic recovery that followed. But his arguments also have been swatted aside by his erstwhile allies in the White House, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, who argue that the economy is in desperate need of help.

“This might not have struck as much a nerve if it didn’t reflect concerns that were widely felt,” Summers said in a 45-minute telephone interview last week.

The extraordinary clash between a globally recognized Democratic economist and a Democratic president hoping to enact the most transformative liberal agenda since the Great Society involves both the central issues of the day and the lessons of history.

If he at times uses dramatic language, Summers nonetheless has given voice to an unpopular opinion that many in the Democratic camp say deserves consideration. Few other Democratic economists have aired such concerns; some say doing so might harm Biden’s ability to translate his fragile congressional majority into decisive action.

Summers’s complaint about an oversized stimulus “was what a lot of people were saying privately, what was being whispered by people without his voice or without his platform who were nervous about going public,” said Jason Furman, who was Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers chair and disagrees with Summers’s inflation assessment.

At issue are the risks and opportunities involved in restarting a $20 trillion economy and the unresolved debate over the mistakes made in responding to the 2008 financial crisis.

Summers says the Biden administration’s spending plan was drafted to satisfy political realities rather than economic requirements, and it is courting disaster. The Biden brain trust and other economists, including Paul Krugman, a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, say he’s misreading the moment and overstating the downside risks.

“The discussion he’s trying to push is one we should have,” said Claudia Sahm, a longtime Summers critic and a former Federal Reserve staff economist who is now at the Jain Family Institute. “But it’s so out of proportion. And since [the bill] passed, he’s gotten more and more vicious.”

Summers began warning of economic overheating late last year, criticizing the proposed $2,000 stimulus checks for individual Americans as “bad economics.” When he made that argument, in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion, the idea had already been endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). Biden joined them days later.

Last month, as Congress was considering Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, Summers criticized it in a Washington Post opinion piece as excessive and poorly designed. Too much would be spent sending checks to people who didn’t need the money, while almost nothing would be used to increase the economy’s long-run potential, he said.

Summers acknowledged that the Obama administration hadn’t spent enough to bolster the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. But Biden’s rescue plan would learn that lesson too well, adding too much fuel to an economic fire that would already be raging by the time the money arrived.

The pandemic had punched a roughly $20 billion hole in Americans’ monthly wage income, he said. Biden proposed filling it with more than $100 billion. Coupled with the Federal Reserve’s ultralow interest rates, Washington’s spendthrift ways could send prices soaring.

“I know the bathtub has been too empty,” Summers said. “But one has to think about what the capacity of the bathtub is and how much water we’re trying to flow into it.”

Summers worries that a reopened economy could rev out of control. Either a surge of demand overwhelms producers and sends prices soaring or the Fed will try to prevent that inflationary spike by abruptly hiking interest rates, plunging the economy into a new recession.

There’s only a 1-in-3 chance that the administration enjoys a boom that settles into years of sustainable growth, he said.

“We’re taking substantial risks,” Summers said.

The United States could suffer the sort of price spiral that hasn’t been seen since the late 1960s, when President Lyndon B. Johnson refused to raise taxes to cover the combined costs of his domestic agenda and the Vietnam War, he says. From 1.6 percent in 1965, inflation ticked up to nearly 6 percent five years later.

The architects of Biden’s plan say any inflationary risks pale alongside the damage that could be done to millions of Americans if the administration doesn’t restore a vibrant economy. Spending on roads, bridges and rural broadband networks, which could lift economic growth in the long run, was always envisioned as the second part of a two-step maneuver.

Plus, much of the $1.9 trillion in spending will fill economic holes without adding to demand, such as with government payments to forestall evictions.

“A relief plan is different from a stimulus,” said Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist who served with Summers in the Obama White House.

The economy is likely to run a little hot for about a year, but not as hot or as long as in the late 1990s, he added. Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen both anticipate only a temporary burst of rising prices. Investors likewise anticipate average annual inflation of 2.1 percent starting five years from now, according to one standard market gauge.

“The risk of generalized overheating in the goods market appears low for the time being,” economists at Goldman Sachs told clients this week. A second Goldman study found “no evidence” that pandemics inevitably lead to an increase in inflation.

Others say Summers’s inflation concerns conflict with his calls over the past several years for large-scale government spending to ward off “secular stagnation,” or a permanent shortfall of demand. He denies changing his views, saying instead that by spending $1.9 trillion on short-term needs, the administration may miss the chance to obtain funding for the long-term investment plan that Biden plans to unveil this week.

If they had “been arguing for a $4 trillion stimulus over 10 years to build back America, that would have been fine. I would have been a huge enthusiast for that,” he said.

For Summers, the current dust-up is just the latest chapter in a high-octane career marked by more than its share of personality clashes and contention.

Awarded the prestigious Bates Clark medal, which recognizes economists under the age of 40 who have made the most significant contribution to economic thought, Summers taught at Harvard before becoming chief economist at the World Bank. He served as President Bill Clinton’s treasury secretary during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and was by Obama’s side during the global financial crisis a decade later.

Alongside his acknowledged genius rides a reputation for disregarding social niceties. Some in Washington still recall his public evisceration of economist Emmanuel Saez during a 2019 panel discussion on the wealth tax.

Sarcastic and merciless, Summers criticized Saez’s arguments as “absurd” and called his data “substantially inaccurate and substantially misleading.” The audience at the normally sedate Peterson Institute for International Economics at one point audibly groaned as Summers pounded Saez for flabby thinking.

“Most of Larry’s difficulties in playing well with others had less to do with malice and more to do with obliviousness. For Larry, qualities like tact and restraint just cluttered the mind,” Obama recalled in his memoirs.

Summers’s current position on the sidelines of a Democratic administration is more unusual than uncomfortable. He can still command an audience, and his criticism of the administration, while pointed, does not appear to have burned any bridges.

“They take his substance seriously,” said one prominent Democratic economist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal White House thinking. “Their attitude is not, ‘He’s dead to us.’ They care about his views.”

The White House declined a request to interview a member of the president’s economic team for this story.

Others predict that those views will cost him a seat at the table.

“Nobody can call attention to a topic quite like Larry can,” said Goolsbee. “Sometimes that helps them define an agenda, but sometimes that help comes by defining it in the negative. Given the hostile nature of this argument, I would be surprised if Summers were at the top of the administration’s ‘seeking advice’ list for infrastructure policy ideas or whatever comes next.”

Some liberals say his criticism is the outgrowth of frustrated personal ambition, citing Summers’ failure in 2013 to secure the Fed chairmanship he had long coveted. But his inflation concerns, aired in newspaper columns, are shared by others, including Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.

Furman, a Summers ally, says the former treasury chief has gone overboard with his rhetoric. Earlier this month, Summers said the United States now has “the least responsible macroeconomic policies we’ve had in the last 40 years.” And he irked some administration officials when he wrote that the administration was dismissing “even the possibility of inflation.”

Speaking from the White House podium last month, Jared Bernstein, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, called that assertion “just wrong.”

Summers publicly took himself out of the running for an administration job last summer. But he’s hardly idle. He still teaches at Harvard and sits on the boards of Square, a mobile payments company, and Doma, a San Francisco-based provider of technology designed to simplify real estate closings. He also writes newspaper opinion columns and gives paid speeches.

He says he’s focused on making the most of his multiple outside roles, rather than finding his way back into government.

“All of my plans and expectations are around doing economic analysis and contributing to both the academic and public debate on economic policy,” he said. “And if I’m raising issues that people are feeling a need to think about and grapple with, then I think I’m making a significant contribution.”

With his high-profile inflation forecast, Summers has staked out the “I told you so” terrain if Biden’s plan misfires. But for now, despite his repeated warnings of disaster, policymakers — his friends, mentees and former colleagues — remain unconvinced."

For good or ill—and, in my view, it is very positive—the Biden White House is pursuing a bold and aggressive program of Keynesian economic management, the likes of which Washington hasn’t seen since the nineteen-sixties.

The argument began, last week, with a warning about the Biden plan from Lawrence Summers, the Harvard economist who served as the Secretary of the Treasury toward the end of the Clinton Administration and as the director of the White House National Economic Council during Obama’s first term. Whatever good the Biden spending package might do in boosting output, wages, and profits, Summers wrote in the Washington Post, it was so large that it could also “set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the dollar and financial stability.” Over the weekend, Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, seconded Summers’s concerns, tweeting, “The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive.”

Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” on Sunday, the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, didn’t entirely dismiss the argument that Summers and Blanchard put forward. She said that the possibility of inflation picking up as the economy rebounds from the pandemic was “a risk that we have to consider,” but she also insisted that policymakers have the “tools to deal with that risk if it materializes.” Delighting Democrats who want to break with the past, Yellen emphasized the need to pull the economy out of its COVID-19 slump rapidly and restore full employment. Citing a Congressional Budget Office study that predicted that the jobless rate wouldn’t return to its pre-pandemic level until 2025, she said, “There is absolutely no reason why we should suffer through a long, slow recovery.” CNN’s Jake Tapper pressed Yellen on how quickly the Biden plan might bring down the jobless rate, which is now at 6.3 per cent. (Before the pandemic, it was just 3.5 per cent.) Given the danger of making a bold promise that opponents could seize upon, most politicians would have punted on Tapper’s question. Yellen tackled it head on. “I would expect that if this package is passed we will get back to full employment next year,” she said.

This prediction may have been partly designed to win support for the Biden plan on Capitol Hill. However, it also reflects an important change in economic thinking on the part of Yellen and other Biden economic advisers, some of whom harbor painful memories of the slow-paced Obama-era recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-09. Based on the severity of the current crisis, and the experience of the past decade, the Biden team is tossing out, at least for now, the textbook model of economics that policymakers have relied on for decades.

As an economic counsellor to Bill Clinton during the nineteen-nineties, and then as chair of the Federal Reserve Board, from 2014 to 2018, Yellen paid lip service to this model, which dates back to theoretical work done by the economists Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps in the nineteen-sixties. In its most simplistic form, the model says that there is a strict lower limit for unemployment and a strict upper limit for G.D.P. growth, and that these limits can’t be violated without sparking an inflationary spiral. In issuing their warnings, Summers and Blanchard were effectively arguing that a post-coronavirus economy, revved up by widespread vaccinations and another $1.9 trillion in stimulus, could well breach these speed limits, with potentially disastrous results.

As always in economics, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The only definitive way to find out whether the inflation threat is real or chimerical is to pass the $1.9-trillion package and see what happens. Still, the Biden Administration’s determination to go big reflects at least three persuasive counter-arguments to the Summers-Blanchard line. Despite some progress on the vaccination front, the future path of the pandemic remains uncertain. Even if the number of infections does fall rapidly, and G.D.P. growth rebounds sharply, experience suggests that the economy’s speed limits aren’t nearly as strict as the textbooks make out. Moreover, even if we do end up breaching these limits, the benefits, in terms of job creation and higher wages, could well exceed the costs, in terms of inflation. In other words, a bit of economic overheating could be a good thing for most Americans.

Back in 2014, when Yellen became the chair of the Fed, the Congressional Budget Office produced an estimate of roughly 5.5 per cent for the rate of unemployment at which inflation would start to take off. (Even the most ardent defenders of the old model conceded that the exact threshold was uncertain.) Yet, during Yellen’s four-year tenure as Fed chair, the unemployment rate tumbled from 6.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent—and for most of the time the inflation rate remained below the target rate of two per cent. After Yellen left the Fed, the jobless rate fell even further, and inflation still didn’t pick up much: in December, 2019, the inflation measure that the Fed monitors most closely stood at just 1.6 per cent—no sign of overheating there. Defenders of the traditional model sought to rationalize this departure from its predictions, but the fact was that they simply didn’t know what the economy’s real speed limit was. That’s still true today.

We can be certain that the economy has lost nearly ten million jobs since this time last year, and the employment-to-population ratio—the broadest measure of the tightness in the labor market—has declined by 3.7 percentage points. Both of these figures back up Yellen’s point that there is a great deal of economic ground to be made up. Another thing we know for sure is that running the economy hot—that is, with a very low unemployment rate—would be good for American workers, particularly those earning low wages. When labor is scarce, employers have to pay higher wages to attract and retain it. After many years of stagnating, American wages finally picked up around 2015, and, since then, some of the biggest gains for workers came among the lowest paid. In 2019, when the jobless rate hit historic lows, the wages of those in the bottom decile of the wage distribution rose by 5.7 per cent—the biggest jump in many years.

Among economists, there is some debate about the relative importance of a low unemployment rate and state-level hikes to the minimum wage in sparking such wage growth. Nearly everyone agrees, however, that the tight labor market played an important role—and Biden’s economic advisers are keenly aware of this lesson. History “shows that lower-income workers—and Black and brown workers—see the largest wage gains when the economy is at full employment,” Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, two members of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in a blog post last week. Getting “back to full employment, as quickly as possible, will make a major difference in the lives of tens of millions of people, particularly those most at risk of being left behind,” Bernstein and Boushey added."

While a sizable majority says the Biden administration has done well in managing the manufacture and distribution of vaccines, far fewer (43%) give the Trump administration positive ratings for how it handled this while in office.

However, the Trump administration receives more positive ratings for its support of the development of the COVID-19 vaccines by pharmaceutical companies, with over half of Americans (55%) saying the Trump administration did an excellent or good job.

Opinions about how the Biden and Trump administrations have handled the vaccine rollout differ by party. Nearly nine-in-ten Democrats (88%) give positive marks for the job the Biden administration is doing; 46% say it has done an excellent job, while 42% say it has done a good job. Republicans offer less positive evaluations; still, a 55% majority says the Biden administration has done an excellent or good job in managing the manufacture and distribution of the vaccine.

In their retrospective views of the Trump administration’s handling of the vaccines, both Republicans and Democrats offer more positive evaluations for how the administration supported the development of vaccines than for how it managed their manufacture and distribution.

Large majorities of Republicans (86% and 83%, respectively) give the Trump administration positive ratings for both supporting the vaccine development and managing its distribution. Yet while a majority of Republicans (54%) say the Trump administration did an excellent job supporting vaccine development, fewer (41%) say it did an excellent job managing the manufacture and distribution of vaccines.

Nearly a third of Democrats (31%) say the Trump administration did an excellent or good job in supporting the development of vaccines by pharmaceutical companies. Just 12% of Democrats say the same about the administration’s management of the vaccine rollout.

Broad public support for coronavirus aid package

Americans approve of the $2 trillion coronavirus economic aid package by a margin of about two-to-one. Two-thirds of the public (67%) approve of the bill, with 36% saying they strongly approve. About one-in-three (32%) of Americans disapprove of the bill (17% strongly).

The legislation draws overwhelming support from Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (93% favor). A smaller majority of Republicans and Republican leaners (65%) oppose the coronavirus aid package. Roughly a third of Republicans (35%) favor the aid package, which received no support from congressional Republicans.

Overall, the demographic divides in support for the aid package are modest and track with the partisan leanings of each group: Women are somewhat more likely than men to say they approve of the bill. Among racial and ethnic groups, White Americans support the bill at lower rates than Black, Hispanic and Asian adults. And young people are more likely to approve of the aid package than older people.

Lower income Republicans view the aid package much more positively than do Republicans with higher incomes. A majority of lower income Republicans and Republican leaners (55%) approve of the bill, compared with just 18% of those with the highest family incomes.

Similarly, lower income Republicans are much more likely than other Republicans to say the bill will have a positive impact on their family (43%) and the country as a whole (42%) than those Republicans with the highest incomes (12% and 16% respectively).

Lower income Democrats are somewhat less likely than those with higher incomes to say that the bill will have a positive impact on their families or the country as a whole – though the income divides on the Democratic side are less pronounced than those among Republicans.

Most Americans say they understand how the coronavirus aid package may affect them

A majority of Americans (79%) say feel like they understand how the coronavirus aid package will affect them very or somewhat well, while three-in-ten say they understand its effects very well.

Unlike Americans’ approval of the bill, their reported understanding of the bill is not marked by large partisan divisions. About three-quarters (74%) of Republicans and Republican leaners say they understand the bill at least somewhat well. A slightly larger share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the same (84%).

Public split over how Biden’s economic policies compare with Trump’s

Three months into the new administration, 43% of Americans say that, compared with the Trump administration, the Biden administration’s policies are making the country’s economy stronger, while 36% say Biden’s policies are making the economy weaker and 20% say they are not making much of a difference.

About three-quarters of Republicans (76%) say Biden’s policies are making the country’s economy weaker than the policies of his predecessor. In contrast, about the same share of Democrats (74%) say the new administration’s policies are making the economy stronger when compared with the policies of the previous administration. About two-in-ten in both parties say Biden’s policies aren’t having much of a different effect on the economy than Trump’s did (17% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats say this)."

Halfway through 2021, and about six months into the Biden administration, the U.S. economy has by many metrics made a full recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. One year ago, nationwide business closures sent the unemployment rate climbing to 13.3%. It's now at 5.8%. Average hourly wages are now higher than they were just before the pandemic. The stock market is at record highs, and U.S. consumers are now feeling more confident than at any point in the last 16 months. GDP, which swooned 31.4% in the second quarter of 2020, is expected to top 8% in the second quarter of 2021 and herald a new era of business expansion. So with employment, wages and economic activity up, the S&P 500 reaching new highs, and effective coronavirus vaccines within reach of nearly all U.S. residents, what could possibly derail the Biden economy? The answer to that question, according to some economists, is Biden himself. As the president proposes trillions more spending on top of a historic level of stimulus, the risk is that his administration could overheat the U.S. economy and spark a wild spike in prices. As workers return to the labor force and American consumers rush to spend months of pent-up savings accrued during the pandemic, the risk of overheating is now the greatest hazard for the U.S. economy, said Allen Sinai, chief global economist and strategist at Decision Economics. ""The headwind could be too much of a good thing,"" Sinai said Tuesday. Perhaps paradoxically, ""the headwinds are a consequence of the tail winds,"" he continued. ""In the rush to cushion and save the economy, was too much stimulus supplied?""

Having learned from the mistakes of the financial crisis more than 10 years ago, federal lawmakers and the Federal Reserve moved quickly in March 2020 to flush the economy with stimulus. While Congress and former President Donald Trump worked to pass the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, the Fed slashed interest rates and embarked on a historic effort to flood financial markets with cash by buying billions in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds each month. But with the markets and American consumers acting as if the Covid pandemic is over, and with the Biden administration lobbying for another trillion dollars for infrastructure, the stage could be set for inflation beyond the Fed's control. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Good report card

By most economic metrics, U.S. workers and businesses have staged a robust recovery from the pandemic thanks in large part to an unprecedented policy response by both the Trump and Biden administrations. The 46th president's critical priorities were on full display in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Democrats ushered through Congress in March. The Biden relief bill not only authorized billions in additional funding for vaccine deployment, but also refreshed direct economic support in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks and an extension of enhanced jobless benefits. Thus far, those programs appear to have worked to help the economy accelerate in the second quarter. While total employment is still below pre-pandemic levels, U.S. employers have added back more than 2 million jobs since Biden took office and are expected to narrow that gap further in the coming months. Wages are up 2% over the last year.

The Labor Department's upcoming jobs report, due out Friday, is expected to show that employers added a strong 706,000 positions in June and that average hourly earnings rose 3.6% over the last year, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. ""A lot is going well. I think that the stimulus package really did its job. Trump had a good one, and then Biden had a good one,"" said Fundstrat Global Advisors policy analyst Tom Block. ""The jobs numbers, while they haven't been as big as some would have liked, are pretty darn good. They're moving in the right direction."" Reports from corporate America are also upbeat. With the first-quarter earnings season over, 86% of S&P 500 companies reported earnings results that were better than expected, the most in any quarter since at least 2008, when FactSet first began measuring. The second quarter is already shaping up well for C-suite executives: A record-high number of S&P 500 companies have issued positive earnings and sales guidance for the three months ending June 30, according to FactSet earnings analyst John Butters. The S&P 500, up a dizzying 14% in six months, closed at another record high on Tuesday. The Atlanta Federal Reserve, which tracks data in real time to estimate changes in gross domestic product, expects GDP to grow at an 8.3% annualized pace for the second quarter. Like any president, Biden hasn't been shy on sharing news about a hot economy. ""The bottom line is this: The Biden economic plan is working,"" the president said in late May. ""We've had record job creation, we're seeing record economic growth, we're creating a new paradigm. One that rewards work — the working people in this nation, not just those at the top.""

The president pushed lawmakers to move forward with the spending proposals, arguing the plans will tackle some of the most persistent economic challenges the country faces as the country continues to recover from the pandemic.

""This is the best strategy to create millions of jobs and lift up middle class families, and grow wages and keep prices affordable for the long-term,"" Mr. Biden said.

Last month, the economy added 850,000 jobs, after two months of lower growth than economists had anticipated. The number of people filing for unemployment claims for the first time last week hit its lowest number since the pandemic began in March 2020, another sign of the economy slowly recovering. During his remarks, Mr. Biden touted the creation of 3 millions jobs since he entered office and praised the passage of the American Rescue Plan in March.

""The U.S. is the only developed country in the world where growth projections today are stronger than they were before the pandemic hit,"" Mr. Biden said. He claimed his administration brought the country ""back from the brink.""

But the president warned the United States cannot be complacent. He urged Americans to get vaccinated.

At the same time, the president is promoting a nearly $600 billion bipartisan infrastructure framework being negotiated by a group of senators that focuses predominantly on transportation and broadband. At the same time, Democrats are working on a budget resolution for a roughly $3.5 trillion package that will address some of Mr. Biden's other top priorities, including education, child care and climate change.

Mr. Biden also directly pushed back on Republican arguments that his spending agenda would only fuel inflation. The president argued rising prices are expected to be temporary as the economy reopens.

""My administration understands that if we were ever to experience unchecked inflation over the long term, that would pose a real challenge to our economy,"" Mr. Biden said. ""So while we're confident that isn't what we're seeing today, we're going to remain vigilant about any response that is needed.""

The president said the spending will boost productivity and wages. He argued it would actually take pressure off inflation and claimed those whose primarily concern is inflation should be ""even more enthusiastic"" about the plans.

Last week, Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, announced he will file cloture on Monday, paving the way for the bipartisan infrastructure bill to move forward. An initial vote could come on Wednesday as lawmakers move to finalize the agreement. However, some Republican lawmakers expressed concern that setting a Wednesday deadline, saying the goal is to get it right. Some key aspects of the infrastructure bill are still being worked out.

On Sunday, Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio revealed that one provision to help pay for infrastructure, providing the IRS with additional funding to track down on tax enforcement, would not be part of the agreement.

""One reason it's not part of the proposal is that we did have pushback,"" Portman told CNN. ""Another reason is that we found out that the Democrats were going to put a proposal into the reconciliation package which was not just similar to the one we had, but with a lot more IRS enforcement.""

Initially, the infrastructure framework included $40 billion in additional funding for the IRS. The Biden administration wanted $80 billion total for the IRS over 10 years to help the agency crack down on tax avoidance. The Treasury Department estimated that the so-called tax gap, or the difference between what is owed and what was actually paid, will reach $7 trillion over the next decade. Mr. Biden has argued it's time for the largest corporations and wealthy Americans to pay their fair share. On Monday, Biden said spending would be paid for responsibly.

Portman said Sunday it was important that the infrastructure bill be paid for, and additional meetings were held over the weekend to discuss.

Schumer also said he wanted Democratic lawmakers to reach an agreement by Wednesday on the budget resolution. It's set to include provisions such as extending the enhanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments, paid family leave, universal pre-K for three and four-year-olds, making college more affordable and spending on clean energy."

July 26, 2021

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is banking on the idea of making life more affordable for middle-class families — and that’s where the recent bout of inflation poses both a political and an economic risk.

The U.S. economy may be poised for the fastest growth since 1984, but many Americans are not feeling all that confident about the economy, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Republican lawmakers have attacked the Biden administration over inflation as the country reopened from the coronavirus pandemic, and feelings about the economy are settling along partisan lines.

Fewer than half, 45%, judge the economy to be in good shape, while 54% say it’s in poor shape. Views are similar to what they were in AP-NORC polls in June and in March, despite increases in vaccinations and the flow of aid from Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. The results suggest that Americans not only filter their thoughts about the economy through their politics but also see uncertainty as the country is still 6.8 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels.

John Novak, a 52-year-old school maintenance worker from Hudson, Wisconsin, is tired of seeing higher gasoline prices and six-month waits to buy a refrigerator. He blames the size of the aid package.

“Everything just costs more, and no one’s really making more other than if you get government money, which I did get some, but I’d rather have prices lower,” said Novak, who voted for President Donald Trump last year. “It’s a tough spot. We’re kind of coming out of this pandemic and then when you pour too much money in you just can’t get enough of what you want.”

The Biden administration is keenly aware that inflation is a potent weapon that could be used politically against Democrats. While pledging to stay vigilant against price increases, officials say that the recent burst reflects the complex nature of restarting an economy that had been shuttered because of the pandemic and that inflation will only be elevated temporarily as a result.

There are some early signs of inflation lessening as the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index fell during the first 15 days of July. Meanwhile, the economy has been adding nearly 605,000 jobs a month since Biden became president and economic growth is tracking above 7%.

“There’s no better way to contradict false messaging than by posting strong performance,” said Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. “When you’re in the midst of a recovery with these kinds of numbers, I think it makes it harder for people on the other side to paint a false version of reality.”

Still, political identity is infusing views on the economy. About 6 in 10 Democrats call the economy good, while three-quarters of Republicans say conditions are poor.

That spills over to how Americans are judging Biden’s handling of the economy, with 52% approving and 47% disapproving overall. Biden’s approval rating overall is somewhat higher, at 59%, as is his approval rating for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, at 66%.

About 8 in 10 Democrats, but only about 1 in 10 Republicans, approve of Biden on the economy. Republicans are somewhat more likely to approve of Biden’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic (about 3 in 10 do) and even issues like health care and infrastructure (about 2 in 10 do).

Federal Reserve officials have estimated that the economy could grow at roughly 7% this year. But the U.S. central bank is also tasked with keeping inflation at a 2% target, and there are signs that the pressures pushing up prices have yet to fade as there are limited supplies of houses, autos and the raw materials used by many manufacturers.

The solid demand is supposed to lead to additional supply, which can then help inflation ease. But the outlook for inflation that Fed Chair Jerome Powell considers to be temporary has become somewhat more hazy. Consumer prices jumped 5.4% for the year ended in June. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, they’re up 4.5%, the biggest increase since 1991.

“We don’t have another example of the last time we reopened a $20 trillion economy,” Powell told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee this month. “We’re humble about what we understand.”

Joseph Smith, 72 and a retiree in Alexandria, Virginia, said he worries that the constant focus on inflation by Powell and Republicans has been spooking consumers.

“The Fed is sort of hindering the economy by talking about inflation all the time,” said Smith, who supported Biden last year and feels the president has brought “real stability” to the government with his straight talk on the coronavirus and the economy.

Republican lawmakers have blamed Biden’s spending for the inflation and say his plans for another $4.1 trillion in new spending to be paid for through taxes on the wealthy and corporations will only cause prices to keep rising. They frame it as a return to the runaway price increases of the 1970s, even though economists who are concerned about inflation say that’s not the case. But the message is connecting with Republican voters.

“As Joe Biden’s inflation crisis rages, he just can’t stop fueling it with more reckless government spending,” said Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “Americans are experiencing 1970s-style inflation again, and it’s because of Joe Biden’s failed economic policies.”

Those kinds of criticisms are being echoed by voters in a sign of the challenge before Biden as he tries to broaden the appeal of his policies.

Gregory Holman, 58, a hotel property manager in Grants Pass, Oregon, said he couldn’t find an affordable used car. He said it was the fault of too much government spending and graded Biden accordingly.

“I’d give him an F,” Holman said. “He’s just a failure at everything he does.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,308 adults was conducted July 15-19 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points."

Summers, a Democrat who has been openly critical of his economic agenda, to acknowledge Summers’s concerns and ask him to explain his objections, according to three people with knowledge of the private exchange. Biden made the call as the White House is weighing critical decisions on the economy, including how much and whether to trim a far-reaching infrastructure plan in response to Republican demands. The conversation also unfolded against the backdrop of warnings from Summers and others that Biden’s spending plans present a risk of inflation and an overheating economy.

The White House has downplayed the extent of the threat posed by inflation, arguing it will likely be transitory and manageable if necessary by the Federal Reserve. But in recent months, Summers has engaged in increasingly bitter disagreements with White House aides.

Summers — a treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, top economic adviser to President Barack Obama and former president of Harvard University — is a prominent Democratic voice on economic matters. But he has also become a nemesis of the party’s left flank, which sees him as representative of a misguided centrism that Democrats have moved beyond.

Summers has been warning that Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package is too big and will overheat the economy, spurring inflation that could prove hard for the Federal Reserve to control. White House officials have routinely dismissed Summers’s concerns and in private express frustration with his attacks, which have bolstered Republican criticisms of the administration.

The Biden-Summers phone call, which has not been previously reported, occurred late last month, according to three people with knowledge of the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conversation. Summers, a contributing Washington Post columnist, declined to comment.

A White House official said Biden seeks “a wide spectrum of views” and the call was “brief and informal.” The official said it took place before the president gave a speech in Cleveland on Friday, in which he laid out his economic vision.

""The president has a large network and has spoken to a number of voices with economic expertise outside of the administration, including many with whom he has disagreements,” the official said.

The White House noted that Biden has spoken frequently with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a leader of the party’s liberal wing, as well as numerous labor leaders.

After passing the covid relief plan with no Republican votes in Congress, the White House is now focused on pushing another $4 trillion in spending on a mixture of infrastructure, education and other domestic priorities. Officials say they will pay for these plans through tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy, but Republicans are opposed to such tax increases.

Summers has broadly cheered Biden’s infrastructure package, but has issued a warning that lawmakers should regard inflation as “the primary risk” to the U.S. economy.

Late last month, Summers urged policymakers to pay for new infrastructure spending in part by repurposing unspent money from the covid stimulus, an approach endorsed by congressional Republicans but thus far rejected by the White House. Summers also said policymakers should consider letting unemployment benefits expire sooner than the current deadline of September — another recommendation the administration has not considered.

And he has challenged “Made in America” requirements — a centerpiece of Biden’s jobs package — as potentially exacerbating economic problems by driving up prices and fueling labor shortages. “I think this is the least responsible macroeconomic policy we’ve had in the last 40 years,” Summers told Bloomberg News as the stimulus package was passing.

The White House has shown some sensitivity to the inflationary concerns raised by Summers, but aides say current price spikes largely reflect the economy snapping back from its pandemic lows, not a long-term problem or an indictment of Biden’s policies.

New data from the U.S. Census Bureau suggest that the stimulus plans passed last December and again this spring helped dramatically reduce poverty and hunger in the United States. At the same time, short-term bottlenecks, exacerbated by surging demand, have driven up the cost of lumber, food, gasoline and other commodities.

Biden himself last week praised the goal of “full employment,” and administration officials note that an urgent need for labor has prompted employers to bid up wages for the first time in decades.

But the stark warnings from a figure like Summers are difficult for the White House to ignore, and officials have pushed back publicly.

“With respect to Larry in his piece, it’s just flat-out wrong that our team is ‘dismissive of inflationary risks,’ ” Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in February after one Summer article. “Janet Yellen is our treasury secretary. She knows a little something about inflationary risks.” Yellen is a former chair of the Federal Reserve.

Republicans, however, have seized on Summers’s unease with the Biden agenda, gleefully highlighting his position as an elder statesman of Democratic economic policy.

“He said at the beginning of the year that the previous package, the so-called rescue package, would create a wave of inflation. And only this week, he reiterated that happened just as he predicted,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said last week.

The dispute between Summers and the administration is unusually personal. Beyond his contact with Biden — who he occasionally advised during the 2020 presidential campaign — Summers has extensive ties to senior White House economic personnel. Brian Deese, the head of the National Economic Council, served as a close aide to Summers during the Obama administration, when Summers ran the NEC.

Summers is also close friends with Gene Sperling, who is overseeing the implementation of the stimulus package, and he served as an adviser to Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the Council on Economic Advisers, when she was in graduate school.

Summers’s inflation argument “was what a lot of people were saying privately, what was being whispered by people without his voice or without his platform who were nervous about going public,” Jason Furman, who was Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers chair, told The Post in March.

But liberals close to the administration have urged the White House to tune out his commentary. They point to Summers’s role in the Obama recovery, which led to only tepid economic growth and which many Democratic officials now believe contributed to historic electoral losses for the party.

“Larry has gone unchallenged for decades. It’s time for other people to lead. The old models are out of place,” said Claudia Sahm, a former economist at the Federal Reserve who is supportive of Biden’s stimulus package. “You could say Larry Summers suffers from a skills gap in the current environment.”

Summers and Biden have operated in overlapping circles for decades. As deputy treasury secretary, Summers testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden served as a member in the 1990s. They later worked together as the Obama administration tried to pull the nation out of the Great Recession, at one point jointly traveling to Michigan to tout the rescue package."

Michelle Bennett is trying to keep life inside her Waldorf, Maryland, home as normal as possible during Covid-19. Three of her four daughters are learning remotely, while she makes them three meals a day. But outside, the relentless threat of eviction keeps knocking.

She lost her job as a receptionist at a doctors’ office in March and hasn’t been able to collect unemployment because she is waiting to be approved for disability. It’s by the grace of a court-ordered stay that she can remain in her home while she fights the eviction through appeal.

“I’m basically living in fear because I don’t want to be homeless,” said Michelle Bennett. “I don’t really have anywhere to go without an income during the pandemic.”

The eviction crisis is just one of the economic disasters the Biden administration needs to tackle – it’s also staring down massive unemployment and a growing hunger problem. Even with the proposition of a historic $1.9 trillion relief package, President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle to get the economy back to where it was before the pandemic.

Last week, Biden signed an executive order extending a ban on evictions through the end of March. Despite the ban, it doesn’t help Bennett, whose lawyer says her landlord is using a legal loophole that is growing common during the pandemic.

Bennett is a month-to-month tenant and failure to pay rent means she has technically outstayed her lease. Landlords are filing evictions as “tenant hold overs” – when renters remain in a property after the lease expires. Many judges are ruling in favor of the landlords despite the extenuating circumstances and federal and state evictions bans, according to Maryland Legal Aid.

“A loophole has been created that allows landlords to continue evicting tenants that cannot pay rent” said Nicole Portnov, a lawyer with Maryland Legal Aid, representing Bennett. “Ms. Bennett is a quintessential example of this phenomenon, and in Ms. Bennett’s case this has led to the use of a relatively seldom used eviction statute to put people in the street during a pandemic.”

An Emergency Rental Assistance program was created under the Trump administration to help renters like Bennett, but she says she was unable to apply because the funds dried up.

“When you call it’s like – no money. Or call back next month, maybe there’ll be money then. And then you call back the next month is still ‘oh we’re out of money,’” said Bennett.

President Biden proposed about $30 billion in additional rental assistance to renters and small landlords as part of his Covid-19 relief plan. He also wants to extend the eviction moratorium until the end of September.

“I’m not asking for a handout, I’m just trying to keep me and my kids together,” said Bennett, who has not been able to find another job. “We’re in a FEMA like situation – we don’t have a flood or hurricane – but were in a pandemic.”

Women in the hospitality industry hit hardest

Weekly unemployment claims are hovering near 1 million. Last month, the economy shed jobs for the first time since April, and women were hit the hardest: Of the total, a net 156,000 jobs were lost by women, and 16,000 were gained by men.

“It’s maddening, it’s frustrating, it’s defeating,” said Gabbie Riley.

In March, Riley was furloughed from her sales job at the Loews Hotel in Minneapolis, with the hope it would return. The leisure and hospitality industry has lost more jobs than any other US industry since the pandemic began.

“I don’t know how I can describe it. I was the one that put in the work…and to know that I just had to hand that off to the men is a lot to process,” said Riley who detailed her story in op-ed for CNN the day before she found out she was laid off.

As a single mother, Riley can no longer afford health insurance for her and her 19 year-old son. She’s on unemployment, but says her savings is keeping her family afloat.

As part of his Covid-19 relief plan, Biden plans to extend enhanced unemployment benefits, increasing them from $300 a week to $400. But what Riley really wants is her career back.

“Two years ago this week, I was accepting an award in front of 500 people for the ‘Hotel Rep of the Year - East’ - earned from industry client and peer nominations and voting. This year I am unemployed trying to figure out what comes next. A total 180,” she said.

Food banks are out of money

On a recent Friday afternoon, the line for food at The Campaign Against Hunger in Brooklyn, New York, stretched down a city block. The scene repeats seven days a week.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, this Brooklyn food bank alone has served 1.4 million people – made possible, in part, from government funding that is drying up fast.

“I don’t know what I’m going to do because I still have food to buy,” said Melony Samuels, Executive Director of The Campaign Against Hunger. “I need assurance from all our policymakers that listen, you started, we need to finish this thing. We started helping families, we can’t leave them in thin air.”

Last week, President Biden signed an executive order addressing the growing hunger crisis by asking the Department of Agriculture to increase the value of special pandemic food stamp benefits 15%. The extra benefit gives money to low-income families to cover the cost of missing meals in school. But as the need for food grows, many Americans will fall through the cracks.

“Many people are not eligible for SNAP (food stamps), but they’re here because they’re not eligible and they still cannot make ends meet,” said Samuels. “SNAP needs to be fixed and money needs to be in the budget directly to food pantries, food banks that are actually working on the ground.”

""The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition,"" Mr. Biden said in remarks on Friday afternoon. ""Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation.""

Mr. Biden insisted that ""competition works,"" and had led to the U.S. becoming the ""wealthiest and most innovative nation in history."" A White House fact sheet says the order to ""promote competition in the American economy"" will ""lower prices for families, increase wages for workers, and promote innovation and even faster economic growth.""

The executive order establishes ""a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy,"" the fact sheet says. ""The Order includes 72 initiatives by more than a dozen federal agencies to promptly tackle some of the most pressing competition problems across our economy.""

The wide-ranging order includes initiatives to ban or limit non-compete agreements, lower prescription drug prices, allow hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter, and make internet access more affordable by banning excessive early termination fees and ending landlord internet service provider exclusivity arrangements. It would also limit manufacturers from prohibiting self-repairs of their products, making it easier and cheaper to fix items, and require banks to allow customers to take their financial transaction data with them to a competitor.

The order also ""encourages the leading antitrust agencies to focus enforcement efforts on problems in key markets and coordinates other agencies' ongoing response to corporate consolidation,"" the fact sheet says. This would involve directing the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to ""enforce the antitrust laws vigorously,"" and establishing a White House Competition Council led by the director of the National Economic Council.

The order does not impose the will of the White House directly, but instead encourages different agencies to take action. For example, it urges the Surface Transportation Board to require railroad track owners to provide rights of way to passenger rail, and ask the Federal Maritime Commission to enforce rules against shippers charging American exporters high fees.

""The overarching objective with the executive order is to make sure the President is encouraging competition in industries around the country,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday.

New sheriffs in town

The Biden administration's staffing choices have signaled its commitment to tighter antitrust enforcement, in particular the focus on what some experts contend are anticompetitive practices by Amazon, Facebook and other Big Tech companies. New FTC Chair Lina Khan is a prominent critic of the technology industry, having previously led the House Antitrust subcommittee's investigation into the power of so-called Big Tech companies. The panel's 2020 report detailed a range of anticompetitive practices and accused Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google of stifling competition, charging ""exorbitant"" fees and eroding democracy.

As a student at Yale Law School, Khan in 2017 also authored an influential paper, titled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,"" that charged the online retailer with predatory pricing and, more broadly, made a case for stiffening antitrust enforcement.

Other White House economic advisers are also seen as favoring tougher antitrust rules. Columbia law professor Tim Wu, a special assistant to Mr. Biden on tech and competition with the National Economic Council, has long raised concerns about the size and dominance of big companies, including in a 2018 book ""The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age."" And Heather Boushey, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, is a co-founder of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive think tank that advocates for stronger antitrust regulations.

More ""skepticism"" toward mergers?

One immediate impact of the White House's focus on bolstering competition could be a tougher regulatory road for large mergers and heightened federal scrutiny of industry consolidation.

Khan and Richard Powers, the Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in a joint statement after Mr. Biden announced his executive order that the agencies plan to review their merger guidelines. Those principles should encourage regulators to review mergers with the ""skepticism the law demands,"" they said.

On Wall Street, analysts trying to assess the potential repercussions for investors of Mr. Biden's order expect his administration to push hard to rein in Big Tech and other dominant companies.

""The Biden administration's antitrust team is mostly in place and preparing for a significant ramp up in regulatory scrutiny over the coming months and years,"" analysts with investment bank Raymond James said in a report on Friday. ""The market will especially be watching the tech space and signs point to regulators, as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill, keeping the most dominant tech platforms in their sights in the near to medium term."""

The event, which gathered together 40 world leaders, along with business executives, labor union heads and academics, underscored what appears to be the Biden administration’s strategy: Try to convince the political middle that Biden can deliver economic benefits with an agenda of creating jobs tied to combating climate change, and hope the rest of the world will go along with him.

On Friday, Biden repeatedly sought to persuade participants from organized labor, the business world, heads of state and anyone else who was listening that “We can do this,” despite the heavy lift ahead.

And a heavy lift it is: Even with new pledges by the United States and other countries announced this week, experts calculate that the world is still far off track for closing the “emissions gap” and putting the planet on track to achieve a carbon neutral economy by 2050, fending off the worst effects of climate change.

“I hope we don’t lose focus here, lose a sense of how much we can do together, by helping ourselves,” Biden said in his concluding remarks. “We’re helping ourselves, we are helping others.”

Friday’s theme, “the economic opportunities of climate action” was built around other recent Biden initiatives, including his $2 trillion “American Jobs Plan.” If Congress goes along, the proposal would start to remake the nation’s power grid, modernize and weatherize affordable housing and accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, among other climate efforts.

The program on Friday was in part a political sales pitch to lawmakers like Sen. Joe Manchin, the pro-fossil fuel West Virginia Democrat in a Senate divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats. Biden could also appeal to Republicans in states with burgeoning solar and wind industries; lawmakers with a desire for big infrastructure investments back home; and the other countries that will gather in November at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry called that conference, where participating nations will be expected to make deeper commitments on climate action, pivotal to getting the world on track to solving the climate crisis.

A Stress On ‘Tomorrow’s Technologies’

The White House launched the morning’s sessions with a slick, corporate-style promotional video about the need to invest in “tomorrow’s technologies,” including renewable energy, so-called “climate smart agriculture” and carbon capture and storage. It was set to an epic-sounding, soaring cinematic soundtrack.

Technology is perhaps the sole good-news-story of climate change, if there is any at all, because of the economic opportunities it presents, and the Biden administration was eager to highlight the issue. Leaders from Poland, the United Arab Emirates, Norway, Israel and other countries spoke about the benefits they are already reaping from developing clean energy technologies.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said clean energy development represents a $23 trillion market through 2030, and that her department was spurring critical research to fill the need. She announced new U.S. goals to slash the cost of “clean renewable hydrogen” by 80 percent by 2030, an amount she said would make it competitive with natural gas. She also said the department is aiming to halve the cost of batteries, bringing down the price of electric vehicles in the process.

Technologies to capture carbon dioxide emissions or to pull the gas straight from the air could prove critical to meeting climate goals, particularly for eliminating emissions from heavy industry like cement manufacturing.

The technology also represents one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement in Washington—innovation has been the focus of Republican climate proposals—and that is particularly true for capturing carbon emissions. It is also a priority of Manchin’s: The West Virginia senator holds considerable sway over any energy policy as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

His coal-dependent constituents and major labor unions represented at the summit have pressed hard for investments in carbon capture and storage, which could extend the life of some coal power plants if costs are brought down.

Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said nearly half the world’s emissions reductions will need to come from technologies that are not yet commercial. And Granholm made clear that her department was ready to push those technologies to market.

“We need fearless innovation,” she said. “And perhaps most of all, we need a mindset that overcomes resistance to change.”

‘A Welcome Signal of U.S. Leadership’

At home, Biden is walking a political tightrope, with a majority in the Senate only by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris breaking any tie votes, and an opposition party that has been unable or unwilling to develop its own comprehensive climate action plan.

Even as the summit was underway, Biden was facing pushback in Congress from Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, for example, characterized the president’s summit as making “toothless requests of our foreign adversaries,” while attempting to inflict “maximum pain for American citizens”

Republicans again made clear their skepticism about the notion American workers would benefit from Biden’s climate agenda.

At a House hearing on the repeal of government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, a measure the White House wants to include in an infrastructure bill, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) raised concerns about what he called “treating the oil and gas industry differently under the U.S. tax code.” Norman also blasted Biden for reentering the Paris climate agreement, which he said would not hold China accountable for pollution that would far offset any emissions cuts here.

“This does not sound like a good deal for American workers or American energy independence, and puts us at a distinct disadvantage with our global competitors,” Norman said.

Still, world leader after world leader who participated in the summit thanked the United States for reclaiming a leadership role in addressing climate change, one that had been abrogated by former President Donald Trump.

“I would like to thank President Joe Biden for convening this summit,” said Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his presentation Friday. “It is a welcome signal of U.S. leadership and commitment to a multilateral climate solution, underlined by the U.S rejoining the Paris Agreement.”

‘There are No Jobs on a Dead Planet’

Reflecting Biden’s long relationship with unions, organized labor was—as Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate advisor put it—not only at the table at this week’s summit, but was being listened to.

Biden’s Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, told participants that the new energy economy will be a “once in a generation opportunity to develop and produce advanced technologies, export them around the world, and speed global netzero transitions, which will ultimately … lead to the creation of millions of jobs, millions of good, high paying union jobs.”

“Workers are key allies in shaping and moving policies and should not be an afterthought,” said Roxanne Brown, international vice president at large of the United Steelworkers. They need to be “at the center” of discussions about climate solutions, she added.

Unions helped elect Biden, and union jobs were also a key part of the Green New Deal, the resolution from the Democratic Party’s liberal wing that calls for a massive shift in federal spending to create union jobs, build economic justice and hasten a transition to clean energy by 2050.

“We have the technology,” said Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation with 200 million members in 163 countries. “We have the finances to get the job done.”

She added, “There are no jobs on a dead planet. We will work with anybody to build good jobs on a living planet.”

Friday, the Biden administration also released its first report of its Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, with recommendations for creating “good-paying, union jobs” for workers in “hard-hit coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities across the country.” The government group identified nearly $38 billion in existing federal funding that could support energy communities’ infrastructure, environmental remediation, union job creation, and community revitalization efforts.

On Thursday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Biden was right to focus on jobs.

“It is vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive politically correct green act of bunny hugging,” Johnson said. “This is about growth and jobs.”

‘This is a Different Moment’

In summing up his conversations with world leaders at the summit, Kerry said that many countries had emphasized the critical role that the United Nations meetings in Glasgow in November, known as COP26, would play in keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal set in Paris.

“Because we know that we are already at 1.2 degrees, we have a very small margin to play with,” Kerry said.

At COP 26, climate policy experts say they’ll be looking for more specifics from the attending countries, including the United States, as they head into the event.

“I think what we want to see is more countries stepping up with more ambitious targets for 2030,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in an interview. “We need more countries to provide details on how they’re going to meet those targets. By the time we get to COP26, everyone is hoping and expecting that the world is doing what it needs to to get back on track to the Paris agreement.”

Ministers and environmental advocates alike said United States leadership would be critical heading into the November meetings.

“It’s clear that the U.S. has some digging out of a pretty big hole to do after four years,” said Brendan Guy, a strategist specializing in international climate policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, in an interview. But, he added, the climate commitment made by the United States “shows its credibility and is a powerful signal to the international community.”

He added, “It just amplifies the overall ambition, especially for countries that did not bring much to the table at this summit. There’s a lot more pressure in the system now.”

A key piece of the United States’ ability to create momentum going into the event will be persuading other countries that American policy won’t flip-flop with every change in administration. Some experts say, however, that the urgency of the crisis has shifted political and economic momentum.

“The Biden-Harris administration has an unprecedented mandate from voters to act with ambition on climate,” said Matthew Davis, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters. “This is not the same mandate that the Obama-Biden administration had 12 or 8 years ago. This is a different moment and there’s a different level of support now.”

Cleetus, echoing many other experts, applauded the administration’s commitment to cut US emissions in half by 2030 especially for the signal it sends to other countries. “It was really important to hear the administration announce a goal of that magnitude and to show the world they’re back with ambition,” Cleetus said.

Kerry said conversations held at the summit would continue over the next six months.

“Glasgow is the last best hope we have to galvanize the world to move in this direction and get the job done,” Kerry said."

Today’s strong GDP and employment numbers can leave little doubt that the U.S. economy is well on the mend from last year’s Covid-induced recession.

With almost 6 ½ percent GDP growth in the first quarter and with new jobless claims at their lowest level since the pandemic’s onset, there is every prospect that by mid-year the U.S. economy will have regained its pre-pandemic level. There is also every prospect that this year the U.S. economy will experience its strongest boom in the past forty years.

At the same time that the U.S. economy is roaring back to life, U.S. asset prices seem to be on fire. Over the past year, U.S. stock prices have increased by around 85 percent or by their strongest yearly increase on record. Meanwhile, over the past twelve months, U.S. house prices have increased by 12 percent.

Now while the rapid increase in economic growth and employment, as well as buoyant asset prices, are certainly cause for celebration, it has to raise serious questions about the appropriateness of today’s expansive economic policy setting for the attainment of long-run economic prosperity.

With an already strongly recovering economy and with clear signs of froth in equity and housing markets, does the U.S. economy really need the massive amount of budget and monetary policy stimulus that it is now receiving?

Even on its own, the $1.9 trillion budget stimulus that Joe Biden rushed through Congress this Spring would seem to risk overheating the U.S. economy by the end of the year. Coming on top of a generous bipartisan budget stimulus at the end of last year, the Biden stimulus would imply that the U.S. economy will be receiving a staggering 13 percent of GDP in budget stimulus this year. Such stimulus would seem to be excessively large at a time that the Congressional Budget Office is estimating that US output is currently only some 3 percent below its potential level.

Similarly, it might be asked how much sense does it make for the Federal Reserve to still keep its monetary policy pedal to the metal at this juncture? With the economy strongly recovering and with so much budget stimulus and so much pent-up household demand in the economy, might the Fed not be courting inflation by keeping its interest rate at the zero bound and by continuing to purchase $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities each month? As if to underline that risk, as a result of the Fed’s expansionary policy stance, the U.S. broad money supply is now growing at around 30 percent, or at its fastest pace in the past sixty years.

Yet another reason to question the appropriateness of the Fed’s continued monetary policy largesse are the large bubbles that seem to be forming in both the U.S. stock market and the U.S. housing market. U.S. equity valuations are now at their highest levels since the eve of the 1929 stock market crash, while U.S. housing prices are increasing at their fastest pace since the 2006 housing bubble. Continuing to buy bonds at the current rapid pace that the Fed is now doing carries the real risk of further inflating those bubbles.

Unfortunately, neither the Biden Administration nor the Fed is showing any signs of moderating their expansive policy stance anytime soon. Indeed, the Biden Administration is now pushing an Infrastructure Plan and a Family Plan each with price tags of close to a staggering $2 trillion. Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell keeps insisting that the Fed is “not even thinking about thinking about raising interest rates” until it sees clear signs of inflation.

All of this likely means that the U.S. economy and the U.S. asset markets will keep partying in the months immediately ahead as if there were no tomorrow. However, it also likely means that both the U.S. economy and U.S. asset prices will suffer from a nasty hangover when the party comes to an abrupt end once inflation raises its ugly head."

So far, Biden has centered his statecraft on the clash between democracy and autocracy. In his address to Congress late last month, he identified the country’s adversaries as “the autocrats of the world,” vowing that they “will not win the future. We will. America will.” Envisaging a twenty-first-century “battle between the utility of democracies … and autocracies,” Biden has called for a global “Summit for Democracy” to mobilize likeminded countries against illiberal challengers.

This approach may help rally Americans around the flag, but it is a strategic mistake. America’s relations with both China and Russia have tanked since Biden took office. China has rattled sabers over Taiwan. Chinese and US officials spar in public. Russia has issued new military threats against Ukraine. The United States and the Kremlin exchange sanctions and expel each other’s diplomats.

Given their differing interests, significant tension in US-Chinese and US-Russian relations is inevitable. But the recent escalation of hostility raises the risk of a nasty diplomatic rupture or worse, and blocks necessary cooperation on shared challenges such as climate change, global health, nuclear proliferation, and the management of an interdependent world economy.

It will be very difficult for the US to collaborate with China and Russia on virtually any issue if US grand strategy focuses on taking down illiberal powers. Instead of launching ideological salvos, the Biden administration should devise calibrated responses to the discrete threats posed by China and Russia while also pursuing pragmatic teamwork with them.

With respect to China, the US and its allies should push back against its unfair trade practices, repatriate critical supply chains and maintain an edge in key technological domains, and counter growing Chinese military capabilities. On Russia, the goal should be to check and sanction the Kremlin’s military expansionism, cyberattacks, and interference in foreign elections. And, more broadly, all democracies should denounce violations of political and human rights wherever they occur.

But in a world that is irreversibly globalized and interdependent, confronting clear and present dangers should not entail drawing a new ideological fault line. Even if containment worked against the Soviet Union in the Cold War, a with-us-or-against-us strategy will not deliver the same results today. With an economy that topped out at roughly three-fifths the size of that of the US, the Soviet Union never came close to developing the wherewithal to outpace its democratic challengers. Its sclerotic socialism and coercive alliances crippled its economy and weakened its global appeal.

It’s not so with China, whose GDP will soon surpass and then far exceed that of the US. With its competent top-down political and economic governance, technological prowess, sizeable foreign investment, and ambitious diplomatic outreach (including large-scale exports of its own COVID-19 vaccine), China already enjoys substantial global sway. There is no going back to the decoupled, two-bloc global order of the Cold War.

In this emerging world, democratic governance will still retain its intrinsic advantage: humans prefer freedom. But for the first time since its emergence as a global power in the 1940s, the US now faces in China a full-spectrum competitor. And because the US needs China’s help to rein in North Korea, arrest global warming, and tackle other transnational issues, it had better start mapping out a strategy that is not just about “us versus them.”

Premising US policy on a clash between democracy and autocracy would not just fail to contain China. Worse, it would actually encourage China’s recalcitrance by consolidating its unholy alliance with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. China and Russia have been rivals historically, and China’s rise should naturally alarm the Kremlin. But the two autocracies have instead formed a marriage of convenience to resist what they see as the West’s encroaching ambition.

Rather than pushing Russia and China together, the US should wean Russia off its cozy alignment with China. Just as the US reached out to China in the 1970s to weaken the communist bloc, Biden and his European allies should try to lure Russia westward. Biden’s expressed openness to a summer meeting with Putin is a step in the right direction. Though finding common ground will not be easy, the US has an impressive record of working with unsavory regimes when it chooses to do so.

Should Biden continue to circle the ideological wagons, he also risks weakening, rather than strengthening, solidarity among the world’s democracies. After all, it is not as though America’s European and Asian partners are spoiling for a fight with China. This past December, the European Union finalized an investment treaty with China, despite the incoming Biden administration’s objections (though ratification by the European Parliament remains uncertain). Similarly, South Korea, Japan, and other Asian democracies in China’s neighborhood are not interested in a blustery confrontation. Biden would be wise not to force US allies to make stark choices.

America’s own founders counseled patience and restraint in foreign policy. The US has long been able to rely on the power of its example to bring other countries into the democratic fold. It should now return to this long game. The best way for democracies to spread their values is to get their own houses in order, so that they can ultimately prevail against illiberal powers by outperforming them. The US and its democratic allies should continue to face down the threats posed by autocracies; but they must also reserve a place for cooperation on global challenges."

President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a set of actions intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from cars and trucks, moves that would reduce planet-warming emissions from the No. 1 sector contributing to climate change in the U.S.

Biden signed an executive order setting a goal that half of all new vehicles sold by 2030 are zero emissions vehicles, specifically electric vehicles powered by batteries or fuel cells or hybrid-electric vehicles.

Biden pitched the goal to dramatically increase electric vehicle sales as a way for the U.S. to claim a bigger share of that market and the manufacturing jobs from increasing demand for electric vehicles and components like batteries, as well as a big step toward his climate goals to dramatically reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions. He said electric vehicles are like a ""vision of the future now beginning to happen"" and there's no turning back.

""The question is whether we'll lead or fall behind in the race for the future. It’s whether we'll build these vehicles and the batteries that got them to where they are in the United States -- here in the United States, or we’re going to have to rely on other countries for those batteries,"" Biden said in remarks on the White House South Lawn with electric vehicles staged behind him in a White House driveway.

After signing the order, he ran over to a Jeep Wrangler 4xe, took off his suit jacket, got behind the wheel and took the electric SUV for a short spin.

Sales of electric vehicles have lagged in the U.S. compared to growing popularity in China and Europe in recent years. Electric vehicles represent about 2% of new cars sold in the U.S. in each of the past three years, according to data from the International Energy Agency

Biden argued an investment in electric vehicle production through the infrastructure plan will create blue-collar jobs and repeated an argument that has been a theme of his presidency that combating climate change can also be a source of economic growth for the country.

""Beyond the devastation of the lives and livelihoods and the health of our very planet, when I hear climate, I think jobs. Good paying union jobs,"" he said, before an audience of union officials and members of Congress, including Michigan's congressional delegation.

""I want the world to see there was a consensus or an inflection point in world history,"" he said. ""If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of good paying jobs and raise the standard of living for people not only here, but around the world. I also wanted to put the world on notice. America is back. America is back. We're in the competition for the 21st century, the future that will be built right here in America.""

Automakers Ford, GM and Stellantis endorsed the move in a statement Wednesday night, saying they aim for 40-50% of all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric. They also said that goal can only be met with resources to expand electric charging stations that it part of Biden's proposed infrastructure plan.

""With the (United Auto Workers) at our side in transforming the workforce and partnering with us on this journey, we believe we can strengthen continued American leadership in clean transportation technology through electric vehicle innovation and manufacturing,"" the companies said in a joint statement. ""We look forward to working with the Biden Administration, Congress and state and local governments to enact policies that will enable these ambitious objectives.""

The administration is also announcing fuel efficiency standards that will more than reverse the rollback of the clean car standards under former President Donald Trump. A senior administration official said the administration will build on higher fuel efficiency standards set by California the senior official said will ultimately save 200 billion gallons of gasoline and reduce 2 billion metric tons of carbon pollution, according to the senior official.

The standards would require vehicles to reach the equivalent of at least 52 miles per gallon by 2026, making it the strictest emissions standard ever set for cars and trucks. Transportation makes up 29% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and the Environmental Protection Agency says the standard would avoid 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

Climate advocates praised the emissions standards as a critical step to reducing carbon emissions and meeting the goals to limit the impacts of climate change as much as possible.

""The importance of these new vehicle emission standards is hard to overstate. Along with the infrastructure investments currently under consideration in Congress, these standards will be among the most impactful measures that the Biden administration can take to address the climate crisis,"" Dan Lashof, president of the World Resources Institute said in a statement.

""Transportation is now America’s number one source of carbon pollution, so these new emission rules will be a primary tool to achieving the United States’ commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.""

Those rules will still need to go through a formal rule-making process at Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation.

Former President Barack Obama issued similar fuel efficiency standards meant to require new gas-powered vehicles to use less gasoline, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from cars and trucks. Under Trump the EPA relaxed those standards, prompted a legal battle between the administration and California over more stringent goals set by the state.

At least environmental group was unimpressed with Biden's announcement.

""This proposal delivers less carbon pollution reductions than the Obama-era standards and must be strengthened by eliminating excessive giveaways to the industry,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement.

The executive order — which contains 72 initiatives — is striking in its scope and ambition, challenging the business practices of America’s enormous technology, health-care, agricultural and manufacturing firms while also aiming to shake up smaller sectors dominated by only a handful of companies, such as the hearing aid industry.

“The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition,” Biden said in remarks before signing the order, accompanied by several members of his Cabinet. “…Competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing. Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world’s greatest force for prosperity and growth.”

The effort reflects a major change in Democratic policymaking circles, where a new generation of economists has produced research and advocacy arguing that corporate consolidation has harmed workers and consumers. It also tees up a major challenge for the administration, which is likely to face sharp resistance from businesses that may seek relief through courts that have shown skepticism about competition arguments in the past.

Late last month, for instance, a federal court threw out antitrust cases brought against Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.

What’s more, many big companies have only grown in power in the past 18 months, as size became a major asset in navigating the financial and economic turbulence of the coronavirus pandemic.

The executive order identifies a wide range of sectors that it says are in need of reform.

It encourages federal regulators to craft new rules on tech companies’ data collection and user surveillance practices, targeting the path that such giants as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon took to dominance. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Biden wants to reduce broadband providers’ market control by restoring net neutrality rules that were dropped during the Trump administration and limiting their ability to cut exclusive deals with landlords.

The order also tells the Food and Drug Administration to work toward allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and calls for new rules limiting “noncompete” agreements, which prevent employees from switching jobs.

Other recommendations include compelling airlines to disclose “add-on fees” for seating and baggage and making it easier for consumers to get refunds on flights, as well as requiring banks to let customers take their financial transaction data when they switch to a competitor. The order also aims to allow hearing aids to be sold over the counter, which Biden said Friday would save consumers hundreds of dollars.

Perhaps the most impactful part of the order relates to Silicon Valley. It recommends greater scrutiny of acquisitions by major tech companies, especially those of nascent rivals. That focus comes after the Federal Trade Commission brought an antitrust complaint against Facebook last year challenging its purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram. A federal judge last month dismissed that suit, but the FTC can refile it within 30 days.

FTC Chair Lina Khan, who appeared beside Biden as he signed the order, and Richard A. Powers, the acting chief of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said Friday that they would launch a joint review of merger guidelines, with the goal of making them more rigorous.

“The current guidelines deserve a hard look to determine whether they are overly permissive,” they said in a joint statement.

The order also calls on the FTC to set new rules to combat “unfair competition” in online marketplaces. Critics have raised concerns about the dual role that tech companies like Amazon and Apple play as marketplace operators and participants within them, competing with smaller retailers or app developers. Congressional investigators in a report last year called out Amazon’s relationship with third-party sellers, accusing the company of exploiting its access to their data and information.

The Biden administration also wants to see new guidelines on surveillance and the accumulation of data in the wake of major privacy scandals involving data held by Facebook and other tech titans. The order also encourages the restoration of Obama-era net neutrality rules, which require Internet providers to treat all Web traffic equally. And it calls on the Federal Communications Commission to revive plans to implement a “broadband nutrition label,” which would make clearer how much people are paying for Internet service.

Khan, a prominent tech critic, took the helm of the FTC last month, which suggests some directives are likely to be issued. However, key vacancies in other top tech regulation roles may impede implementation of the order. Biden has yet to name someone to run the Justice Department’s antitrust division or install an FCC chair. The FCC currently is deadlocked, with two Democratic commissioners and two Republicans.

The order does not itself put these policies into effect, and none will be enacted overnight. Instead, it directs federal agencies to begin work on their own rules, a process that probably would lead to a comment period, which experts say can take three or four months. The administration also is issuing only recommendations to independent agencies crucial to much of the antitrust push, such as the FTC, that are not subject to directives from the White House.

The FTC probably can limit noncompetes only “on the margins,” diminishing its effectiveness, but Biden’s support bolsters bipartisan legislation on the matter currently moving through Congress, said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy organization. “This is just a first step,” Lettieri said.

An issue once confined to the liberal fringe, antitrust policy has entered the center of political life and played a major role in the 2020 Democratic presidential race amid increasing concerns about the political and economic clout of a handful of private actors.

The White House’s executive order states that 75 percent of U.S. industries are more consolidated than they were 20 years ago. That, officials say, has helped triple prices for many household necessities, while making it harder for workers to bargain against competing employers for better wages and benefits.

A growing body of evidence has pointed to corporate consolidation as a culprit in persistently stagnant wages and the decline of the American middle class. A 2018 study in the Harvard Law Review found that median compensation for workers would be as much as $10,000 higher if markets were less concentrated. A University of Chicago paper in 2016 found that the decline in workers’ share of corporate income is largely tied to increasing corporate consolidation.

“This represents a massive change in how mainstream Democrats are thinking about the economy. It identifies concentrated corporate power — something both parties previously encouraged — as actually contributing to a broad range of harms for workers, innovation, prosperity and a resilient democracy overall,” said Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, which supports antitrust efforts.

“This is not a Warren or a Sanders administration, but they have fully embraced the need to take on concentrated corporate power across the economy.”

Conservatives are likely to blast the measure as ineffective and excessive government intervention in private markets. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican budget expert, said the executive order was “all over the place” — pointing to the wide discrepancy in impact between incremental measures, such as limiting excessive broadband fees, and massive changes, such as unwinding prior corporate mergers.

“There’s a presumption of lack of competition but no evidence of it, and we’re going to do something on the presumption — which is not a great way to do business,” Holtz-Eakin said. “They provide no evidence this is going to change quality of competition.”

The Biden administration brought in experts with ties to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party to help spearhead the order, including Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council; Tim Wu, an National Economic Council antitrust advocate; and Hannah Garden-Monheit, a senior policy adviser for the council.

Ramamurti was a senior aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), while Wu is a longtime critic of Big Tech at Columbia University. Council Director Brian Deese also was closely involved in the process.

Business groups are likely to oppose sweeping regulations that emerge from this order. But any new regulations will probably be ironed out within each implementing agency, giving the affected industries time to provide input.

Neil Bradley, chief policy officer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, accused Biden of taking a “government-knows-best approach” with the order. He noted that large and small businesses are both needed for the economy to thrive, and he said the business lobby opposes “centralized government dictates” to plan the economy.

“The Chamber always will applaud efforts to promote small business, and we will vigorously oppose calls for government-set prices, onerous and legally questionable rulemakings, efforts to treat innovative industries as public utilities, and the politicization of antitrust enforcement,” he said in a statement.

Other liberal economic experts are skeptical about the extent to which antitrust and other pro-competition practices will genuinely boost worker power and wages. While acknowledging the importance of antitrust policy, some experts say there’s a need to reverse the decades-long decline in union density among workers — and Biden’s labor agenda, including the Pro Act, is largely stalled in Congress.

“This will do some things — it all seems fine to me — but will it increase wage growth for the bottom fifth of workers? I doubt it,” said Matt Bruenig, founder of the People’s Policy Project, a left-leaning think tank. “The most important thing for workers’ wages is that they are able to coordinate what they’ll be — to do that you need better union laws — and the dynamics of competition within firms is a much less significant factor.”

Parts of the plan won some bipartisan praise Friday. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), a conservative, told KSN-TV that farmers had been hurt by the consolidation of meatpacking plants, adding, “I do think that this executive order is going to help Kansas farmers and ranchers.”

Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the University of Utah, said the executive order reflects growing skepticism of big business. While prominent left-leaning and union-affiliated Democrats have long made campaign talking points out of curbing the abuses of big business, elements within the Republican Party are now increasingly critical of business executives."

""Sometimes the task of government is to make incremental improvements or try to steer the ocean liner two degrees north or south so that, ten years from now, suddenly we're in a very different place than we were,"" he told podcaster Marc Maron in a 2016 interview.

Obama was arguing against using the power of the presidency to affect change too rapidly. If you try to make a hairpin turn with a Carnival cruise ship, you're going to kill a lot of people and destroy a very expensive boat. Instead, Obama believed in making small policy course corrections that would eventually result in enormous societal outcomes like a greener economy and a more inclusive society.

Obama's ocean liner analogy was completely ignored by the Trump Administration, which veered all over the map and sometimes seemed to come up with policies on the fly. And true to the analogy, people did die when Trump exerted erratic control over the ship — recent analysis found that 40% of the United States' COVID deaths were the result of Trump's mismanagement of the pandemic.

Biden's ocean liner

Before his inauguration, most people (myself included) would have predicted that President Joe Biden would subscribe to his former boss's ocean-liner theory of governance — slowly moving government to a more equitable place through steady, incremental change. Those predictions turned out to be entirely wrong.

On March 31st, President Biden delivered an economic speech that represented a clean break from the dominant economic paradigm of the last 40 years. In the speech, Biden laid out an economic vision for America that was a clear refutation of the neoliberal trickle-down economics theory promoted by the Reagan Administration and accepted as truth by every following presidential administration — Democrat or Republican — up until this year.

While the trickle-down philosophy centers corporations and the wealthy as the job-creating, wealth-producing engines of the economy, Biden offered a new understanding of where American prosperity is created. In the speech announcing his infrastructure bills, The American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan, Biden described an economy in which ""we all will do better when we all do well. It's time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out,"" he announced.

""Wall Street didn't build this country,"" Biden said. ""You, the great middle class, built this country."" He declared that his infrastructure plan would ""build a fair economy that gives everybody a chance to succeed—and it's going to create the strongest, most resilient, innovative economy in the world.""

A clean break

The next day, Bloomberg's Peter Coy recognized Biden's speech as a clean break from the past. In his embrace of ""middle out economics,"" Biden, Coy wrote, ""was siding with the populist, liberal wing of the [Democratic] party and implicitly distancing himself from the low-tax, pro-business wing associated with former Treasury secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, among others.""

Advertisement

In his column, Coy says ""Pitchfork Economics"" host Nick Hanauer coined the phrase ""middle-out economics"" with his coauthor Eric Liu in their 2011 book ""The Gardens of Democracy."" ""The Biden administration is the first administration in my lifetime to actually believe that the neoliberal framework is wrong and to advance a counter-narrative and new agenda,"" Hanauer told Coy.

The trickle-down theory

Many of us are familiar with the arguments of neoliberal, trickle-down economics, because they've been unthinkingly repeated by politicians across the political spectrum since the early 1980s: If you raise wages, you get fewer jobs. If you raise taxes, you'll kill business. If you create regulations, you'll strangle economic growth.

American leaders have treated those statements as uncontested gospel. They slashed taxes, deregulated business, and kept wages low in order to push money up to the wealthiest Americans, and they've waited for all that money to come trickling down to ordinary Americans. Four decades later, we can officially declare the experiment to be a disastrous failure. Inequality is dangerously high — in fact, the richest Americans have hoarded 50 trillion dollars that used to go to the paychecks of ordinary Americans.

Middle-out economics

Clearly, it's time for a big new idea, and President Biden is betting on middle-out economics to turn this economy around. But what's at the heart of this bold new strategy? Earlier this month, Hanauer explained to Democracy Journal that middle-out economics is ""centered around the simple idea that the economy is ultimately made out of people, and the better people do the better the economy does; the focus of policymaking therefore should not be on enriching the few, but on improving the lot of the many.""

Hanauer continued, ""When you help the broad population — the middle — become secure and prosperous, you not only have much faster rates of overall economic growth, but also a much more stable and secure democracy.""

By calling for huge investments that directly improve the lives of a majority of Americans, Biden is effectively making a 180-degree turn from the economic policies of the half-dozen presidents who came before him. Some neoliberals argue that this change is too much, too fast. But Biden seems to be confidently following the trail that was blazed by the last president to cast austerity aside and invest in the American people — Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Biden is arguing that America can't survive the kind of economic inequality we're living with today, and that drastic action is necessary to fix the economy before it's too late. Obama's ocean liner analogy, after all, conveniently forgets the lesson of history's most famous ocean liner — the ridiculously luxurious cruise ship holding some of the world's wealthiest people which stayed steadfast on its course in dangerous waters, only to meet a disastrous end. You know the one. You've probably even seen the movie they made about it."

Biden called for a $15 hourly minimum wage during his campaign and has followed through by hitching it to a measure that, among other things, calls for $1,400 stimulus checks and $130 billion to help schools reopen. Biden argues that anyone who holds a full-time job shouldn’t live in poverty, echoing progressives in the Democratic Party who are fully on board with the effort.

“With the economic divide, I mean, I want to see a $15 minimum wage. It should actually be $20,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.

Some Republicans support exploring an increase but are uneasy with $15 an hour. They warn that such an increase could lead to job losses in an economy that has nearly 10 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic began. Moderates such as Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rep. Tom Reed of New York are urging Biden to split off the minimum wage hike from COVID-19 talks and deal with it separately.

“The more you throw into this bucket of COVID relief that’s not really related to the crisis, the more you risk the credibility with the American people that you’re really sincere about the crisis,” Reed said. Including the wage increase, Murkowski said, “complicates politically an initiative that we should all be working together to address.”

The resistance from moderates has left Democrats with a stark choice: Wait and build bipartisan support for an increase or move ahead with little to no GOP backing, potentially as part of a package that can pass the Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote. Democratic leaders appear to be moving toward the latter option, with no guarantee of success. Even if raising the wage can get past procedural challenges, passage will require the support from every Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, which could be a tall order.

Leading the charge is Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who unveiled $15 wage legislation this week with the backing of 37 Senate Democrats. His bill would gradually raise the wage to $15 over a period of five years. The federal minimum is $7.25 and has not been raised since 2009.

Sanders, the incoming chair of the Senate Budget Committee, said it was fine with him if Republicans were not prepared to “come on board.” He said the government needed to pump money into the economy to make sure “people are not working on starvation wages.”

Democrats are moving toward using a tool that allows certain budget-related items to bypass the Senate filibuster — a hurdle requiring 60 votes — and pass with a simple majority. Sanders is confident that a minimum wage increase fits within the allowed criteria for what is referred to in Washington lingo as budget reconciliation, though the Senate parliamentarian has final say on what qualifies.

“As you will recall, my Republican colleagues used reconciliation to give almost $2 trillion in tax breaks to the rich and large corporations in the midst of massive income inequality. They used reconciliation to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 32 million people off the health care they had. They used reconciliation to allow for drilling in the Arctic wilderness,” Sanders said. “You know what? I think we can use reconciliation to protect the needs of working families.”

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Senate as early as next week will begin taking the first steps toward getting the COVID-19 relief bill passed through the budget reconciliation process. The goal would be passage by March.

The latest sign that a $15 minimum wage is popular with voters came in November, when more than 60% of voters in conservative-leaning Florida approved an amendment to the state’s Constitution that will raise the minimum wage there from $8.56 an hour to $15 an hour by 2026.

The House passed legislation to gradually increase the minimum wage in the last Congress, but it went nowhere in the GOP-controlled Senate. Opponents argue that a large increase in the minimum wage would lead many employers to cut the number of workers they have on their payrolls.

A 2019 study from the Congressional Budget Office projected that an increase to $15 an hour would boost the wages of 17 million Americans. An additional 10 million workers making more than $15 an hour would see a boost as well. However, about 1.3 million workers would lose their jobs.

“There’s no question that raising the minimum wage, especially to $15, will put some small businesses out of business and will cost a lot of low-wage workers their jobs,” said Neil Bradley, the chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Bradley said there should be a separate debate on the minimum wage, and while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes $15 an hour, “we’re open to a reasonable increase in the minimum wage and that ought to be a topic of discussion. But, you know, including that in the COVID package just imperils the whole thing.”

Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union, said that increasing the minimum wage would benefit many of the people who have been working on the front lines of the pandemic. That’s why she supports including it in the COVID-19 relief package.

“They’ve been called essential, but they all believe they’ve been treated as expendable or sacrificial because they don’t earn enough to be able to put food on the table and keep themselves and their families safe and healthy,” Henry said.

Henry says nursing home workers, janitors, security guards and home health workers are among the union’s 2 million members.

“The real way to appreciate this work is to raise the minimum wage to $15,” she said.

Most states also have minimum wage laws. Employees generally are entitled to the higher of the two minimum wages. Currently, 29 states and Washington, D.C., have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour."

A year ago today, President Biden entered office with a full agenda: a pledge not only to fight the pandemic and support economic recovery, but also to rebuild our economy to produce long-term and more widely-shared growth.

The President was inaugurated amidst a still-raging pandemic and a weak economic recovery. A year later, thanks to the rescue efforts of the Biden Administration, millions of Americas have protection from the worst of COVID-19, businesses have been able to resume activity, and children are back at their school desks. Economic recovery has been strong, with sharp increases in employment and GDP, alongside projected reductions in child poverty.

The Administration has not only succeeded in shepherding the economy through the pandemic ups-and-downs to date, but also in laying the foundation for future economic growth. Millions of workers and businesses have avoided the economic scarring so typical of severe recessions. Combined with the passage of a historic infrastructure bill, the groundwork has been laid for longer-term economic investments.

The work has just begun. Challenges remain: weathering the next phase of the pandemic, curbing inflation, and investing in long-neglected parts of our economy. But, the Administration is poised for the next chapter with its continued focus on protecting and investing in America.

America in January 2021

When President Biden took office, America faced a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety—about the pandemic’s path and the viability of the nascent economic recovery. On the day he was sworn in, COVID-19 had endangered people’s lives and impeded many families’ means of safely supporting themselves and their children for almost a year.

It was still unclear how well vaccines—new and out of reach for most Americans—would succeed in fighting the pandemic. By Inauguration Day, only 1 percent of the population was fully vaccinated. No one knew for sure whether vaccines would hold up, particularly as the virus mutated and unknown variants emerged.

The pandemic uncertainty also increased economic uncertainty. In just the one month before President Biden took office, the United States had lost 306,000 jobs, and there were still about 4 million workers who had been unemployed for more than six months. While private sector forecasters predicted the unemployment rate would decline over 2021, they believed the pace would be slow and end up at 5 to 6 percent at year’s end.

In addition, the United States still faced the issues that had contributed to decades of low and unequal economic growth. Inadequate Federal investment in research and infrastructure, decreasing competition, and a notable lack of support for America’s workers had resulted in an economy that worked for some but left many behind, especially people and communities of color. Therefore, while the economy needed immediate attention to fight the pandemic, it also needed reform to create stronger and more equitable economic growth moving forward.

Supporting the economy through the pandemic

The pandemic has posed one of the greatest economic challenges this country has ever faced. In addition to the pandemic being a fast and severe blow to economic activity, the ever-changing nature of the virus required economic policy to be nimble enough to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing outlook.

President Biden met the challenge. In his first year of office the Administration focused on rescuing a damaged economy—and the people it left in its wake—as the pandemic continued. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) was an insurance policy for the economy, businesses, workers, and families harmed by the economic uncertainty brought about by the virus. The ARP prioritized ensuring that there were enough resources to get and keep the recovery on track. Examples include support for households in the form of Economic Impact Payments (stimulus checks), expanded unemployment insurance, and the expanded Child Tax Credit; increased funds to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to help support small businesses; and flexible funds to State and local governments and school districts to fight COVID, keep schools open, and prevent cuts to services by State and local governments (a casualty during the Great Recession).

The ARP was crafted to address the extraordinary uncertainty of a global pandemic, supporting the economy and public health response as the virus evolved, often in unpredictable ways. The emergency measure worked, and the resulting pick-up in economic growth in 2021 has been extraordinary. The unemployment rate has come down much faster than forecasters predicted and GDP growth has been stronger than they anticipated at the start of the year. Labor force participation also rose substantially: prior to the pandemic, the economy had not seen a twelve-month increase in prime-age (25 to 54) labor force participation exceeding 0.9 percentage point since the mid-1980s.

Moreover, the long-term unemployment rate has been cut in half since December 2020. In comparison, during the Great Recession it took around four years for the long-term unemployment rate to fall that quickly. Long-term unemployment is typically one of the most difficult and pernicious economic challenges coming out of downturn, as those who have been unemployed for more than 6 months often struggle to find work. Given that, the rapid improvement in long term unemployment in 2021 is astonishing.

It is also remarkable that in a year of loss and unprecedented hardships, the poverty rate (as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) is expected to have reached a record-low level of 8.5 percent in 2021.[1] For the first time ever, the poverty rate of children is projected to be lower than that of the general population, also approaching a historically low level of 5.9 percent. Furthermore, these reductions are projected to be widely shared, with hundreds of thousands of adults and children of all races lifted over the poverty line last year.

These short-run rescue measures do not just affect economic growth in 2021; in fact, they are an important way the Biden Administration has supported long-run economic growth. By making up for family income lost due to the pandemic, supporting the unemployed, and reducing child poverty, the rescue agenda prevented much of the long-term scarring—what economists call “hysteresis”—that can be a persistent drag on long-run growth after deep recessions.

In fact, the International Monetary Fund now believes the U.S. economy will be larger in 2024, with higher employment, than it predicted prior to the pandemic. Without action from policymakers, long-term growth potential may well have been held back due to scarring or insufficient investment. By providing extraordinary support for Americans in the dark days of the pandemic, the Biden Administration helped lay a strong foundation on which to build a better economy for the future.

Rebuilding for sustained and shared growth

Helping families and businesses weather the pandemic and prevent long-term scarring from its economic harms is not enough, however, to ensure a strong and equitable economy going forward. A dearth of needed Federal investment has held back growth and well-being in the United States for decades. Thus, returning the United States to a path of sustainable, inclusive growth is a critical part of the Biden Administration’s legislative agenda. A historic step toward this goal was this year’s enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (now known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or BIL), which provides long overdue investment in our nation’s physical infrastructure.

The BIL is focused on rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure and fighting climate change, which includes investing in roads and bridges, clean water, and access to broadband. It makes investments in upgrading U.S. ports and waterways, closing technological gaps between U.S. and foreign port infrastructure. It further invests $66 billion in railways, which handle about 28 percent of domestic freight transportation and have also been under significant strain. By strengthening America’s goods transportation system, these public investments will encourage private businesses to invest and hire workers, particularly in manufacturing. Unlike the ARP, which was short-run stimulus and insurance designed to be spent out over the course of the pandemic emergency, the BIL will be spent out over years, building and strengthening the foundation our economy needs to increase its productive capacity.

President Biden has also taken Executive action to strengthen the U.S. economy. For instance, in July, the Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at increasing competition in markets in the United States. Concentration has increased in over 75 percent of U.S. industries since the late 1990s (as discussed at-length in a previous CEA piece), and the profits and markups of the largest firms—indicators that many economists point to as aggregate measures of market power across the economy—have grown over the last 30 to 40 years. For instance, in 1977, the largest four beef-packing firms controlled 25 percent of the market, compared to 82 percent today. Over 80 million (or about 25 percent of) Americans have access to only one broadband provider.

When there is insufficient competition, dominant firms can use their market power to charge higher prices, offer decreased quality, and block potential competitors from entering the market—meaning entrepreneurs and small businesses cannot participate on a level playing field, and new ideas cannot become new goods and services. Market power is connected to inequality; in an economy without adequate competition, prices and corporate profits are elevated, while workers’ wages are depressed. This means large corporations and their shareholders have increased wealth compared to a more competitive equilibrium, while consumers and workers pay the cost. Thus, this Executive Order is aimed at bringing the weight of the Federal government to bear on an issue that has remained largely unaddressed for decades.

As another example, the Administration issued a first of its kind Executive Order on racial equity aimed at advancing equity throughout the Federal government and finding ways through agency action to achieve that goal. Improving equity in our economy can increase our productive capacity by ensuring that everyone is achieving their full potential. As one example, Mary Daly and co-authors estimate that the cost to the economy of racial and ethnic economic inequality was over $20 trillion in the past 30 years. Similarly, the Administration undertook historic strides in ensuring the full participation of women in all aspects of society, including in the economy. These include the establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council and the creation of the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. Supporting women, who make up more than half of the U.S. population, advances the nation’s full economic potential.

There were many other administrative actions taken this past year to improve the foundation for long-run economic growth. For instance, President Biden called for an all-of-government approach to address climate change, which presents a huge threat to the future of stable and strong economic growth (discussed in a previous CEA issue brief). By the end of this century, the increase in global average temperatures could surpass 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), which one recent meta-analysis finds could cause damages equal to 7 to 11 percent of annual global GDP year-after-year and create systemic risks to environmental, human, and economic systems. The Administration brought the automobile industry and the United Auto Workers together to commit that by 2030, half of all light vehicles sold would be electric, and the Environmental Protection Agency finalized Federal greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks for Model Years 2023 through 2026. These standards leverage advances in clean car technology to unlock up to $190 billion in net benefits to Americans—including reducing climate pollution, improving public health, and saving drivers money at the pump.

The Administration also issued an Executive Order increasing the minimum wage to $15 for workers on Federal contracts. Raising the minimum wage helps workers at the bottom of the income distribution by increasing earnings growth. Importantly, the economic literature suggests it may also increase worker productivity and reduce turnover, both benefits to employers.

These are but a few examples of important accomplishments in the first year of the Biden Administration that should lay the foundation for stronger, more inclusive economic growth going forward.

Challenges ahead

Despite the substantial policy successes of 2021 and the extensive economic recovery, we cannot come out of two years of one of history’s most extraordinary crises without facing additional challenges. One of the most serious is inflation. Price growth in the Consumer Price Index as of December 2021 was 7 percent year-over-year. The pandemic itself has been a major driver of inflation. The pandemic necessitated critical support for the economy which fostered strong consumer demand. Further exacerbated by a shift from services to goods, this put unprecedented pressure on global supply chains, which were already strained by the impact of the pandemic. While private-sector forecasters foresee price growth moderating in 2022 and beyond, high inflation is a burden for American families today. There is also ongoing uncertainty about energy and food prices, which are volatile and affected by a number of global factors, including weather and geopolitical events.

The principal means to reduce inflation, of course, rests with the Federal Reserve in the context of their dual mandate. Notwithstanding the Fed’s leadership and importance, however, there are also important steps that the President and Congress can take to help families deal with costs, especially through measures that aim to expand the productive capacity of the economy over the short-, medium-, and long-term.

The most serious short-run threat to our productive capacity is the pandemic itself, and so policies to address the virus ought to be seen not only as public health actions, but also as economic capacity measures. The labor force, supply chains, and businesses are still being impacted by the challenges that come with high virus caseloads. For instance, if it was no longer the case that any worker was out of the workforce or unable to work due to COVID, the gap between the prime-age employment rate and its pre-pandemic level would close by about 25 percent. That fact speaks to the importance of the pandemic in the labor force disruptions that families and businesses are currently experiencing.

In addition, there are still investments in the long-run growth potential of the economy that must be made, addressing problems and shortfalls that pre-date the pandemic. For decades, our economy has lacked policies that invest in our people, including those that facilitate labor supply and provide investments in children. History teaches us this is not the right path. Investments made in the early 20th century in universal primary and secondary schooling drove growth throughout that century. The United States developed a highly skilled labor force, and established some of the best universities in the world.

Yet, the United States has now fallen behind. As one measure, the United States ranked 35th in math and 11th in reading in the 2018 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment. Research and employment projections indicate that demand for the kinds of postsecondary skills provided by higher education has increased and will likely continue to do so. One paper documents that the share of employment in professional, technical, and managerial occupations—high-paying occupations typically associated with at least some college education—grew from around 30 percent in 1970 to 46 percent in 2016. Estimates are that nearly half of net job creation between 2020 and 2030 will be in occupations that require at least some postsecondary schooling at the entry level, and two out of five will require at least an AA degree.[2] Investments in Pell grants, community colleges, HBCUs, and other education and training can help workers move into higher-paying jobs.

Similarly, there is evidence that the United States has fallen behind our economic competitors because of a failure to implement policies that allow families to address tensions between work and family life. Labor force participation in the United States for people ages 25 to 54 peaked at more than 84 percent in 1999, but has since slumped through three recessions and never again reached that level. Research shows that workplace supports, such as access to affordable, high-quality childcare and paid leave, are associated with higher labor force participation and job retention among caregivers, particularly mothers.

Some of these investments would both increase economic capacity moving forward and help with some of the labor supply issues the economy is currently facing. For instance, paid leave and childcare are not only important for long-term economic growth, but would also help ameliorate some of the pandemic disruptions that have held back labor force growth. Similarly, immigration would help improve economic growth and also provide needed support during the pandemic.

It is important that we stop neglecting these important investments, as the President’s agenda attempts to do, in order to ensure strong, sustained economic growth moving forward.

Conclusion

Given the uncertainty around the pandemic and the economy at the beginning of the year, economic progress was not pre-ordained. But thanks in large part to the rescue and investment actions taken by the Administration, the last year has seen unprecedented improvement in our economy and important investments made in its future productive capacity. Effective economic policy has supported families, workers, and businesses, and in doing so, likely averted long-term scarring that would have undermined economic growth in years to come. The Administration has made additional investments in sustainable economic growth through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and executive actions such as those aimed at promoting competition and addressing racial inequity. Challenges remain, but substantial down payments have been made on investments in long-term growth, laying the foundation for stronger and more widely shared prosperity for decades to come.

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand the public’s views on President Joe Biden, other congressional leaders and the nation’s economy. For this analysis, we surveyed 6,174 U.S. adults between June 27 and July 4, 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology.

With public views of the nation’s economy at their most negative in years, Joe Biden’s political standing is at the lowest point of his presidency. Yet Biden is hardly the only focal point of the country’s political discontent: Americans express unfavorable views of both major parties and a range of leading political figures, including Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump.

Biden’s current job approval numbers are the lowest since he became president, with 37% of U.S. adults saying they approve of how he is handling his job as president while 62% disapprove. Biden’s job rating has declined 6 percentage points since March (43%) and 18 points over the past year; last July, a 55% majority approved of Biden’s job performance.

Amid persistent inflation, the public’s views of the national economy have worsened since the start of this year. Today, just 13% of adults say economic conditions in the United States are excellent or good; 28% said this six months ago.

A majority of Americans say Biden’s policies have hurt the economy: 56% now say his policies have made economic conditions worse, compared with just 11% who say his policies have improved the economy. About a third (32%) say they have not had much of an effect. The share of Americans who say Biden’s policies have made economic conditions worse has increased 16 percentage points since last September.

Views of the economy – and the impact of the president’s policies on economic conditions – have long been deeply divided along partisan lines. Still, only 20% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say Biden’s policies have made the economy better, while 52% say they have had little impact and 27% say they have made things worse. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 90% say Biden’s policies have made the economy worse.

A new Pew Research Center survey of 6,174 U.S. adults, conducted June 27 to July 4, finds that just 20% of Democrats and 5% of Republicans rate the nation’s economic conditions as excellent or good. These opinions have declined substantially since January, when 36% of Democrats and 20% of Republicans viewed the economy positively. Currently, Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to rate conditions as poor (67% vs. 32%); Democrats are more likely to say they are “only fair” (47% vs. 28%).

The public’s economic concerns are dominated by worries over rising prices. Three-quarters of Americans say they are very concerned about rising prices for food and consumer goods; an identical share say they are very concerned about rising prices for gasoline and energy. Majorities in almost every demographic group say they are very worried about rising prices for food and energy.

Among five other issues asked about, the cost of housing is the next most concerning for the public, with six-in-ten saying they are very concerned about this. About four-in-ten (42%) are very concerned about limited availability for some consumer products. Fewer Americans say they are very concerned about employers finding workers to hire (32%), the performance of the stock market (31%) or people being unable to find jobs (27%).

When asked to assess possible causes for inflation, nearly half of adults (49%) say “businesses taking advantage of economic conditions to increase their profits” has contributed a lot to rising prices. Nearly as many (45%) cite the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing and shipping.

Fewer say that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (39%), government aid to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic (32%), or the fact that interest rates were very low until recently (25%) have contributed a lot to rising prices.

Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and businesses taking advantage of conditions to increase profits are major factors driving inflation. Republicans, by contrast, are more likely to point to the government’s aid to deal with economic impact of the pandemic.

Other important findings from the survey

Both parties continue to be viewed unfavorably. With less than four months until the midterm elections, neither party is very popular with the public. Slightly more Americans say they view the Democratic Party (41%) favorably than say so about the Republican Party (37%), but clear majorities view both parties unfavorably (61% for the GOP and 57% for the Democrats).

Biden, Trump, congressional leaders viewed more negatively than positively. The public’s views of eight political leaders included on the survey – including Biden and Trump – are all unfavorable overall. The public gives Biden (43% favorable vs. 55% unfavorable) slightly better ratings than Trump (38% vs. 60%). Congressional leaders fare the worst, with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi each viewed unfavorably by about six-in-ten Americans (62% McConnell and 60% Pelosi). Views of Vice President Kamala Harris and former Vice President Mike Pence are somewhat more positive, yet both are still underwater in their personal favorability ratings.

Biden is viewed negatively – but better than Trump – on some dimensions. Evaluations of Biden’s performance in specific areas are largely negative – as they were for Trump at a similar point in his presidency – but Biden outperforms Trump on setting “a high moral standard for the presidency” (43% say Biden has definitely or probably done this, compared with 27% who said it about Trump in August 2018) and running “an open and transparent administration” (44% say this about Biden today vs. 37% about Trump four years ago). However, more said Trump improved the way government worked (37% in 2018) than say this about Biden today (29%).

More agree with the GOP than with Democrats on economic policy, but Democrats have edge on most issues. Americans are more likely to say they agree with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on a number of key issues – including policies on health care, race, COVID-19 and climate change as well as policies affecting LGBT people.

However, the Republican Party holds a 7 percentage point advantage on the economy: 40% Americans say they agree with the GOP on economic policy, compared with a third who say they agree with the Democratic Party.

With abortion policy in the spotlight following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, 43% say they agree with the Democrats on abortion policy, while 29% say that about Republicans; another 26% say they agree with neither party on abortion policy."
203,Biden hit on economy as more say finances poor: AP-NORC poll - The Associated Press,Biden hit on economy as more say finances poor: AP-NORC poll  The Associated Press,"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2luZmxhdGlvbi1iaWRlbi1oZWFsdGgtZWNvbm9teS1vbmx5LW9uLWFwLTY1NTQwY2ZhMGY0OTNjYTk0YWZkMWZlZmQ2OWRmMzNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — More U.S. adults are now feeling financially vulnerable amid high inflation — a political risk for President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats one month before the midterm elections.

Some 46% of people now call their personal financial situation poor, up from 37% in March, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That’s a notable downturn at a particularly inopportune moment for Biden, given that the share of Americans who felt positive about their finances had stayed rock steady over the last few years — even during the economic turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic.

And while a majority of Americans see high prices as beyond Biden’s control, they continue to disapprove of his handling of the economy overall.

Overall, 54% say their finances are good in the latest survey. That figure was at least 62% through the global recession caused by the pandemic in 2020, and even in late 2021 and early 2022 as prices began to rise across the country. But inflation’s prolonged bite has left the U.S. and wider world facing the possibility of a downturn and, despite solid job growth, more consumers are feeling the pain.

In Salado, Texas, Bethany Saunders saw the rate she paid for electricity double in August, and her water bill jumped as well as she dealt with a summer heat and drought. Her utilities bills totaled $800, a shock to the 43-year-old, who had carefully budgeted after going without a pay raise for two years.

“That just drained my bank account — I’m not rich, but I knew what I could live on,” said Saunders, who voted Republican in 2020 and plans to do so again this year.

Overall, views of Biden and of the direction of the country held steady in October, after improving somewhat in September. Forty-three percent say they approve of how Biden is handling his job as president, while 25% say the country is headed in the right direction. Biden’s approval rating had dropped as low as 36% in a July AP-NORC poll, and the percentage saying the country is headed in the right direction dropped as low as 14% in June.

The president has been steadfast in saying he believes the economy can escape a recession, and he said in an interview broadcast Tuesday by CNN that any potential downturn would be modest.

“I don’t think there will be a recession,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “If it is, it’ll be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly.”

Saunders doesn’t think Biden is entirely to blame for her higher bills, but she said h is $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year with its direct payments to Americans was excessive. Some leading economists say the money helped ignite inflation that reached a 40-year peak in June. The government will release an inflation report on Thursday, and economists expect it to show that prices rose 8.1% in September from a year ago.

“I see him throwing money at things we don’t need,” Saunders said of Biden. “It makes me think of the Oprah episode that became famous. ‘You get a car, you get a car, you get a car.’”

The drop in financial well-being was especially acute among Americans in households making less than $50,000 a year, just 33% of whom now call their personal finances good compared with 50% in March. Sixty-one percent of those in household making between $50,000 and $100,000 call their personal finances good, as do 75% of those making more than that — both down only slightly since earlier in the year.

In the latest poll, 23% call the national economy good. That’s similar to the percentage in June but down slightly from 29% in September, when views of the national economy had shown signs of improvement. The drop since September came primarily among Democrats, from 46% then to 35% now. In September, Democrats had appeared increasingly optimistic about the economy compared with earlier in the summer.

Sandra Baker, 56, said she voted for Biden and intends to support Democrats in this year’s elections. The Lincoln, Nebraska resident said the president is trying his best to fix the economy and address political divides.

“He’s doing all he can do, but everything else is so screwed up it doesn’t really matter,” Baker said. “The general vibe — everything the Democrats do — seems to be toward helping the little man and it’s always been like that.”

But the economy has proved a challenge — with gasoline costs becoming a renewed source of financial pressure. The average price at the pump was $3.92 a gallon on Wednesday, up roughly 5.5% from a month ago, according to AAA. Support for Biden had picked up after a 99-day drop in gas prices from a June high that ended in September.

Views of Biden’s handling of the economy remain underwater. Only 36% say they approve and 63% disapprove. But Americans aren’t heaping all the blame for inflation at Biden’s feet: 55% say higher than usual prices are mostly because of factors outside Biden’s control, while 44% say that’s happening mostly because of Biden’s policies.

The president has blamed rising energy and food prices on Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine. He’s also blasted oil companies and refineries for raking in profits off the higher prices, instead of doing more to increase production. Saudi Arabia and other countries tied to OPEC dealt the U.S. a further blow last week by announcing plans to cut oil production by 2 million barrels a day in response to the slowing economy, a move that the administration said would support oil exporters such as Russia.

There are bright spots in the poll for Biden — 55% say they approve of how he’s handling the coronavirus pandemic, long one of his strongest issues, and 63% approve of his handling of natural disaster relief following Hurricane Ian, which battered Florida two weeks ago. On the other hand, just 39% approve of how Biden is handling immigration.

Inflation is at a 40-year record high. Yet, President Joe Biden and his administration say that the economy is better than ever. This week, Distinguished Visiting Fellow Stephen Moore explains the truth about Joe Biden’s economy.

Michelle Cordero: From The Heritage Foundation, I'm Michelle Cordero and this is Heritage Explains.

Cordero: Inflation rates hit a 40 year high last week, coming in at 9.1%. The cost of everyday staples also increased. The price of eggs went up 33.1%, meat 8.2%, gasoline 59.9%, used cars 7.1% and air travel 34.1%. This is all in addition to supply shortages. Yet as the economy is flashing huge red warning signs, President Joe Biden and his administration are telling us something different.

Joe Biden: Look, here's where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world, the world, the world. We have 8.6 million new jobs just since I got in an office. Unemployment rates down to 3.6%. We've reduced the deficit last year by $320 billion, this year going to reduce it by $1.7 trillion dollars, trillion dollars.

Clip: When you look at inflation, when we look at where we are economically, and we are in a strong, we are stronger economically than we have been in history. When you look at the unemployment numbers at 3.6%, when you look at the jobs numbers, more than 8.7 million of new jobs created, that is important. But we understand that gas prices are high and we understand that food costs are high. And that is because of a once in a generation pandemic and also Putin's war. And that's just the facts.

Cordero: So what's the truth? Are we growing faster and stronger than ever, or is our economy in a downward spiral? Today Stephen Moore, a distinguished fellow in economics at Heritage, will explain. Our conversation after this short break.

Cordero: Steve Moore, thank you so much for joining us.

Stephen Moore: Hi, Michelle. Great to be with you.

Cordero: Okay. So we know what we're seeing at the pump and at the grocery store, we're feeling the pain. So why is the Biden administration saying the economy has never been better? What are they looking at?

Moore: Well, I think first of all, this really suggests that the people in the White House are just out of touch with what's going on in real America. We've always talked about Washington being a bubble, where politicians of both side of the aisle are just not in touch with what's happening in main street America. And this is a really a picture perfect example of that, where it's laughable and it's actually insulting for the Biden administration to tell people who are seeing their incomes being ravaged by the highest inflation rate in 40 years.

Moore: You see there was a study that came out recently that a lot of families are really having to cut back and even the essentials that they buy because their incomes are falling relative to the price of everything from gasoline to buying milk and all the other things that people have to buy, rent.

Moore: And so it's not a good economy. 82% of Americans, according to New York Times poll, and they're hardly on the right, Americans say the country's headed in the wrong direction. And it is. It is headed in the wrong direction. We've got the high gas prices. We have a situation now where I believe we're in a, what I call a soft recession, where the last two quarters have been negative, now only a little bit negative, but still that's officially in a recession.

Moore: And the real question now, I think going forward, Michelle, is whether we're going to have a crash landing here. Whether we're going to be able to glide out of this and we can talk about that, but I'm worried.

Cordero: So another thing we've heard from Joe Biden is that Americans have record savings. Where's he getting that? Is that true?

Moore: Yeah. I'm working on a paper right now, that's why I was laughing. About the things, the multiple things that Biden has said about the economy that are not true. And that's one of the ones I don't even understand.

Moore: Sometimes you can cherry pick data and say, oh, look, this shows, but we've just lived through a stock market crash where the economy's lost $8 trillion in savings. So it's really delusional to say Americans have record high savings when every day that goes by, people are losing their lifetime savings. I mean, my God, my wife and I just looked at our 401k plan and I'm not rich, we lost a couple hundred thousand dollars just in the last six months of our lifetime savings because of the crash in the market.

Moore: And then the fact is that I was looking at credit card data, Americans aren't saving, they're dis-saving, they're running up their credit card so they can pay their bills. So that is another one that it just doesn't comport with reality.

Cordero: So let's talk about the job market. I'm just going to kind of run through some of these indicators. The left claims that the job market is growing. Is that true?

Moore: Look, the job market is good right now. It is good. And there are jobs out there. So my advice to people, if you're been sitting on the sideline for two years, like a lot of people have throughout COVID, now would be a good time to get a job while they're still available. Job growth is definitely slowing. And so over the last three months, we've seen there's fewer Americans working today than there were three months ago.

Moore: And I think we're all a little puzzled. Even the economics team here at Heritage, we have a lot of discussions about why is this happening? Why aren't Americans filling the jobs that are out there? And I do think the government benefits is a big part of this, that we're paying people not to work.

Moore: And one of the things, I mean, the people regulars here at Heritage know that Heritage played such a big role in the 1990s on the historic welfare reforms, where we required people to work to get benefits. We all believe in a safety net, but you have to either be working or looking for a job or getting training.

Moore: And people should realize that under Obama, then especially so under Biden, we've eviscerated all of those. Almost all of the work requirements are gone. And so you've got people who can get rental assistance, food stamps, free healthcare, $300 a week per child benefits, unemployment benefits, all of these things. And they add up to, and by the way, this is all tax free, without working an hour, you can make 70, $75,000 a year. So we have to get back to the idea of work fair.

Cordero: So you're saying, going back to the question that the job market is growing, but that's due to the circumstances left over from the pandemic.

Moore: Yeah, exactly. We're still a little bit below where we were in 2019. We haven't still fully recovered.

Moore: And the other part of this, Michelle, that's really interesting that we've been doing a lot of work on here at Heritage, is looking at the difference between what's happening in the red states and the blue states. So Republican governors handled COVID much, much better than the blue states did. They kept their schools open. They allowed their businesses where possible to stay open, whereas the blue states just shut down.

Moore: And so even to this day, the red states have lower unemployment rates. They have healthier businesses. And so it is also a kind of a tale of two countries. The job market is pretty good in the red states and in the blue states, you still have a lot higher unemployment.

Cordero: Okay. Another indicator is the housing market. Fox Business recently reported that home sale cancellations hit its highest rate since the start of the pandemic. What does that tell us?

Moore: I'm worried about housing because I think we all remember what happened in 2007 and 2008 when we had the financial collapse that was led by the bursting of the housing bubble. And Lord, I don't want to see that again. I mean, that was just a total collapse of the US economy.

Moore: I am worried about a bubble in the housing market. You've got record low affordability, so people can't afford the prices of the houses, and then you have rising mortgage rates. So just to give you an example, now, mortgage rates actually have come down a little bit in the last few weeks, thank goodness. They hit 6%. Now they're at about 5.7, but they were at 3%. So let's just use the single example from three to 6% on a mortgage rate, you have a 30 year mortgage and a $500,000 home, which is about the median house value today. You're going to pay an extra 150 to $200,000 in interest payments over the life of that mortgage. So it's making housing even more expensive and I do think you're going to see a slow down.

Moore: Now, look, we've had a, the housing market's been through the roof over the last five years, so it's got to come down. I just hope it doesn't crash.

Cordero: All right. And then one more thing that I'm seeing the left is actually admitting that inflation is going up, but I see them following it up with, but so are wages. Does that matter?

Moore: Sure. I mean, what's killing the economy and killing families right now is that for roughly the last year or 14 months or so, inflation is up about 8% and wages are up about 5%. So that means families in real terms are 3% poor than they were when Biden came into office. And I lived through this in 1970s. So, people would get eight or 9% pay raises and yet inflation was running at 12%, so they were actually losing money. And that's the phenomenon you're seeing right now.

Cordero: So the left is spinning that then by acting like wages are up is a good thing. Forget about the fact that inflation is up.

Moore: Yeah. Because we want to look at the purchasing power of your wages. And so that's way down. And so we've got to get the inflation rate down. I mean, I want to make this point crystal clear, until we get this inflation rate down, inflation like a cancer, it just kills an economy. You see that throughout American history, you see it in other countries. So we got to, job number one is get that inflation rate down to at least, right now we're at eight and a half percent, we got to get down to no more than four and then get it back down to about the 2% range you want it at.

Moore: And so the Fed has been way behind the curve on this. But another point we've been making at Heritage to all the members of Congress and the people in the policy making positions is the match that lit the forest fire of this high inflation was the runaway spending that happened. And it was the last year of Trump and the first year and a half of Biden where we spent three and a half trillion dollars we didn't have.

Moore: And my only surprise that any economists are even surprised that, of course that's going to lead to inflation when you just flood the zone with all of this cheap money, then all of a sudden it's, as Milton Friedman taught us, it's too many dollars in the economy chasing too few goods. So you've got to, Fed has to start pulling back that money.

Moore: And then the other thing we're talking a lot at Heritage about to, especially the Republicans because they will take Congress, is now you need also a pro growth agenda of how do we get an increase in the supply of goods and services? Well, you're not going to give that by raising taxes and raising regulations. And so we need a pro America energy policy to, as Trump had, we need to be cutting taxes and we need to get government spending under control.

Cordero: All right, Steve, this is your wheelhouse. You're a rockstar when it comes to these issues.

Cordero: In conclusion, we're feeling pain at the pump, feeling pain at the grocery store. The left is telling us that's not true, the economy's great. In a nutshell, what is the state of the economy right now? And are we heading into a recession or not?

Moore: I would use the word precarious. We're in a really dangerous spot right now. We have to turn things around. And Michelle, something that really worries me, that's keeping me up at night now, is as you and I speak, unfortunately, you've got Chuck Schumer now negotiating with Joe Manchin, who was my man of the year. But if he makes a deal with Manchin, I mean with Schumer, for another version of this Build Back Better, you're talking about potentially another trillion dollars of spending and taxes, that would be catastrophic. I mean, I can't imagine they would do something that damaging the economy. We need to be cutting spending and taxes and the Democrats want to do the exact opposite. So that will be our big focus as we've got to stop this bill from happening.

Moore: The Democrats have 50 votes in the Senate, so we have to, hopefully Kristin Sinema or maybe Joe Manchin will come to their senses because if they pass that bill, we'll have a severe recession. That's how dangerous that bill is.

Cordero: Steve, thank you so much for your time and your clarification on these issues.

Moore: Okay. Thank you, Michelle. Have a great week.

Cordero: And that's it for this week's episode. If you liked it, we would be so happy if you left us a five star rating and comment, wherever you get your podcasts.

The summer of 2022 is a season of deepening and widespread discontent, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The survey finds the public’s outlook on the state of the country the worst it’s been since 2009, while its view on the economy is the worst since 2011. And nearly 7 in 10 say President Joe Biden hasn’t paid enough attention to the nation’s most pressing problems.

Biden’s approval rating in the poll stands at 38%, with 62% disapproving. His approval ratings for handling the economy (30%) and inflation (25%) are notably lower. Rising costs are a primary economic pressure for most Americans: 75% call inflation and the cost of living the most important economic problem facing their family. Last summer, that figure stood at 43%.

With midterm elections approaching, the poll finds no indication that Biden’s standing with the public is improving – and among some critical constituencies, it is worsening. Among Democrats, for example, Biden’s approval numbers have softened by 13 points since the spring (from 86% in a late April through early May poll to 73% now), while his numbers among independents and Republicans have held about even. Biden’s approval rating among Democrats for handling the economy is also on the decline (62% approve, down from 71% this spring). And on inflation, it is barely above water (51% of Democrats approve, 47% disapprove).

Among people of color, 45% now approve of Biden’s overall performance, down from 54% in the spring. That decline includes a 6-point dip among Black adults and a 9-point decline among Hispanic adults. Biden’s approval ratings for handling the economy and inflation now break negative among Black adults, who have been among the President’s strongest backers (47% approve and 52% disapprove on the economy, while 34% approve and 65% disapprove on inflation).

Few Americans who approve of Biden’s overall performance say they do so strongly. Overall, just 12% strongly approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency compared with 43% who say they strongly disapprove of his work. Only 28% of Democrats strongly approve, while among Republicans, strong disapproval is nearly universal at 84%.

The public’s perceptions of the economy and of how things are going in the country overall are deeply negative and worsening. Since the spring, the share saying things are going badly for the country has climbed 11 points to 79%, the highest since February 2009, and shy of the all-time worst reached in November 2008 by just four points. That shift comes largely among Democrats. Just 38% of Democrats now say things are going well in the country, down from 61% this spring. Likewise, there’s been a steep drop among people of color, from 41% saying things were going well in the spring to 27% now.

Only 18% of Americans describe the nation’s economy as in good shape, while 82% say economic conditions are poor. About 4 in 10 (41%) describe the economy as “very poor,” up 11 points since the spring and nearly doubled since December. As some economists warn of a looming recession, most Americans think the country is already there. The poll finds 64% of Americans feel the economy is currently in a recession, higher than the shares who said so just ahead of the Great Recession (46% felt that way in October 2007) and a recession that began in 2001 (44% said the country was already in a recession in February ’01). Majorities across parties say the country is already in a recession, including 56% of Democrats, 63% of independents and 76% of Republicans.

Asked to name the biggest economic problem facing their family today, 75% call out an issue related to the cost of living or inflation, including 38% who mentioned inflation and rising costs generally, 29% who mention gas prices, and 18% who mention the cost of food. All of those figures have increased sharply since last summer. One poll participant said, “Prices on everything just keeps getting higher and higher. is it going to stop?” Another said, “I work 40+ hours and can barely afford to survive. With the price of gas and price of food so high, I don’t see how anyone can have extra money to do anything other than work.” And a third participant said, “Inflation causes so much pain with everything we buy and everything we do.”

While the public’s attention has shifted sharply to inflation, few think the President’s focus has followed. In the poll, 68% say Biden has not paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems, up from 58% who said so last November. That outpaces the previous high in CNN polling saying a President’s attention has been misplaced (59% saying Donald Trump hadn’t paid attention to the most important problems in late summer 2017).

On this question too, Biden is losing ground among his core support groups. Among Democrats, 57% say he has the right priorities, down nearly 20 points from 75% last fall. Among people of color, just 35% say he has the right priorities, and among those younger than 35, only 23% say the President has the right focus.

The poll finds Biden’s approval ratings for handling immigration (39%) and the situation in Ukraine (46%) outperforming those for economic issues, but majorities disapprove on both issues.

The survey also suggests both the President’s and vice president’s personal favorability has taken a hit. A year and a half ago, just before their inauguration, 59% held a favorable opinion of Biden and 51% had a favorable view of Kamala Harris. Now, those figures stand at 36% and 32% respectively. Meanwhile, the public’s view of first lady Jill Biden is mixed: 34% have a favorable opinion, 29% unfavorable and 37% are unsure how they feel about her.

The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS June 13 through July 13 among a random national sample of 1,459 adults initially reached by mail, and is the third survey CNN has conducted using this methodology. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points."

And it’s especially true in political debate, where calling out spin, once the job of the media and the opposition, has been delegated to a handful of self-appointed critics, many without the impartial fortitude that digging deep into data requires.

Nowhere does that play out more evidently than in the economic policy arena, where political leaders and their supporters use and abuse statistics to make their case to voters without the due diligence many of their claims deserve. But despite the wealth of economic data that is easily accessed online to prove or disprove a particular assertion, spin has simply gotten the better of fact-based examination.

Both sides are guilty of employing selective statistics to win an argument, but, over the past year, the Biden White House and congressional Democrats have turned the phrase “cherry-picking data” into an art form.

So, with less than six weeks until the congressional midterms and the economy topping the list of voter concerns, here are some critical numbers (based on publicly available federal data) that people won’t get from the White House.

Inflation

President Joe Biden would have you believe that inflation, one of the country’s two top issues, is “zero,” as he likes to put it, or just “an inch.”

A deep dive into the consumer price index numbers shows that the Democrats’ happy talk on inflation is just that. Here’s a quick comparison of year-over-year inflation data for key consumer categories in January 2021 — the numbers Biden inherited — and the same data for August 2022.

Overall CPI: January 2021, 1.4 percent; August 2022, 8.3 percent

Gasoline CPI: January 2021, -8.6 percent; August 2022, 25.6 percent

Home Food CPI: January 2021, 3.7 percent; August 2022, 13.5 percent

Electricity CPI: January 2021, 1.5 percent; August 2022, 15.8 percent

Medical Care CPI: January 2021, 1.9 percent; August 2022, 5.4 percent

Apparel CPI: January 2021, -2.5 percent; August 2022, 5.1 percent

Economic growth

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, if nothing else, has been consistent in her attempts to sell the idea that last year’s economic growth was “historic” and the American economy is strong and heading in the right direction. One can only speculate as to what she is talking about.

Here’s how she put it Friday when asked about the pace of economic growth: “So, I talked about this a little bit already, how we’re coming off of last year’s historic economic growth. A lot of that is because of the work of this president and Democrats in Congress passing the American Rescue Plan, which puts us in a position where we saw the most stable growth, strongest growth that we have seen in modern history.”

Just to set the record straight. Ronald Reagan delivered four higher quarters of economic growth than Biden. Here are the numbers:

Reagan (1983) — second quarter, 9.4 percent; third quarter, 8.2 percent; fourth quarter, 8.6 percent

Reagan (1984) — first quarter, 8.1 percent

Biden (2021) — first quarter, 6.3 percent; second quarter, 6.7 percent; third quarter, 2.3 percent; fourth quarter, 6.9 percent

Biden (2022) — first quarter, -1.6 percent; second quarter, -0.6 percent

The first two quarters of this year, the gross domestic product has been under water, putting the country technically in a recession, a far cry from Jean-Pierre’s stable and strong economy.

Unemployment

Last week, Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, said at The Atlantic Festival, “It’s easy to forget that when Joe Biden came to office, we’d turn on the TV at night, people were in line in football stadiums, looking for a box of food. The unemployment rate was nearly 10 percent.”

Actually, it was the Trump administration that faced the highest unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, 14.7 percent in April 2020, as the country reeled from lockdowns. By the time Biden came into office, there was a vaccine already in distribution, the economy was recovering and unemployment had been cut by more than 8 points to 6.4 percent in the last nine months of the Trump presidency, a testament to the strength of the economy pre-COVID.

Also worth noting, during those same nine months, the Trump administration created 12.5 million jobs. Biden has created 9.7 million jobs in 19 months.

In fact, it took the Biden administration 18 months to get the unemployment rate down to its recent low of 3.5 percent in July. August saw it tick up to 3.7 percent. Truth be told, since Biden took office, the country managed only last month to finally recoup the jobs lost during the pandemic.

Stock market

On Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2021, the Dow was at 31,188 and the Nasdaq at 13,457. On Monday, the Dow had sunk to 29,261 with the Nasdaq sliding to 10,803.

Yet, only a week ago, when Biden was asked about the plunging stock market after the latest inflation numbers were released, he seemed to have a classic Alfred E. Neuman moment as the “What, me worry?” president told reporters, “The stock market doesn’t necessarily reflect the state of the economy, as you well know. And the economy is still strong. … I think we’re going to be fine.”

Tell that to the approximately 145 million Americans invested in the stock market who’ve seen losses in the neighborhood of $9 trillion since January. Or public pensions, which The Wall Street Journal reported “returning a median minus 7.9% for the fiscal year ended June 30, their worst losses since 2009, according to data from Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service.” Or to retirees, people with IRAs ready to retire, corporate 401(k) holders and others trying to save for the future.

Federal revenues

When Biden took office in January 2021, federal revenues for 2020 had been $3.421 trillion. This year, CBO projects that revenues will come in at $4.836 trillion, a 41.4 percent increase over 2020, the result of the tax structure that has been in place since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed in December 2017. One might think a 40-plus percent increase would be enough to cover Biden’s outsize spending agenda, but, instead, he and his supporters on the Hill have decided to raise taxes.

If Biden’s job approval is any indicator, people clearly understand that the economy is in trouble thanks to Biden’s disastrous economic agenda that began with the American Rescue Plan.

A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 43% of U.S. adults say they approve of the way Biden is handling his job as president, while 55% disapprove. That’s similar to October, just weeks before the Nov. 8 elections that most Americans considered pivotal for the country’s future.

Only about a quarter say the nation is headed in the right direction or the economy is in good condition. Both measures have been largely negative over the course of the year as inflation tightened its grip, but were more positive through much of Biden’s first year in office.

Mishana Conlee said she tries to be optimistic about the coming year, but she thinks things are going to the gutter because “our president is incompetent” and not mentally fit for the White House. The 44-year-old in South Bend, Indiana, said she’s frustrated about rising expenses when she’s living paycheck to paycheck as a dietary aide at a nursing home.

“The more I work, I just can’t get ahead,” Conlee said. “That’s just all there is to it.”

She doesn’t blame Biden for the state of inflation, but “I feel like he’s not doing anything to change it,” said Conlee, an independent who voted for former President Donald Trump. Biden’s “not doing us any good.”

The Biden administration in its second year in the White House relished economic growth, a series of legislative wins and relative success for the president’s party in the midterms. But that has yet to translate to glowing reviews from a pessimistic public.

“I don’t understand why his approval ratings are so low,” said 56-year-old Sarah Apwisch, highlighting the administration’s investments in infrastructure and computer chip technology.

Apwisch recognizes that it’s been “a tough year” and that prices are higher, but she’s hopeful because of the midterm results as a Republican-turned-Democrat who worries about the “Make America Great Again” movement’s influence on the GOP.

“We’re headed in the right direction,” said the Three Rivers, Michigan, resident who works for a market research company’s finance department. She is eager to see Democrats press forward on a wide-ranging agenda, including codifying abortion rights.

Even as Republicans took control of the House, Democrats defied historical precedent to stunt GOP gains and even improve their Senate majority, which was cemented with this week’s runoff win for Sen. Raphael Warnock, the lone Democrat in Georgia this year to be elected statewide.

Glen McDaniel of Atlanta, who twice voted for Warnock, thinks the Biden administration has moved the country forward and weathered the economic storm as well as possible.

“I think that this administration has done as much as they can” to fight inflation, the Democrat said.

But McDaniel, a 70-year-old medical research scientist, also thinks the nation faces “social headwinds” that he wants Biden and the party to prioritize.

“I think that the Democrats can be a little bit more aggressive” in legislating on things like marriage equality, reproductive rights and voting reform, he said.

The poll shows majorities of Democrats and Republicans alike think things in the country are on the wrong track, likely for different reasons.

But Democrats have shown renewed faith in Biden, boosting his overall job approval rating from a summer slump. Even so, the 43% who approve in the new survey remains somewhat depressed from 48% a year ago and much lower than 60% nearly two years ago, a month after he took office.

Seventy-seven percent of Democrats, but only 10% of Republicans, approve of Biden.

While many Americans don’t entirely blame Biden for high inflation, AP-NORC polling this year showed Biden consistently hit for his handling of the economy.

As in recent months, the new poll shows only a quarter of U.S. adults say economic conditions are good, while three-quarters call them bad. Nine in 10 Republicans, along with about 6 in 10 Democrats, say the economy is in bad shape. Ratings of the economy have soured amid record-high inflation, even as Biden touts falling gas prices and a low unemployment rate at 3.7%.

Joshua Steffens doubts that the job market is as good as indicators show. The 47-year-old in St. Augustine, Florida, said he has been unemployed and struggling to find an information technology job since September.

“Even though they’re trying to claim that things are looking good,” Steffens said, “in the trenches, it definitely does not appear that it’s so accurate.”

Biden’s shopping and vacationing, captured on broadcast news, is “tone deaf,” said the Republican, who called the president “a habitual liar.”

Steffens said he and his wife are experiencing rising expenses for electricity and groceries, and relying on his wife’s income has “put a strain” on their holiday shopping. He doesn’t think Biden is handling high inflation well.

“If he has policies that he’s trying to push through, then they’re not working currently,” Steffens said.

The poll of 1,124 adults was conducted Dec. 1-5 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

Biden said higher inflation was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding that “it’s not because of spending.” But there’s debate among economists over how much pandemic relief spending may have contributed.

The president used Sen. Rick Scott’s 11-point plan to claim that Republicans will raise taxes. But Scott now says he’s not advocating a tax increase on working Americans and retirees, and the plan may not have widespread support in the Republican Party.

Biden cherry-picked in saying “we produced more oil domestically in my first year in office than my predecessor did in his first year.” That’s accurate, but the amount of crude oil produced in Biden’s first year was less than the amount produced in 2019 and 2020.

He misleadingly took credit for historic deficit reduction, but most of that is the result of expiring emergency pandemic spending.

Biden boasted that “my Treasury Department” will “pay down the national debt this quarter.” He’s right, but the federal debt held by the public is up 10.2% under Biden so far, and Treasury has said it will resume borrowing next quarter.

The president said “not a penny” of the Republican tax cuts in 2017 “was paid for.” The tax law wasn’t fully paid for, but it raised some taxes in order to offset costs.

Biden spoke on May 10.

Inflation

Biden cited two reasons for high inflation: the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin. When asked about whether he bore any responsibility for inflation, Biden said, “I think our policies help, not hurt,” adding that “it’s not because of spending.”

But that’s a matter of debate. Some economists have said that the American Rescue Plan’s federal stimulus money, which, in turn, boosted consumer spending, has contributed to higher inflation. The White House cites other economists who have said the ARP had a small and temporary effect.

“There are two leading causes of inflation we’re seeing today,” Biden said. “The first cause of inflation is a once-in-a-century pandemic. Not only did it shut down our global economy, it threw the supply chain and demand completely out of whack, especially in countries where more effective recovery responses weren’t available, especially in those sectors that rely on semiconductors. … And this year we have a second cause — a second cause: Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine.” Biden said the latter had caused gas and food prices to rise.

Inflation is up 8.3% year-over-year as of April, a small drop from the 8.5% 12-month rise in March, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics said was the largest increase since December 1981.

The pandemic created supply-and-demand issues, as Biden said. “The identifiable factors behind goods inflation—a surge in consumer demand and lagging supply—are primarily pandemic-related,” Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, said in a November post on Brookings’ website.

As the Associated Press explained in a Jan. 12 article, widespread economic shutdowns early in the pandemic in 2020 led to job losses, a plunge in consumer demand and a drop in business investments. “But instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn, the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery, fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the Fed, which slashed interest rates, among other things. By spring this year, the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants, bars, shops and airports,” the AP said.

But businesses didn’t have enough supply or workers to meet that spiking demand. And in order to attract workers, wages increased, another reason consumers are facing higher prices for the goods businesses produce, NBC News explained in an April report on inflation.

Higher gas prices are also rooted in that pandemic-prompted supply-demand issue. As we’ve written before, oil supply dropped early in the pandemic, but it has now struggled to keep up with surging demand. Biden also has a point that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has affected gas prices. The Energy Information Administration said in its May 10 Short-Term Energy Outlook: “The possibility of oil supply disruptions resulting from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and associated sanctions on Russia continue to contribute to the Brent crude oil price remaining above $100/b. This uncertainty is occurring amid low inventory levels globally.”

The United Nations also has said 25 million tons of grain are stuck in Ukraine because of the conflict — another influence on higher food prices. Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard and a top economic adviser during the Obama administration, told the Harvard Gazette in March: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine is certain to drive inflation higher.”

Biden dismissed the idea that federal economic stimulus measures have contributed to inflation, responding to a reporter’s question after his speech: “The vast majority of the — of the — of the economists think that this is going to be a real tough problem to solve. But it’s not because of spending. We brought down the deficit.”

Some economists, however, have said the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief legislation, called the American Rescue Plan and enacted in March 2021, was too large and has pushed up inflation. Larry Summers, who was treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, wrote in a Feb. 4, 2021, op-ed in the Washington Post: “[T]here is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability.”

Other economists have since agreed that the relief, which included $1,400 checks to most Americans, has been a factor. That stimulus came after two other pandemic relief laws passed under then-President Donald Trump.

“In retrospect, it was more than what was needed,” Ellen Gaske, an economist at PGIM Fixed Income, told the Associated Press. “It was not just the size of the (relief) packages, but those direct cash payments to households added purchasing power very directly. And when you pushed that up against the supply disruptions because of COVID, the pressure valve was higher inflation.’’

Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, also told the New York Times that the amount of government spending in the first six months of 2021 made a difference. “If there had not been the bottlenecks and labor market shortages, it might not have mattered as much. But it did,” he said.

The Times, in its Jan. 22 story, also quoted Furman as saying the U.S. “has had much more inflation than almost any other advanced economy in the world,” and the difference was because “the United States’ stimulus is in a category of its own.”

On the other side of the debate is Moody’s Analytics. The White House pointed us to Moody’s February report that said the ARP only temporarily contributed to inflation and was necessary to stave off other economic ill effects. “The ARP has contributed to the acceleration in inflation by supporting increased consumer demand, but this occurred almost entirely in the first half of 2021 when higher inflation was not considered a problem,” the report said, adding that inflation was “even viewed positively” then “as many businesses were simply re-establishing the prices they had previously cut” during economic shutdowns.

Without the ARP, Moody’s model estimated unemployment would have been higher. “The ARP is responsible for adding well over 4 million more jobs in 2021, and the economy is currently on track to recovering all the jobs lost in the pandemic by the second quarter of this year. If there had been no ARP, it would have taken another year for the economy to recover all of these jobs.”

The unemployment rate is currently 3.6%, just a shade below the pre-pandemic low of 3.5% in February 2020.

Moody’s argued: “Inflation only became uncomfortably high when the Delta wave of the pandemic hit in late summer last year,” causing more supply and labor market issues.

The White House also pointed to an October report by economists with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco that estimated the ARP would bump up inflation but said the impact would be “minor,” causing “only a temporary increase in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation of about 0.3 percentage point per year through 2022.”

Biden cited a reduction in the deficit under his administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the $360 billion deficit for the first seven months of fiscal year 2022 is about $1.5 trillion lower than the deficit for the same period in 2021. But as we’ll explain below, that’s mostly because of expiring pandemic spending.

Republicans and Taxes

In his speech, Biden contrasted his economic vision with “the ultra-MAGA agenda” proposed by Sen. Rick Scott, who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Biden seized on Scott’s 11-point plan for how Senate Republicans would govern if they win the majority in 2022 to claim that Republicans will raise taxes.

Scott’s plan says: “All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount. Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax.” Biden said Scott’s tax proposal would raise taxes on 75 million families, and “[t]he average tax increase would be about $1,500 per family.”

The White House cited a report from the Tax Policy Center, which Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us “made assumptions about what a plan roughly like his [Scott’s] idea might look like.” The TPC modeled a plan that assumed every household would have to pay at least $100 in federal income tax ($200 for couples).

A spokesman for Scott said those assumptions about Scott’s plan are wrong, though the limitations Scott now applies to his proposal don’t match the words in his plan.

“To start, we did not analyze Scott’s idea because it was not really a plan,” Gleckman told us via email. “It was just one sentence that left out many important specifics. We don’t know how much minimum tax he’d have everyone pay, and we don’t know exactly who would be taxed and who would be exempt. Since he made the proposal, he has described many variations, though he has not yet changed his written proposal.”

But even using TPC’s assumptions, Biden didn’t get it exactly right. According to the TPC analysis, the average tax hike for all Americans would be $630. The average tax hike just for those who would be subject to the minimum tax (those who would otherwise pay less than $100 in income taxes) would be $1,480.

So how is it that people subject to a minimum $100 federal income tax would see their tax burden increase by so much more?

“It is because many low- and moderate-income households currently benefit from refundable tax credits such as the [child tax credit and the earned income tax credit],” Gleckman said. “They not only pay no income tax, they effectively get a payment from the IRS. So their income tax liability might be a negative number. Someone getting a refundable credit of, say, $1000 would owe $1100 more under Scott’s plan that they do today. They’d lose the $1000 credit plus they would owe $100. Another way to think about it: Scott would repeal all these refundable tax credits and then impose some minimum amount of tax on top of that.”

A spokesman for Scott said the assumptions made by the Tax Policy Center, and Biden, are wrong.

“Senator Scott has not called for a minimum tax, or any tax increases of any kind,” McKinley Lewis, communications director for Scott, told us via email.

Lewis pointed to an April 11 Daily Caller op-ed in which Scott said his plan does not propose raising income taxes on working-class Americans and retirees on Social Security. “If someone is working and paying into the system, whether through income tax, payroll tax, state and local taxes – this plan would have no effect on them,” Lewis said.

Scott in Daily Caller op-ed, April 11: Let’s be clear about what I am proposing, and what I’m not. Retirees have already paid plenty into the system. And working-class Americans are already paying into the system, whether through income tax, payroll tax, state and local taxes. You know them. They’re the people who set their alarm clocks and get up and get moving and provide for their families and make this country work! Whether they receive a tax refund or have to chip in a little more each April, they are taxpayers. My proposal wouldn’t change anything for them, but we should find ways to reduce their tax burden.

As we wrote in a previous story, nowhere in Scott’s plan does it say he was referring to only able-bodied, nonretirees who receive government benefits but don’t work and don’t pay federal income taxes or payroll taxes. Rather, the plan still says as of May 11 that “all Americans” should have to pay “income tax,” while saying that “over half of Americans” currently do not.

As we noted in our Feb. 24 story, the limitations Scott now puts on those subject to some income tax do not apply to “[o]ver half of Americans” — the language used in Scott’s plan. TPC estimated that 19.3% — or 34.4 million — of all tax units would owe neither federal income nor payroll taxes in 2021. And the ultimate percentage is even smaller than that, as the estimate includes more people, such as elderly and disabled Americans, whom Scott now says his proposal would not include.

We should also note, as we have previously, that while Biden refers to Scott’s plan as “their plan,” as if it is the Republican Party platform, there’s reason to believe it may not have widespread support in the party.

At a press conference on March 1, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in reference to Scott’s plan, “If we’re fortunate enough to have the majority next year, I’ll be the Majority Leader. I’ll decide in consultation with my members what to put on the floor. And let me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda. We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half of the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years. That will not be part of a Republican Senate majority agenda.”

Oil Production

Biden compared the amount of oil produced in his first year in office with the amount produced in the same time period under former President Donald Trump.

“Here at home, U.S. oil and gas production is approaching record levels. In fact, we produced more oil domestically in my first year in office than my predecessor did in his first year,” Biden said.

The U.S. produced about 4.1 billion barrels of crude oil in the first 12 months of Biden’s presidency (ending in January 2022). That was about 18.6% more than the 3.45 billion barrels of crude oil produced in Trump’s first 12 months (ending in January 2018).

Before Biden took office, however, annual crude oil production had increased nearly 28% in Trump’s four years as president.

When compared with production in more recent years, Biden’s first year total was almost 8.8% lower than the nearly 4.5 billion barrels produced in 2019, and about 0.9% less than the 4.13 billion barrels produced in 2020, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In its Short-Term Energy Outlook for May, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected that crude oil production will average 11.9 million barrels per day in 2022, which would be the highest average except for the 12.3 million barrels produced each day in 2019.

More Deficit Spin

Biden again misleadingly took credit for cutting federal deficits by historic amounts, even though most of the reduction in deficits has been the result of expiring emergency pandemic spending. And while the deficit fell between fiscal years 2020 and 2021, it would have fallen by a substantially larger amount if not for additional pandemic and infrastructure spending signed into law by Biden.

Biden: Under my plan, we’re on track to cut the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion. Let me say it again: $1.5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. The biggest one-year decline in all of history for America. And that’s in addition to last year we cut the budget $350 billion — the deficit, not the budget. The deficit: $350 billion.

As we wrote recently in our story “Biden’s Deficit Spin,” in February 2021, shortly after Biden took office and before any of Biden’s fiscal policies were enacted, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected a federal budget deficit of about $2.3 trillion in 2021, $874 billion less than the shortfall recorded in 2020. It projected deficits to fall again to $1.1 trillion in FY 2022 — meaning another $1.2 trillion reduction in the deficit from 2021. Combined, the deficits in FY 2021 and FY 2022 were expected to total $3.3 trillion. Those projections assumed no new changes in federal law.

But on March 11, 2021, Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law. The new emergency pandemic relief law included, among other things, increased child care tax credits, extended unemployment payments, small-business support and $1,400 checks to qualifying Americans. As a result, instead of the projected $874 billion drop in deficits between 2020 and 2021, the Congressional Budget Office said FY 2021 ended with a deficit of nearly $2.8 trillion—about $360 billion less than the deficit in 2020.

In an April 8 blog post titled “No, President Biden Has Not Implemented Historic Deficit Reduction,” the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote (with this emphasis) that “the main source of falling deficits is the expiration of most COVID relief such as enhanced unemployment benefits and recovery rebates. The remaining decrease is largely the result of strong income growth and high inflation.” CRFB also noted that even after this post-pandemic drop, deficits will remain historically high.

“The President’s actions to date have not reduced deficits but instead increased them,” CRFB wrote. “Between the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure law, and various executive orders, we estimate at least $2.5 trillion has been added to deficits through 2031 over the President’s term so far.”

Gleckman, at Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us: “As a share of GDP, which is really the way to look at this, deficits would decline from 12.4 of GDP in 2021 to 5.8 percent this year to 4.5 percent next year. But most of that action is due to two factors: The booming economy that is likely to increase revenues substantially and a sharp decline in pandemic-related spending/tax cuts.

“I suppose Biden gets some credit for this since he and the [Democrats in Congress] designed the American Rescue Plan to include temporary spending,” Gleckman said. “But it is not as if this year’s budget includes major spending reductions. In fact, many of his proposals would increase spending.”

Public Debt

While taking undue credit for the reduction in the size of annual deficits, Biden also boasted that the Treasury Department will pay down the public debt this quarter. “My Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor. Not once. Not once,” Biden said.

He’s right, but paying down the debt in one quarter won’t slow the tide of red ink. In fact, Treasury has also said that it expects to resume borrowing money next quarter.

Here are the facts: The federal debt held by the public is $23.8 trillion, up 10.2% from the $21.6 trillion that Biden inherited when he took office. On May 2, the Treasury Department announced that it will pay down $26 billion of the public debt in the April-June quarter. That’s the first time since the April-June 2016 quarter that the U.S. has repaid its public debt, according to Treasury Department data from the October-December quarter of 2015 to the April-June quarter of 2022.

But in the May 2 announcement, Treasury also said that it expects to borrow $182 billion next quarter (July-September) and that it borrowed $668 billion in the previous quarter (January-March). That means, for the first three quarters of this year, Treasury expects net borrowing to be $824 billion.

And the borrowing will continue.

The president’s proposed fiscal year 2023 budget estimates (see table 7.1) that the public debt will be $27.3 trillion at the end of Biden’s term in 2024. That would be an increase of roughly 26% from when Biden took office and about equal to the size of the nation’s gross domestic product.

Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

In contrasting his policy agenda with the Republicans’, the president criticized then-President Donald Trump’s signature piece of legislation — the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He said “the last time they were in power,” referring to Republicans, “their top priority was the reckless $2 trillion tax cut … and not a penny of it was paid for.”

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by Congress and signed by Trump on Dec. 22, 2017, lowered many individual tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, eliminated personal exemptions and increased child tax credits, among other changes. It also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

But it also raised tax revenues in order to offset some costs.

For example, these business tax changes were designed to increase tax revenue over 10 years, according to the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation’s Dec. 18, 2017, analysis of the final bill days before it became law:

$253.4 billion: Limit net interest deductions to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income, carryforward of denied deduction.

Limit net interest deductions to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income, carryforward of denied deduction. $201.1 billion: Modification of net operating loss deduction.

Modification of net operating loss deduction. $119.7 billion: Amortization of research and experimental expenditures.

Amortization of research and experimental expenditures. $98 billion: Repeal of deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities.

As for individual taxpayers, the law capped the itemized deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, and eliminated the deduction for personal and dependent exemptions. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that eliminating the personal exemptions alone would raise $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

The net cost of the law, the JCT estimated at the time, was $1.46 trillion. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in an April 2018 report, estimated the net cost at $1.9 trillion. The White House cited the CBO’s $1.9 trillion cost estimate when we asked about the president’s claim that “not a penny of it was paid for.”

It’s true that the tax cut law wasn’t fully paid for. But the tax law would have been much more costly if there weren’t provisions that increased taxes and offset some costs.

212,Biden Administration Rejects Recession Label for Economy - Voice of America - VOA News,Biden Administration Rejects Recession Label for Economy  Voice of America - VOA News,"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYmlkZW4tYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24tcmVqZWN0cy1yZWNlc3Npb24tbGFiZWwtZm9yLWVjb25vbXktLzY2Nzc3MzAuaHRtbNIBYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9iaWRlbi1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1yZWplY3RzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1sYWJlbC1mb3ItZWNvbm9teS0vNjY3NzczMC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Voice of America - VOA News,"U.S. President Joe Biden and members of his administration are avoiding the ""R word"" — recession — to describe the country's economy despite the release of government data showing a contraction for a second straight quarter, a traditional benchmark for a recession.

""There's going to be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession,"" Biden told a group of business leaders gathered at the White House on Thursday afternoon. ""But if you look at our job market, consumer spending [and] business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter, as well.""

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, earlier speaking to reporters next door at the Department of the Treasury, said ""most economists and most Americans have a similar definition of recession — substantial job losses and mass layoffs, businesses shutting down, private sector activity slowing considerably, family budgets under immense strain. In sum, a broad-based weakening of our economy. That is not what we're seeing right now.""

Yellen, responding to a reporter, also said, ""We should avoid a semantic battle"" over whether the economy is in recession.

The recession rhetoric, however, was amplified on Thursday after the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported gross domestic product of the United States — the broad measure of goods and services produced in the country — shrank at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.9% in the April through June period. That follows a 1.6% decline in this year's first quarter.

""Popularly, we are in a recession because most people think that a recession involves two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. And we've got that,"" Desmond Lachman, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA.

Consumer sentiment ""now is close to record low levels. They're struggling with high inflation. The wages are getting eroded. They've lost a lot of money on the stock exchange. So, consumers don't feel good about the economy,"" Lachman added.

Recessions in the United States are officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), but such determinations are made in retrospect. Its definition of a recession is based on a significant decline in economic activity over numerous months, taking into consideration such factors as employment, output, retail sales and household income.

""[The NBER] only make that judgment something like six months or a year after the numbers look like they're indicating the recession,"" said Lachman. ""So, in short, it's too early to say that we're officially in a recession.""

Yellen agreed, telling reporters, ""They'll decide it sometime in the future.""

In the meantime, economists outside the government and elected officials are free to spin the numbers to make their own declarations.

""The Biden White House can play word games and try and contort the English language as it sees fit in order to advance its radical and harmful agenda,"" said Steve Moore, an economist with FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. ""What this administration cannot change is the fact that American consumer confidence continues to fall under Biden's watch. Americans are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the state of the Biden economy, and no wordplay over the definition of 'recession' can change that.""

Numerous Republican members of Congress tweeted immediately after the data was released to declare the country is now in a recession.

""Democrats threw us into recession,"" said Senator Ted Cruz, a member of the Senate's Joint Economic Committee.

""Biden and his army of woke journalists can obscure this all they want, but they cannot escape this fact: America is in a recession,"" declared Representative Carlos Gimenez, a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. ""Hardworking American families deserve so much better than what this administration has put us through in the last year.""

""The U.S. is officially in a recession, thanks to the Democrats' reckless spending. Americans are suffering because of Joe Biden's America-last policies,"" said Representative Jeff Duncan, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Inflation in the country hit a 40-year high of 9.1% last month. The country's central bank, the Federal Reserve, hiked interest rates on Wednesday by three-quarters of a percent, its latest such increase to try to tame price hikes, but a move some economists warn could trigger a recession.

""The problem with the Federal Reserve is they do too little, too late,"" according to Lachman. ""By the time that they started raising interest rates at the beginning of this year, the inflation genie was well out of the bottle — we had multi-decade highs in the inflation rate. The same thing is now occurring this time around that the Fed keeps raising interest rates, even though there are rather clear signs that the economy is slowing.""

Lachman, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, added that the actions by the Federal Reserve have put a lot of developing economies under pressure as capital that had flowed to those countries has returned to the United States, and a stronger dollar is making it difficult for them to fund their balance of payment deficits.

""Once the United States economy slows, it means that the export markets for the emerging market countries isn't as robust as it was before. So, we could see difficulty for the emerging market, certainly the remainder of this year. But there might be relief next year, once the Fed stops this interest rate hiking cycle and begins cutting interest rates,"" predicted Lachman.

Yellen told reporters she is also worried about the global outlook.

Rising interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar ""can create pressures in other parts of the world, especially at a time when all of us are suffering from the impacts of Putin's war that are driving up energy and food prices and creating real burdens on most countries around the world, and particularly the lowest income countries,"" she said.

213,Fact check: Biden falsely claims US has 'fastest-growing economy in the world' - CNN,Fact check: Biden falsely claims US has 'fastest-growing economy in the world'  CNN,"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi8xMC9wb2xpdGljcy9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWJpZGVuLWZhc3Rlc3QtZ3Jvd2luZy1lY29ub215LWppbW15LWtpbW1lbC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNi8xMC9wb2xpdGljcy9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWJpZGVuLWZhc3Rlc3QtZ3Jvd2luZy1lY29ub215LWppbW15LWtpbW1lbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"Washington CNN —

In a Wednesday appearance on the ABC late-night show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” President Joe Biden made a dramatic claim about the US economy – and repeated himself for emphasis.

“Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest-growing economy in the world. The world. The world,” Biden said.

Facts First: Biden’s claim is false. The US economy grew by 5.7% in 2021, but more than 50 other countries had faster growth that year, figures published by the International Monetary Fund show; many of them are small or developing countries, but some of them are large or wealthy. In addition, the US economy shrank in the first quarter of 2022, while various other countries experienced growth. And while economic experts expect the US economy to resume growing over the rest of this year, a significant number of other countries are expected to grow faster.

Asked for comment on Friday, a White House official did not attempt to specifically defend Biden’s claim that the US has the fastest-growing economy in the world.

Instead, the official pointed out that the 5.7% growth in the United States’ real gross domestic product in 2021 was the fastest for the country since 1984. The official also pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has projected that, as of the fourth quarter of this year, the size of the US economy will be bigger relative to its late-2019 pre-pandemic level than any of the other six countries in the international forum known as the Group of Seven: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

Those comments are accurate. But Biden said on Kimmel’s show, three times, that the US economy is growing faster than that of any other country in “the world,” not just growing faster than six particular countries. And that’s inaccurate.

“Clearly the US has been the G-7 economy that has done best in terms of GDP growth rates since the inception of COVID, but is not literally the fastest-growing economy in the world over this period,” said Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, a former International Monetary Fund official who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank’s Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy.

How the US compares

Biden took office in late January 2021. Among the dozens of countries that saw faster real GDP growth than the US in 2021 were Ireland (13.5%), Chile (11.7%), Turkey (11%), Colombia (10.6%), India (8.7% for the fiscal year that began in April 2021), Greece (8.3%), Israel (8.2%), China (8.1%), the United Kingdom (7.4%), France (7%) and Italy (6.6%), according to figures published by the IMF and the countries’ governments. (Many countries’ growth rates were higher than usual in 2021 because their economies were rebounding from the 2020 economic crisis caused by the pandemic.)

An economic outlook released this week by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development projected the US would grow by 2.5% in 2022. That was lower than the OECD’s 2022 projections for 11 other members of the Group of 20 international forum: Saudi Arabia (7.8%), India (6.9% for the fiscal year), Indonesia (4.7%), China (4.4%), Australia (4.2%), Spain (4.1%), Canada (3.8%), Turkey (3.7%), the United Kingdom (3.6%), Argentina (3.6%) and South Korea (2.7%).

We’ll add one caveat. There are various ways to measure growth – among other things, you can pick different start and end points and different gauges of economic activity – and there are various complications involved in the data.

Laura Veldkamp, a finance professor at Columbia University’s business school, said there is “no way” that Biden’s claim is true if he was using “fastest-growing” in the usual way, referring to a percentage change. She said, however, that she would personally describe the President’s claim as “misleading,” rather than false, since “the word growth in conversation can mean many things.”

We’ll respectfully stick with our harsher conclusion. If Biden was citing some unusual or obscure measure of growth, he could have explained that. He didn’t, and the White House didn’t either when asked for comment."
214,AP-NORC poll: Low marks for Biden on economy as prices rise - The Associated Press,AP-NORC poll: Low marks for Biden on economy as prices rise  The Associated Press,"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3J1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLXB1dGluLWJpZGVuLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNvbmdyZXNzLWRjYTZiMWViYTQ5NzliY2VjOGJlZjFhODBjOWYwMDk40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A majority of Americans say they don’t blame President Joe Biden for high gasoline prices, but they’re giving his economic leadership low marks amid fears of inflation and deep pessimism about economic conditions.

About 7 in 10 Americans say the nation’s economy is in bad shape, and close to two-thirds disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. In addition, Americans are more likely to say his policies have hurt the economy than helped it.

Yet less than half say the jump in gas prices is Biden’s fault, a reflection of how the country is processing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting increase in oil costs.

The polls hints at a paradox in which the public views Biden as being in power without necessarily being in control. His hopes for a lasting economic renaissance have faded as Americans cope with higher food and energy costs. And the promise of a country no longer under the pandemic’s sway has been supplanted by the uncertainty of war in Europe.

“It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” said Adam Newago, 53, a truck driver from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He sees inflation as spiraling outward with higher fuel prices increasing the costs of shipping and ultimately raising prices across the broader economy.

Newago said he reluctantly voted for President Donald Trump in 2020, while his wife cast her ballot for Biden. He feels that inflation at a 40-year high and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan have led to a “mess.”

Overall, 65% of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of the nation’s economy, including 96% of Republicans and 36% of Democrats. The overall share saying they disapprove is up from 57% in December of 2021 and from 47% last July.

Gas prices stand above other types of inflation when it comes to the worries ordinary Americans have about price increases impacting their bottom lines. A hefty 68% said they’re very concerned about gas prices, while 59% expressed the same degree of worry about rising grocery prices.

Gas prices were high before Putin began amassing forces at the Ukrainian border, but they’ve risen since the start of the war without producing a slew of additional oil to come onto the market.

Tammy Baca, 52, who works in education in Fort Worth, Texas, said that prices at the pump are a function of the geopolitics.

“You’re going to have to suffer, you know?” said Baca, a Democrat. “It’s almost like we’re pitching in for wartime effort, without even being at war.”

Many Americans agree, with 55% saying it’s a bigger priority for the U.S. to effectively sanction Russia than to limit damage to the U.S. economy.

Shelter is the dominant expenditure in the government’s measure of inflation, but less than half of Americans — 40% — say they’re very concerned about higher than usual housing costs impacting their household finances. Another 24% are somewhat concerned.

Fifty-three percent of Americans also say they’re very concerned about higher prices for other goods and services.

Overall, Americans are more likely to say that higher than usual gas prices are more because of factors outside of Biden’s control than because of Biden’s policies, 55% to 44%.

Still, more think Biden’s policies are hurting the economy than helping it, 48% to 24%. Another 28% say they haven’t made much difference. The rejection comes after Biden steered a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package and $1 trillion infrastructure package through Congress, though his agenda on economic equity and clean energy stalled in Congress last December.

For Jennifer Smith, the relief package was a financial lifeline. The 50-year-old lives off disability and lives with her daughter in Zanesville, Ohio. Smith voted for Trump in 2020, but she disliked the Jan. 6, 2020, assault on the U.S. Capitol. She not only received a direct payment from the government but $250 monthly in the expanded child tax credit — both of which have disappeared while the inflation has stayed.

“I know this sounds crazy, but I’m thrilled to be able to pay bills,” Smith said. “With the way it is right now, I can’t without borrowing, robbing Peter to pay Paul.”

Eighty-eight percent of Democrats say high gas prices are outside Biden’s control, while 79% of Republicans specifically blame his policies, which many said in follow-up interviews limited U.S. energy production. Most Republicans say Biden’s policies are hurting the economy, but among Democrats, 45% say they’re helping and 39% say they’re not making much difference.

The poll suggests support among Democrats for Biden’s economic leadership is decidedly lukewarm, especially among those under 45. That’s a meaningful difference from the loyalty that the GOP expressed for Trump — who in March 2018 enjoyed an 84% approval on the economy from his fellow Republicans.

In yet another sign of how partisanship is shaping views of the economy and inflation, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they’re very concerned about the impact on their households from higher prices for gas, groceries, housing, and other goods and services.

Overall, 69% of Americans say that the nation’s economy is in poor shape, compared with 31% who say it’s good. The share saying the economy is poor has ticked up slightly from 64% in December. Still, 63% call their personal financial situation good, a number that has stayed remarkably steady since before the COVID-19 pandemic.

As for Biden, his supporters say he’s been held back by Congress and the challenges created by the disruptions and crises that are part of the U.S. presidency.

Mary Payne, 75, a nurse in California, said she wouldn’t say Biden’s performance has been “excellent,” though it’s been “good” and “probably fair.” She said she opposed Trump in 2020 and views the Republicans right now as obstructive.

“I don’t know how many roadblocks are put up for him doing what he wants to do,” Payne said. “I think the heart is there. I think that he cares.”

A majority of Americans tell pollsters they feel the economy is not in good shape and getting worse. People are now demonstrably poorer than when President Joe Biden took office. Although wages have risen, prices have risen much faster.

Worse, these are self-inflicted wounds. To find their source, look no further than the man steering the ship: President Biden. On his first day in office, Biden grasped the helm and turned it hard to port—that is, a sharp left turn. In doing so, he turned the economy into the wind.

By canceling pipelines, threatening American energy companies with extinction, forestalling drilling leases and creating a hostile environment for producers, Biden has appeased his far-left supporters—but left the rest of America holding the bag.

Biden has fought the construction of pipelines tooth and nail, preventing the replacement of aging infrastructure while also rendering proposed wells essentially useless. Drilling an oil or gas well is futile if the driller cannot build a pipeline to carry the product. Likewise, Biden’s repeated threats to eliminate fossil fuels with crippling taxes and regulation have chilled investment. No one wants to build a refinery that will take years to recoup its initial costs when that refinery will be closed by government edict relatively soon.

>>> Biden’s Inflation Plan Filled With Inaccuracies, Warped Analysis, and Flawed Solutions

Biden has also canceled drilling leases or missed deadlines for announcing plans on new leases. In an industry where investment requirements are routinely measured in the tens of billions of dollars, this uncertainty makes it nearly impossible to invest and increase production.

This 180-degree move for the economy has also turned the strong tailwind of American energy independence into an equally strong headwind with skyrocketing energy prices.

Affordable, reliable domestic energy has been an economic boon for America, but it is being shunned in favor of unaffordable and unreliable alternatives. Since energy affects the price of everything we buy, this leftward turn by the Biden administration is raising costs for Americans. Politicians grossly underestimate how much energy costs impact prices and affect economic output. By steering the ship of state directly into the wind, the Biden administration has stalled economic progress and moved the country backward.

The consequences of the administration’s approach to energy are precisely the opposite of the free market, which has proven time and again that it can turn headwinds into tailwinds. Take gasoline. Its main components used to be waste products from refining kerosene. Their disposal was both unsafe and environmentally damaging. But without any government edicts, the free market found a use for these petroleum distillates and turned a hazardous waste product into one of the most widely used commodities worldwide. This drastically reduced transportation costs and has made transit affordable for billions around the globe.

But miracles like this are far less likely when bureaucrats take command and ideologically steer the ship where they want it to go, as opposed to where millions of other people would like it to go. As the Biden administration continues to force the nation off reliable, domestic energy sources, the tailwinds of abundant American energy are now the headwinds of “green” energy boondoggles, pushing America into a recession.

>>> The Unsustainable Costs of President Biden’s Climate Agenda

Yet the White House press secretary insists “we’re not in a recession right now,” despite many indicators to the contrary. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which maintains a model forecasting economic growth, is predicting that the economy contracted again during the second quarter of 2022, the three-month period from April through June. This follows the contraction of 1.6 percent in the first quarter, from January through March.

A recession, which occurs when the economy contracts for two consecutive quarters, simply means that there are fewer goods and services being produced. Artificially elevated energy prices are making the same goods and services more expensive, so that less are being produced, and less can be consumed. That means standards of living and quality of life decline, even though you may be working just as hard as before. Or you may not be working at all, since recessions also entail unemployment as businesses need fewer employees.

The first official estimate for second-quarter economic growth will be released on July 28 and will likely show that the nation is already in a recession. Yet the ship of state can easily get underway again by once more sailing with the wind. For that to happen, the Biden administration needs to relinquish the helm and take its boot off the necks of America’s great energy producers."
216,How Do Economists Determine Whether the Economy Is in a Recession? | CEA - The White House,How Do Economists Determine Whether the Economy Is in a Recession? | CEA  The White House,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlaG91c2UuZ292L2NlYS93cml0dGVuLW1hdGVyaWFscy8yMDIyLzA3LzIxL2hvdy1kby1lY29ub21pc3RzLWRldGVybWluZS13aGV0aGVyLXRoZS1lY29ub215LWlzLWluLWEtcmVjZXNzaW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The White House,"What is a recession? While some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession, that is neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle. Instead, both official determinations of recessions and economists’ assessment of economic activity are based on a holistic look at the data—including the labor market, consumer and business spending, industrial production, and incomes. Based on these data, it is unlikely that the decline in GDP in the first quarter of this year—even if followed by another GDP decline in the second quarter—indicates a recession.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee—the official recession scorekeeper—defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” The variables the committee typically tracks include real personal income minus government transfers, employment, various forms of real consumer spending, and industrial production. Notably, there are no fixed rules or thresholds that trigger a determination of decline, although the committee does note that in recent decades, they have given more weight to real personal income less transfers and payroll employment.

Also, because the committee depends on government statistics that are reported at various lags, it cannot officially designate a recession until after it starts.[1] So how might the NBER committee assess the health of the economy?

Figure 1 shows the trend in four of the NBER committee’s recession-indicator variables—real income minus transfers, real spending, industrial production, and employment—relative to their values in April 2020 (the trough of the last recession, and thus, the month before the current expansion began). All of these indicators have exhibited strong growth in the U.S. economy since the start of the pandemic, and have continued to expand through the first half of this year. And while real income net of transfers has been flat in recent months, industrial production, employment, and real spending have grown this year. The committee does not directly consider inflation; however, it is embedded in the real income and spending variables it tracks, including those plotted in Figure 1. Those data show that while inflation is highly elevated, real spending is still growing, powered by one of the strongest labor markets on record and an elevated stock of household savings.

The fact that the NBER committee looks for a “significant decline” in activity that is broad-based puts this year’s 1.6 percent rate contraction in first quarter real GDP into context. Far from being a broad contraction, the negative estimate of the growth rate was a function of inventories—one of the noisiest components of GDP growth[2]—and net exports, in part reflecting our economic strength relative to that of our trading partners, as well as less snarled global supply chains. Private domestic final demand—consumer spending and fixed investment (which together make up over 80 percent of nominal GDP)—grew at a 3.0 percent real annualized rate in the first quarter, demonstrating solid, above-trend growth. And payroll employment grew at an even stronger 4.7 percent annualized rate, followed by 3.4 percent in Q2. In fact, the 1.1 million jobs created in the second quarter—an average of around 375,000 jobs per month—is more than three times more jobs created than in any three-month period leading up to a recession.

Finally, although the unemployment rate is not on the committee’s list, the fact that it has held at a historically low 3.6 percent in the past four months also has bearing on the recession question. A widely cited indicator of recessions (the “Sahm rule” named after economist Claudia Sahm) maintains that a recession is likely underway when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by at least half a percentage point (50 basis points) relative to its lowest point in the previous 12 months. The fact that the Sahm indicator is 0, far below its 50 basis-point threshold, provides yet another indication that the economic expansion is ongoing.

Recession probabilities are never zero, but trends in the data through the first half of this year used to determine a recession are not indicating a downturn.

Looking ahead, we know that the U.S., along with the rest of the global economy, faces significant headwinds—and little relevant data are yet available on the third quarter (2022Q3). At the same time, there is a good chance that the strength of the labor market and of consumer balance sheets help the economy transition from the rapid growth of the last year to steadier and more stable growth. But, whatever path the economy takes, CEA will continue to carefully track these indicators to assess the state of the economic cycle.

[1] In fact, when recessions are short-lived, the committee typically announces them after they are over.

[2] Inventories in the GDP accounts reflect not a level change, as for example, with consumer spending, but a change in a change, i.e., whether inventories were growing or shrinking faster or slower than the previous quarter. In fact, the level of inventories rose in 2022 Q1, just not as fast as in the previous quarter."
217,Biden is close to the point of no return with Americans on the economy - CNN,Biden is close to the point of no return with Americans on the economy  CNN,"Thu, 05 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wNS9wb2xpdGljcy9iaWRlbi1lY29ub215LWFuYWx5c2lzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUJodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA1LzA1L3BvbGl0aWNzL2JpZGVuLWVjb25vbXktYW5hbHlzaXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"CNN —

President Joe Biden and his administration appear perilously close to an irreversible severing of public confidence in his capacity to deliver prosperity and financial security as stiff economic challenges balloon into huge political liabilities.

A CNN poll released Wednesday shows that the President’s repeated efforts to highlight undeniably strong aspects of the economy’s post-pandemic rebound and to offset blame for its bad spots aren’t working.

The main culprit is inflation, a corrosive force that the White House initially underestimated and has failed to tame. It’s been decades since Americans have experienced this demoralizing cycle of spiraling costs for basic goods and services. That shock is twinned with punishing gasoline prices that also hammer family budgets and spread pain across the population – in a way that a regular recession, which can destroy millions of jobs but not hurt everyone – may not.

The result is a looming political disaster for Democrats, with voters in a disgruntled mood ahead of midterm elections that were already historically tough for a first-term President.

The depth of voter disquiet about the economy also suggests that a potential backlash against the Supreme Court possibly overturning the nationwide right to abortion may not save Democrats in November.

The party seems stuck in a dangerous political position of insisting the economy is doing well while voters think it’s in the tank.

The CNN poll, conducted by SSRS from April 28 to May 1, showed that a majority of Americans think Biden’s policies have hurt the economy, while 8 in 10 say the government is not doing enough to combat inflation. It was released on the same day the Federal Reserve made its biggest swing against the rising cost of living in 22 years.

White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein admitted on CNN on Thursday that some households are “experiencing extreme discomfort” because of inflation, but said some were in a better position because of the strong job market.

“So I think you have to be more nuanced when you’re trying to assess the economy … we’re doing all we can to try to help ease these inflationary pressures,” Bernstein told Brianna Keilar on “New Day.” He pointed to White House efforts to end supply chain blockages, to tackle port congestion, to lower energy prices and the release of millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves among other measures.

Bernstein is right about the external factors pushing inflation. But the problem for the White House is that nuance is the first thing that goes missing in political campaigns and voter anguish offers an easy opening for Republicans.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point, but it triggered a stocks rally by indicating that despite adjustments to come, it did not anticipate further huge spikes in the price of borrowing.

“I’d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at the start of a news conference. “Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing. We are moving expeditiously to bring it back down.”

Yet the strikingly direct moment may not quell concerns that the Fed and the White House have acted too slowly to tackle inflation, are not using sufficiently aggressive methods to ease it and may still be overtaken by global factors, including the war in Ukraine and the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, which clogged supply chains, sent energy prices soaring and triggered other rising prices.

What the interest rate hike means

The rate increase will make new home and car loans and payments on credit card balances more expensive. But in the process, it could cool the housing market, making it easier to buy a home and taking the heat out of rising prices.

Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, explained that Americans could see results from the rate hikes in their daily lives, as inflation simmers at the highest levels since Ronald Reagan’s 1980s presidency.

“What the Fed is hoping to do is cool inflation a little so your paycheck will go a little further, although that will mean slowing the economy and that might mean a little less bargaining power for workers and fewer prospects of a wage rise anytime soon,” Wolfers said on CNN’s “Newsroom.”

The White House is showing clear signs of frustration that inflation is overshadowing the strong aspects of an economy that appears in remarkably robust shape – despite a small contraction of 1.4% in the first quarter – given the cataclysm of a two-year pandemic and the worst war in Europe since 1945.

Biden, for example, on Wednesday touted cuts in the federal budget deficit and an unemployment rate that is approaching 50-year lows in a speech that appeared to be an attempt to get ahead of the Fed announcement and to signal resolve.

Yet his political plight is underscoring why inflation remains a force that is dreaded by political leaders everywhere.

Despite Republican claims in midterm campaign ads that Biden’s public spending policies are the sole cause of inflation, the President is correct to identify outside factors, including the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, as the main drivers of rising prices.

But the reality doesn’t mean voters will give Biden a pass. It’s the nature of the job that when the country is in a grim mood, the President gets the blame. And when the White House’s efforts to explain the problems and fix them have sometimes been muddled and too late, the political damage mounts. Biden may never shake off the initial White House line that high inflation was a “transitory” phase coming out of the pandemic. And while the economy is strong in many areas, voters’ perception is often more important politically than the data that tells the real story.

A daunting poll for the White House

The CNN poll, for example, says that only 23% of Americans rate economic conditions as even somewhat good, down from 37% in December. The last time public perception of the economy was this poor in CNN’s polling was November 2011. Only 34% approve of Biden’s management of the economy. And his approval rating on helping the middle class – 36% – is devastating for a President who has made that issue the foundation of his political career.

The question of public perception versus the true state of the economy is also borne out in the poll. Americans said by nearly 4 to 1 that they were more likely to hear bad news than good news about the economy.

Some 94% of Republicans rate economic conditions as poor. This suggests that views of the economy may be shaped by partisan leanings as much as a neutral judgment of conditions. Conservative news channels keep a constant drumbeat of horror stories about rising prices, and Republicans have made the issue an effective campaign tool while hyping the strength of ex-President Donald Trump’s economic performance.

Yet 81% of independents and 54% of Democrats also think the economy is poor, suggesting that Biden has taken a hit among some of the voters who put him in office.

Americans are more positive about their own finances than about the national economic situation, with 53% saying they’re satisfied with their personal financial situations. That could again indicate that a wider sense of malaise is coloring views of the economy. Still, that figure is down from 66% in 2016.

Given this catalog of gloom, Biden’s tone and topic on Wednesday were a little surprising.

He claimed credit for a $1.5 trillion cut in the federal deficit by the end of the year. This compares with the profligacy of the debt-laden Trump years and exposes the hypocrisy of Republican deficit hawks who forget their supposed principles when one of their own is in the Oval Office.

Yet how many Americans stretching their weekly budgets care that much about deficits – even if, as Biden said, lowering them could bring down inflation in the long term?

The White House event also exposed the President’s frustration that he’s not getting credit for what’s good about the economy.

When a reporter asked him about Ukraine and the Supreme Court’s abortion drama, he replied: “No one asked about deficits, huh? … You want to make sure this doesn’t get covered.”

What happens next

The best hope for Biden, other Democratic politicians and all Americans facing an economic crunch is that the Fed’s approach works and prices fall. And some perspective here: The economy isn’t facing the full-blown disaster of 2008 or even the inflationary nightmares of 40 years ago.

“I don’t think we have the economy of the 1980s or the 1970s,” Betsey Stevenson, who was a member of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, said on “The Lead with Jake Tapper” on Wednesday.

But it’s hard to see how things get better quickly – or anywhere near in time to make a difference to Biden before the midterms.

Even if the war in Ukraine ends soon, the fundamental shifts it has unleashed in the global economy will play out for years. More pressure on food prices is certain if the harvest in Europe’s breadbasket – a major source of grain and sunflower oil – is disrupted by the war. New Covid-19 lockdowns in China could revive supply chain chaos that helped push up inflation in the first place. Some observers think the Fed has moved too slowly. Others think that its assault on inflation will cause a recession.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, appearing on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday before the Fed’s announcement, said that although the economy is strong and consumers are in good shape, vulnerabilities are everywhere. He sees, for instance, a 1 in 3 chance of a “mild recession” that spans six to nine months but warned there’s “a chance it’s going to be much harder than that.”

So for the country, and for Biden especially, there’s more frustration to come."
218,"Biden sees economy avoiding recession, but risks remain - The Associated Press","Biden sees economy avoiding recession, but risks remain  The Associated Press","Fri, 02 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JpZGVuLWJ1c2luZXNzLWVjb25vbXktZ292ZXJubWVudC1hbmQtcG9saXRpY3MtZmU1ZjY1N2IwMzZiMmI2MTJkMDcyMzY4NTg0ZTAwY2TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden assured Americans on Friday that the U.S. economy is chugging along in the holiday season, but the very strength of a new jobs report showed that high inflation remains a recession threat.

At the White House, the president signed an emergency bill to avert a rail strike that he said could have caused 765,000 job losses in two weeks and plunged the country into a painful downturn. But many voters and economists still fear that a recession is nigh and the price of reducing high prices will be layoffs.

Biden pointed to the addition of 263,000 jobs in November — with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7% — as proof that his policies have bulked up the economy. He suggested that the major recession risk was the freight rail strike, a problem the country avoided by having Congress impose an agreement that raises pay but fails to provide the additional paid sick leave that workers demanded.

“Things are moving — they’re moving in the right direction,” Biden said. “As we go into the holiday season, here’s what this all means: The Americans are working, the economy is growing.”

White House officials do see reason for optimism. Gasoline prices are averaging $3.45 a gallon, down sharply from a June peak, according to AAA. The economy is expanding after shrinking in size during the first half of the year. And since July, workers’ average hourly earnings have been rising faster than consumer prices.

But inflation can be a game of whack-a-mole, and Friday’s employment report suggested that wage growth actually could be part of the problem.

Inflation has been something of a moving target during Biden’s presidency. Supply chain challenges and shortages pushed up prices as the country started to recover from the pandemic in 2021. Higher oil and food costs drove up inflation after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. And the jobs report showed that wage growth accelerated sharply, which could fuel inflation going forward.

The Federal Reserve is attempting to reduce inflation by raising its benchmark interest rates. That action reduces economic activity in order to bring down prices.

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the U.S. central bank might not have to raise rates as aggressively to return inflation to the 2% annual target. That comment caused the stock market to rise, only for the optimism to fizzle out on Friday as the new and revised wage data indicated the Fed might need to do more to cool the economy.

“With these revisions, the pace of wage growth is more consistent with 5% inflation than with 2% inflation,” said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, formerly the top economist in the Obama White House. “In this sense it may take a larger adjustment in labor markets than previously hoped to bring inflation down.”

The president’s key message is that his policies have helped to avoid catastrophes such as a recession caused by a rail strike. The bill he signed Friday binds rail companies and workers to a proposed settlement that was reached between the railroads and union leaders in September but rejected by the workers of some unions.

“The bill I’m about to sign ends a difficult rail dispute and helps our nation avoid what without a doubt would have been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar,” said Biden. He said his team helped negotiate a “good product, but we still have more work to do in my view.”

Members of four of the 12 unions involved had rejected the proposed contract as lacking sufficient paid sick leave, setting up the possibility of a strike beginning Dec. 9. Biden acknowledged the shortcoming and said he would continue to push for that benefit for every U.S. worker.

“I’ve supported paid sick leave for a long time,” said the president, a staunch labor union supporter. “I’m going to continue that fight until we succeed.”

He said that Republican lawmakers blocked the inclusion of seven days of paid sick leave in the agreement, and it’s unclear how he would get backing for expanding family leave to all workers with the GOP winning the House majority in November’s elections.

Republican leaders have tapped into deep doubts about the U.S. economy with party officials noting that higher prices have caused Americans’ savings rate to hit the lowest level in 17 years. About three-quarters of voters last month called economic conditions “poor” or “not so good,” according to AP VoteCast.

Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, called the jobs report a “nightmare before Christmas.”

“The White House is absolutely clueless about the very real labor shortage still hurting Main Street businesses and driving prices higher,” Brady said. “And for many workers, they are struggling with real wage losses and real pay cuts, making sticker shock a big part of this year’s holiday gift shopping experience.”

Although Biden has said the economy is heading in the right direction, the employment report indicates that it’s on a “more muddled path” in which it’s unclear whether a downturn and eventual job losses can be averted, said Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor, an employment website.

The mixed signals come in part because the employment report comes from two surveys. The survey of employer payrolls shows how many jobs were added, while a separate survey of households determines the unemployment rate.

The two surveys have diverged with the household numbers indicating the economy has actually lost jobs over the past two months, contradicting the gains seen in the establishments survey.

Zhao said the economy doesn’t look as though it is about to tip into recession, but the risk is that when job figures are revised next year policymakers could learn in hindsight that the U.S. was shedding jobs as the Fed continued to raise rates.

“These surveys are out of sync at a critical turning point in the economy,” he said."

President Joe Biden on Thursday dismissed fears that the US is in a recession after a government report showed the US economy shrunk again in the second quarter, arguing there are “signs of economic progress,” including in the labor market and consumer spending.

The President said slower growth was expected compared to last year amid the nation’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and said it was “consistent with the transition to a stable, steady growth and lower inflation.”

“There are going to be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession,” Biden said. “But if you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter as well.”

The nation’s gross domestic product fell by 0.9% on an annualized basis from April through June, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. While there is no steadfast rule governing what defines a recession in the United States, it is commonly understood to be two consecutive quarters of the country’s gross domestic product shrinking. But a small group of economists on the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially define when the US economy is in a recession, and they define a recession as involving “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”

The White House has been trying for weeks to downplay the significance of Thursday’s GDP report, arguing the data does not reflect the latest progress the nation’s economy has made, including the recent drop in gas prices across the nation. Top Biden administration officials continue to insist the economy is not in recession amid rampant inflation.

Biden hosted a group of CEOs from five major US businesses Thursday afternoon to discuss the economy following the gross domestic product report. The leaders of Corning, Marriott International, Bank of America, TIAA, and Deloitte will be present, according to a list of participants shared with CNN. Corning CEO Wendell Weeks and Marriott CEO Tony Capuano will attend the event in-person. Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett, and Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen will participate virtually.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Cecilia Rouse also attended the meeting.

Shortly after Biden spoke, the House of Representatives voted to pass the CHIPS Act, a bill aimed at boosting US semiconductor production in a bid to increase American competitiveness. Biden said during his speech he applauded the bipartisan effort to get the bill passed, and argued it was the kind of action Congress needed to take to ensure “steady, stable growth.”

Biden said earlier on Thursday that the nation was “on the right path” despite recession fears.

“Coming off of last year’s historic economic growth – and regaining all the private sector jobs lost during the pandemic crisis – it’s no surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Reserve acts to bring down inflation,” Biden said in a statement released Thursday.

He continued, “But even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure.”

Biden on Thursday also urged congressional Democrats to quickly pass the surprise agreement on a health care and energy spending bill that has breathed new life into his legislative agenda.

The Inflation Reduction Act was announced Wednesday evening by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. It represents a major breakthrough in negotiations that have been ongoing for more than a year and contains a number of Democratic priorities, including investing $369 billion into energy and climate change programs, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. The bill will face fierce GOP opposition, but stands a real chance of becoming law as soon as August.

The latest GDP reading comes one day after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a second time this year in an attempt to tame rampant inflation. Wednesday’s rate hike represents the first time in modern Fed history that the central bank has raised interest rates by 75 basis points twice in a row.

It also comes the same week another key economic indicator showed consumer confidence slipped for the third straight month.

National Economic Council Director Brian Deese on Thursday argued that although economic growth is slowing, the economy as a whole is showing “extraordinary resilience,” and pointed to the jobs the nation has added in the past year.

“We are in a transition, there’s no doubt. The economy is slowing and that is what most expected when coming off of an extremely strong and fast recovery last year. But all of the indications that we see right now are for an economy that’s showing extraordinary resilience in the face of global challenges,” Deese told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on “CNN Newsroom.”

He added, “The most important thing we can do right now … is to move on historic legislation that would lower costs and help encourage greater business investment over the long term.”"

This is a cruel economy for workers, families, and especially seniors.

“This is terrible news for workers, for families, certainly for seniors as well. Here we are nearly a year after President Biden promised Americans that inflation had peaked. Here we have core inflation at the highest on record during his presidency. “It is clearly housing costs that are just crushing – both rents and housing – and mortgage rates are now at a 20-year high. Health care saw a nearly 30 percent increase in one year. That’s the highest level on record. That’s crushing for seniors and working families. “So what’s in the pipeline that drives inflation? A couple of things: A wage-price spiral. No one wants to be in that because, ultimately, it drives inflation high, and it ends up in a recession. We also have a worker shortage driving inflation in a big way. At the end of day, I worry the president’s really misleading Americans about the severity of inflation and how cruel the economy he created really is.”

President Biden is going to continue pursuing punishing policies that make inflation worse.

“It’s troubling that President Biden says that everything’s fine, he’ll just stay on course. But the truth of the matter is we know there’s a different course – after our Republican tax cuts, we saw the economy growing, not shrinking. We saw more workers connect to jobs, not fewer. We saw paychecks going up twice as fast as inflation, and we lifted millions of Americans out of poverty, exactly the opposite of what this President is doing today. “And yet President Biden still doesn’t understand the damage he’s doing.

Over the last few months, unflattering stickers of President Biden have been popping up at gas stations across America. They've been spotted in places like Georgia, Ohio, Idaho, and along I-95 between Washington, D.C., and Florida. The stickers typically show Biden pointing at the price of gas, saying ""I did that!"" We saw one last weekend while filling up at a gas station in Vallejo, California:

It's hard to say how widespread use of these stickers actually is, but they're all over the Internet. If you search ""Biden sticker"" on Google, they immediately pop up. In between TikTok videos of orangutans driving golf carts and a chipmunk named Squishy filling up his cheeks with nuts, there are hundreds of videos of TikTokers placing ""I did that!"" stickers on gas pumps. Dozens of online merchants sell packs of them on sites like Amazon and Etsy, usually for around 8 or 9 bucks for 100 stickers.

Etsy seller JolieJamesStyle typically sells ""handmade jewelry with healing properties,"" but now they're selling Biden ""I did that!"" stickers. Kara Allbaugh, who owns a small design and marketing company in Columbus, Nebraska, says she started a secondary business selling these stickers on Etsy back in October. She says they've been flying off the shelves. ""I don't know how long this will go on for, but it's still funny because now you can just put them on everything, not just gas,"" she says.

It's not just vandals, pranksters, and TikTokers trying to stick inflation blame on Biden. Last month, Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn), the ranking member of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, joined a virtual committee hearing with a background that featured the Biden ""I did that"" sticker prominently. ""Life is simply more expensive for Americans under the Biden administration,"" Stauber declared.

While it's clear that life has gotten more expensive under President Biden, it's much less clear whether or how much he is actually to blame for it. In his defense, life has gotten more expensive for the residents of pretty much every country, not just America. Gas prices are surging around the world. Food prices are surging around the world. Commodities. Manufactured goods...

Last week, new data revealed that the European Union was seeing a record-high inflation rate of 5% in December, the highest in its twenty-year history. Canada is seeing the highest rate of inflation in two decades. Ditto South Korea. Turkey. The United Kingdom. Countries, big and small, conservative-led and progressive-led, are grappling with surging consumer prices as global demand outstrips supply. It's one big global inflation-fest, and no single leader seems to have the power to stop it.

All these countries have one thing in common: they're all struggling to recover from a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that continues to disrupt the supply side of the economy, hampering the ability of businesses, workers, and the global supply chain to operate at full capacity and satisfy boomeranging consumer demand. Rather than putting a Biden ""I did that"" sticker on products with skyrocketing prices, it's probably more accurate to say ""COVID did that.""

That said, there is an ongoing, legitimate debate about the economic effects of President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Massive federal spending packages to provide relief from COVID began under President Trump and initially had bipartisan support. President Biden continued this spending spree with the American Rescue Plan, which supporters argue saved the economy and continues to fuel its rise. The White House says America's ""economic recovery is stronger and faster than anywhere else in the world."" Data backs this up. Economic growth has been significantly higher in the U.S. than in other advanced nations. The U.S. stock market surged almost 27% in 2021. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9%. On many measures, America's recovery looks great, and the recovery wouldn't have been as strong without all these extra Biden bucks sloshing around the economy.

But, at the same time, critics argue, all this money sloshing around led to excess demand for goods and services, contributing to supply chain overload, shortages, and rising inflation. The Pew Research Center finds that between 2019 and 2021, the U.S. saw one of the biggest inflation rate increases in the world, behind only Brazil and Turkey. The humongous surge in demand for durable goods seen in America over the last couple years was not seen in Europe or Asia, at least not at the same scale. Observers blame America's large stimulus packages, which dwarfed Europe's and gave many Americans a big chunk of money to spend. This money helped whet America's seemingly insatiable appetite for foreign-made products, which has been a major reason for the global shipping chaos that has been one cause of increasing prices.

Last week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that real wages for the average American worker — that is, the value of their paychecks after taking into account inflation — fell by 2.4 percent over the last year. Despite a tight labor market, pay raises, and millions of new jobs created, surging inflation eroded many Americans' standard of living in 2021.

""Inflation is a global challenge, appearing in virtually every developed nation as it emerges from the pandemic economic slump,"" President Biden said last week in a statement. ""America is fortunate that we have one of the fastest growing economies — thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan — which enables us to address price increases and maintain strong, sustainable economic growth. That is my goal and I am focused on reaching it every day.""

When it comes to gas prices, Biden has taken some steps to lower them, including releasing 50 million barrels of oil from America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and asking the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing nations to increase oil production (they said no). Conservatives and business groups want the president to do more to drill domestically, but even that likely wouldn't do much to budge the price of oil because it is largely set on the global stage. The president's powers are limited in lowering the price of oil.

On tackling inflation more broadly, the president's powers are also limited. Economists, including President Biden's own Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have suggested that lowering tariffs would help, but that would likely only make a small dent, especially while the global supply chain remains clogged. The power to tame inflation really resides with the Federal Reserve, which is independent. It can (and likely will) raise interest rates to try and bring prices down, but that will also likely mean an economic slowdown, pain for American workers, and a decline in stock, housing, and other asset markets.

It's A Crummy Time To Be A World Leader

Back in March — with the rollout of vaccines and the popular American Rescue Plan expected to put the wind back in America's sails — a newly elected Biden enjoyed a 59% approval rating, according to the Reuters/Ipsos polling tracker. But, over the last six months, the pandemic has refused to go quietly into the night and inflation has taken off. Biden now has a 45% approval rating.

Had everyone gotten vaccinated, or had the Delta and Omicron variants not burst onto the scene, the economy and President Biden's approval ratings might well look a lot better. Economists have been telling us since the beginning of the pandemic that the best way to recover from the pandemic is to end the pandemic. It's hard to end the pandemic when large chunks of society aren't cooperating.

Biden isn't alone among world leaders tanking in the polls. At the beginning of the pandemic, most leaders actually saw a rise in their poll numbers. Pollsters credited what's known as the ""rally-round-flag effect"" that tends to happen when nations face existential threats. But now leaders are struggling with surging prices and pandemic fatigue while the pandemic still rages.

Of the 13 global leaders tracked by Morning Consult, a polling company, only 5 have a net approval rating. An ideologically diverse group of leaders — from socialist Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez to centrist French President Emmanuel Macron to conservative U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to right-wing Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro — all now have approval ratings below 40%.

Unfortunately for President Biden, voters show a strong tendency to blame presidents for economic problems (and credit them for economic gains), whether or not their policies are the actual cause. The White House has been toying with a messaging strategy to try and deflect inflation blame onto the monopoly power and greed of Corporate America. So far, it doesn't seem to be working, and a report from The Washington Post says even some White House insiders dislike this approach. While monopoly power and greed do result in higher prices for consumers, there's no evidence to suggest that they've gotten worse and significantly driven prices up over the last year.

It's been said that sales of Halloween masks of presidential candidates can predict who will win presidential elections. If you're a Democrat, you should hope that sticker sales aren't a predictor for midterm elections."

Sometimes understanding political opinion is complicated. For example, electoral observers will be trying to comprehend the rise of Donald Trump in American politics for years to come.

The story of public opinion ahead of the 2022 midterms, on other hand, is, at this point, an easy one to understand: “It’s the economy, stupid,” and unless the economy improves, President Joe Biden and the Democrats are in major trouble.

Take a look at our latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The No. 1 issue is the economy, and nothing else is even close. Half of all respondents (50%) said it was the most important issue. The next closest was the war between Russia and Ukraine at 14%.

An examination of the inner workings of the poll reveals just how universal feelings about the economy are. It’s the top issue for every single one of the over 20 demographic and political groups we report out in our crosstabs. It’s as important to White Americans (50%) as it is to people of color (49%). It matters as much to people age 45 and under (51%) as to those 45 and older (48%). The list goes on.

I look at polls for a living, and you rarely see that type of universal agreement across groups.

What makes this especially amazing is how rapidly this concern over the economy developed and how rapidly it’s become more important to more Americans.

A year ago, 54% of Americans said the economy was good. Just 45% said it was bad.

Today, 23% say it is good, and a super majority of 77% believe it is bad. You’d have to go back a little over 10 years to find as many Americans saying the economy was in as bad shape.

Another way to see this change in action is to look at our CNN poll from November, which had the economy as the top issue, but only 36% of Americans put it at the top of their list. Whenever you see an issue jump in importance by 14 points in a relatively short period of time, you know it’s at the forefront of the American psyche.

But something else has also happened that speaks to the toxicity of the issue politically: the blame game.

The last time the economy was viewed in as bad of a shape as now was January 2012. Then-President Barack Obama had an approval rating of 47%. He was polling at 49% against Mitt Romney, his eventual GOP opponent in that year’s election.

Biden’s approval rating is at 41%, with a disapproval rating of 59%, according to our CNN poll.

Obama was polling better back then compared with Biden now not because voters cared less about the economy. In fact, Gallup polling at the time showed Americans cared significantly more about the economy than they do now.

But what’s different today is that a clear majority (55%) of Americans, according to our latest poll, believe Biden’s economic policies have worsened the shape of the economy.

A decade ago, a significantly lower 37% had the same belief of Obama’s policies and the economy.

Unfortunately for Biden and the Democrats, the problem is getting worse. In December, 45% believed Biden’s policies had worsened things. You could imagine a universe in which that percentage was survivable politically. But when 50% think the economy is the top issue and 55% think your policies have made things worse, that’s very difficult to overcome.

This shouldn’t be a surprise. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released last weekend found that 50% of US adults said Republicans were better able to handle the economy. Thirty-six percent said the same about Democrats.

You’ll notice that the 14-point edge for Republicans over Democrats on handling the economy is very similar to the 10-point gap between those who say Biden’s policies have hurt the economy (55%) and those who say they have either improved it (19%) or had no effect (26%).

It makes sense then that Republicans are sporting a rare lead on the generic congressional ballot.

There will no doubt be other political battles over the next six months until the midterm elections. The battle over abortion rights could end up being front and center, for example.

Republicans would be wise to keep their electoral eye on the economy, which they seem to try to be doing.

And with the worst inflation in 40 years, it will be difficult to displace the economy as the top issue. Given how poorly Biden and the Democrats are polling on the issue, that’s very good news for Republicans and very bad news for the Democrats."

Desan, Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law and an expert on monetary policy and the economy, to share her thoughts on the administration’s successes, failures, and agenda for the future.

Harvard Law Today: What has the administration done right so far?

Christine Desan: The Biden administration is clear-eyed about the tools it has to support well-being and productive exchange. Perhaps most striking, it is not afraid to use fiscal as well as monetary policy. Each has important distributive effects. We’ve relied on monetary policy since the financial crisis of 2008 to promote investment through the financial industry. That strategy has worked to boost capital markets but it has disproportionately benefited higher-income households whose investments there appreciated enormously. By the same token, the strategy privileged credit to those areas that are financed through the capital markets. Finally, the policy has also raised financial stability risk insofar as it encouraged corporations to increase their indebtedness and required investors to pursue riskier investments to achieve the returns they sought.

Fiscal policy allows the country to climb out of that trap. Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill addresses a critical shortfall: our transit systems, roads and bridges, energy grid, broadband, and climate change amelioration — all need work. (The American Society of Civil Engineers gave us a C- on our infrastructure this year.) While emergency funds to individuals in 2020 staved off disaster, investment in infrastructure is forward-looking and creates good jobs. It’s a win-win that the great majority of Americans support, and Biden is right to keep pushing for more. In fact, such spending could actually be anti-inflationary insofar as it promotes economic activity and productivity.

While we’re on the fiscal point, I’d give Biden’s efforts on tax reform a shout-out, including the notion that we should augment the expertise and capacity of the IRS. We badly need to build a more equitable tax system. But even those invested in the status quo should consider how closely taxation is tied to robust markets. Historically, it is exactly those governments that create public demand for their currency with strong revenue systems that become financial juggernauts — the U.K. in the 19th century, the U.S. in the 20th century. It may sound counter-intuitive, but we can kill our market order by undermining the IRS.

Circling back, the administration is oriented to using both monetary and fiscal policy (taxing and spending) to support equitable development, augment financial stability, as well as tackle problems like inflation. His recent nominations to the Fed’s Board (Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson, and Sarah Bloom Raskin [’86]) suggest that he’s interested in a diverse staff contributing to the policy mix.

The administration has also taken some steps to address the racial wealth gap and race-based disparities. It re-started the state small business credit initiative (SSBCI) with a set-aside for socially and economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs and tribal communities, as well as priority for micro-businesses which are often owned by people of color. The program works by using federal capital to leverage private funds at up to 10:1, multiplying the bang for the federal buck.

The administration is oriented to using both monetary and fiscal policy (taxing and spending) to support equitable development, augment financial stability, as well as tackle problems like inflation.

The program brings us back to the impact of the current banking network because it depends on states having community bank and community development finance institutions (CDFIs) that can reach small entrepreneurs inclusively. The administration has moved to strengthen those institutions with another program that infuses capital into CDFIs and minority-owned banks. There’s also a good provision in the infrastructure bill to reconnect neighborhoods, often communities of color, separated by old highway projects. On the other hand, these measures are just a start; we need much more progress elsewhere, for example on revising the Community Reinvestment Act.

HLT: What has it gotten wrong?

Desan: On the subject of existential crises, we are perennially behind the ball on climate change, a matter that itself disproportionately affects underserved and minority communities with flooding, land loss, and heat-related dangers. A recent study found that federal, state, and local governments contributed only ten percent of U.S. climate finance. There are some promising developments here, including the administration’s movement to assess the damage caused by greenhouse gases more accurately, a reform that could increase returns on green infrastructure projects. But the scale of the problem we face requires action that is far bolder. A student of mine recently suggested federal innovation modeled on the National Housing Act of 1934 or the Farm Loan Act of 1916, legislation that used federal authority to create markets for mortgages that reduced the risks for investors in those sectors and could be used analogously to create markets for green bonds. There are at least four bills in Congress proposing federal green banks that would great expand funding, including loans, guarantees, and equity financing. It’s unclear, however, how that funding might be conditioned and how far it would extend. And as we all know, in a Congress so closely divided, the power of the fossil fuel industry has stymied essential movement.

Moving from the profound to the prosaic level, the administration also has to move forward on its appointments — it’s the people on the ground who make the monetary and banking system operate, including at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The most vigorous appointees so far at work are not in the bank regulatory realm but at the SEC (Gary Gensler) and the CFBP (Rohit Chopra), and the FTC (Lina Khan), while the OCC lost a tremendously talented and creative candidate in Saule Omarova, widely lauded by her peers in the fin reg world. But I’d now qualify this with the news of Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination; she would bring great insight to the supervisory post on the Board, while balancing out Biden’s more conservative decision to stick with Jerome Powell as chair.

HLT: What has the administration not addressed yet that it should?

Desan: In 2021, some $15 trillion worth of crypto assets changed hands, according to a recent article in the Financial Times. That included a 79% rise in the amount of theft, ransomware, and illicit activity. Market activity in the area expanded so substantially, however, that total criminal activity actually fell as a proportion. Fascinating, but not, to my mind, a sign that the area is working well. Both the absolute amount of scamming and the sheer dimension of market activity in the area flag it as an area that carries great risks. That’s true for individual investors given the volatility and opacity in crypto assets. And it’s true for us as a society for a host of reasons. The President’s Working Group issued a report in November that identified stable coins as posing a number of systemic dangers. Stable coins, which are generally used to facilitate exchange in other digital assets, promise 1:1 convertibility into sovereign currencies. Imagine, however, a run on those currencies if people began to doubt the value of the assets that backed them. That’s the kind of danger that we work hard to prevent in the banking sector, and need to confront in the crypto area. The Biden administration has now to make a whole set of decisions about how responsibility will be parceled out between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation, and the FDIC, which would oversee stable coins if they were issued by depository institutions.

We are perennially behind the ball on climate change, a matter that itself disproportionately affects underserved and minority communities with flooding, land loss, and heat-related dangers.

Lastly, I’d argue that the Biden administration should think in more visionary terms about our monetary infrastructure. Finance has channeled its benefits upwards; recent studies suggest that the industry is claiming significantly higher profits without increased efficiency. At the same time, the financial architecture has required great infusions of cash from the public twice within the last two decades — once when it broke of its own weight in 2008 and next when it struggled to digest an external shock that came with COVID-19. There are some powerful reform ideas out there that aim at both the inequitable aspects of the system and its structural vulnerability to instability.

“FedAccounts” would offer individuals a public option for banking: digital accounts at the central bank would create access to banking services for Americans, about a third of our population, who are unbanked or underbanked; reduce their need for predatory services; and stabilize the banking system by reducing its role in money creation. Postal banking could dovetail with that idea, delivering services at the locations that are as familiar, trusted, and widely diffused as the post office. The Biden administration should also support initiatives that establish state and municipal public banks. Those entities can diversify the credit allocation and recycle the profits of public revenue into local communities.

There’s a theme here: we should be looking at ways to innovate towards monetary and financial structures that have democratic legitimacy, that are inclusive, and that return benefits widely to the communities that support them."

Smacking his pen on his White House desk, a satisfied Biden exclaimed “Got it!” before rising to leave the room.

Though some experts — even in his own party — warned that the new spending could cause the economy to overheat, administration officials saw little reason for concern. Just one day earlier, the Labor Department had put annual inflation at a tame 1.7 percent.

Yet even as the president beamed, forces were stirring that would put the rescue plan at the center of a debate over whether he had blundered with his free-spending recipe for recovery, souring Americans on his stewardship of the economy and allowing Republicans to capitalize on the rising cost of living.

The political and economic consequences of Biden’s first landmark law will be debated for years. But 18 months later, there is a consensus that the rescue plan was a double-edged sword: Bathing the economy in cash spurred the fastest recovery of any Group of 7 nation, even as the indiscriminate nature of that spending helped ignite the biggest jump in consumer prices in 40 years.

While experts disagree about the extent of the rescue plan’s contribution to inflation, it seems clear that its role has been larger than the Biden administration concedes while falling short of the calamity that Republicans claim.

Within days of the March 2021 White House event, as the plan’s $1,400 stimulus checks landed in Americans’ bank accounts, prices for items such as used cars and airline and sports tickets began to rise. Today, annual inflation stands at 8.3 percent, near its highest mark in 40 years.

Even without the rescue plan, the United States would have experienced significant inflation because of the unprecedented dislocation brought on by the coronavirus. As economies around the world last year eased their pandemic restrictions, a surge of consumer spending collided with chronic supply problems to boost prices almost everywhere. Outbreaks of coronavirus variants and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further aggravated tight markets.

But many economists have concluded that the rescue plan made U.S. inflation worse.



The Covid Money Trail

It was the largest burst of emergency spending in U.S. history: Two years, six laws and more than $5 trillion intended to break the deadly grip of the coronavirus pandemic. The money spared the U.S. economy from ruin and put vaccines into millions of arms, but it also invited unprecedented levels of fraud, abuse and opportunism.



In a yearlong investigation, The Washington Post is following the covid money trail to figure out what happened to all that cash.

The money spared the U.S. economy from ruin and put vaccines into millions of arms, but it also invited unprecedented levels of fraud, abuse and opportunism.In a yearlong investigation, The Washington Post is following the covid money trail to figure out what happened to all that cash. The highest estimate — that roughly half or about four percentage points of the recent increase in annual inflation can be attributed to the rescue plan — comes from Francesco Bianchi of Johns Hopkins University, who presented findings from a paper he co-authored at the Federal Reserve’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Four economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in March, after comparing the U.S. experience to that of other advanced economies, said the combined effects of all fiscal measures in 2020 and 2021 had pushed inflation higher, with the effect peaking late last year after the rescue plan took hold at about three percentage points. And Laurence Ball of Johns Hopkins, along with Daniel Leigh and Prachi Mishra of the International Monetary Fund, arrived at a similar figure for the rescue plan alone in a paper presented at a Brookings Institution conference in early September. “We certainly could have had a world in which we had protected the economy and generated far less inflation,” said Lawrence Summers, a critic of the rescue plan who was President Barack Obama’s top economic adviser. “The likely consequence of the inflation we have run — in addition to substantial reductions in the real wages of workers — is going to be to bring on the next recession sooner than we otherwise would have had it.” The Biden administration disputes these assessments, noting that some studies have found smaller effects. An October 2021 analysis by other economists at the San Francisco Fed, for example, which relied on a labor market measure of economic slack, concluded that the rescue plan was responsible for just 0.3 percentage points of added inflation. The administration has conducted no formal assessment of the plan’s link to inflation. But officials note that the U.S. experience is not unique. Inflation in August was 9.9 percent in the United Kingdom; 9.1 percent in the euro zone; and 7.0 percent in Canada. In an interview, Gene Sperling, the plan’s White House coordinator, insisted that the legislation’s benefits outweighed its costs. “The American Rescue Plan came at a time when the recovery was still uncertain, Sperling said. “The unexpected hits from delta, omicron, Chinese lockdowns and an unthinkable war in Ukraine that has roiled global energy markets each or together could have derailed this recovery long ago without the cushion provided by more sustained recovery funding.”

Indeed, in the 18 months since the rescue plan was signed into law, the economic landscape has been transformed. More than 8 million Americans who were jobless in March 2021 are now working. The economy last year posted its fastest growth since 1984 and ended the year more than 3 percent larger than before the pandemic.

Determining the plan’s precise contribution to inflation is difficult. About $900 billion in plan spending occurred last year, hitting the economy like a shot of espresso. But the $25 trillion U.S. economy also was shaped by ultraloose Fed monetary policies, including interest rates near zero and trillions of dollars in asset purchases that further eased credit.

The result was an episode of sticker shock that was utterly unfamiliar for most Americans. Each month, it seemed, inflation spread into another corner of everyday life. In May, it was fuel oil. June, gasoline. July saw hot dogs and women’s dresses grow more expensive.

By the end of the year, just about everything cost more: men’s shirts and sweaters; bread and crackers; dishes, jewelry and rent.

Economists have struggled to untangle the forces that drove the inflation outbreak. The studies conducted to date employ various methodologies and make assumptions about how the economy works, which in some cases have been criticized as unrealistic.

Summers’s conclusion that the Biden plan was excessive rests on a Congressional Budget Office assessment of economic slack known as the “output gap.” But such estimates are notoriously imprecise, and Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs said at the time that the CBO’s estimate was much too low, suggesting that the economy could absorb more federal spending than Summers thought.

Likewise, the conclusion by Bianchi and co-author Leonard Melosi of the Chicago Fed that the rescue plan accounts for roughly half of the added inflation assumed that Americans have lost confidence in the government’s willingness to repay the debt incurred during the pandemic and thus anticipate that inflation will stay high.

But so far, there is no sign of that concern. Bond investors expect prices to rise at an average annual rate of less than 2.5 percent over the next decade, according to one financial market gauge.

Some economists agree with the White House that the jobs and growth gained more than offset any effect on prices. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, said the rescue plan initially had provided some “good inflation” after years in which the Fed struggled to get the economy moving fast enough to reach its 2 percent target for price stability.

Subsequent “bad inflation” came from coronavirus-related disruptions and commodity price shocks associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Zandi added.

Yet a pair of recent studies from the San Francisco Fed suggest a bigger role for the rescue plan. Inflation in the United States raced ahead of price measures in other advanced economies in early 2021 as rescue plan funds began flowing, according to a March study by economists Oscar Jorda, Celeste Liu, Fernanda Nechio and Fabian Rivera-Reyes, which said higher government spending lifted inflation rates by three percentage points.

Unusually high demand for goods and services played a large role in driving prices higher starting in March as the rescue plan cash began to be distributed, according to Adam Shapiro, another economist with the San Francisco Fed.

“The surge in inflation in March 2021 was mainly due to the increase in demand-driven factors. During this period the economy began to reopen from pandemic-related public health policies, and the American Rescue Plan enacted in March 2021 further stimulated demand factors,” Shapiro concluded in a June study.

******************

From the start of the pandemic, the United States responded with overwhelming financial firepower. Congress approved the $2.2 trillion Cares Act before the end of March 2020, as the economy was shutting down and millions of Americans were losing their jobs.

During the presidential campaign, as the economy struggled to heal, Biden aides discussed with the former vice president the need to generate economic stimulus plans alongside his signature Build Back Better investment program, according to a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Several key members of the Biden team — including the then-candidate — had served in the Obama administration, which was criticized following the 2008 financial crisis for presiding over the weakest economic recovery in the postwar era.

Despite the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, Obama in 2009 kept his stimulus request below $1 trillion. By 2010, he was discussing potential cuts in government spending under pressure from congressional Republicans, even as the jobless rate hovered near 10 percent.

Ultimately, it took more than six years for the United States to recover the jobs that had been lost in the recession.

Along with Biden himself, Obama administration veterans Cecilia Rouse and Jared Bernstein of the Council of Economic Advisers; Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council; and Sperling concluded that it would be better to overshoot on economic repairs than undershoot.

Along with the third round of stimulus checks, the rescue plan funded an additional $300 weekly unemployment benefit, an expanded child tax credit and aid to state and local governments.

“When you are coming out of a deep recession, you need to have an insurance policy against unexpected economic hits, because if you get stuck before you get all the way back, the pain can be long term and scarring for millions and millions of workers,” Sperling said. “That is what happened after the Great Recession. Having a stronger and longer-lasting rescue plan was an important lesson learned.”

*********************

Eighty days before Biden signed the rescue plan into law, Congress in December 2020 approved a $900 billion coronavirus relief measure, which included $600 stimulus checks, rental assistance, help for small businesses and funding for vaccines and testing.

Democrats, who had pushed for a larger package, vowed to pass additional relief after Biden’s inauguration.

On Jan. 5, Democratic candidates in Georgia won both U.S. Senate seats — and control of the chamber — in runoff elections after promising another round of stimulus checks.

Three days later, while the country was still reeling from the attack on the U.S. Capitol, a government report showed that the economy had lost 140,000 jobs in December. Without more government funding, the jobless rate would be weaker than pre-pandemic forecasts until 2024, leaving millions without work for years, the White House warned.

More than 3,300 Americans were dying each day as the omicron variant spread across the country, leaving the nation unsettled about the days ahead.

These signs of fresh economic weakness cemented the political imperative to spend more on coronavirus relief.

Still, voices on both sides of the aisle urged restraint. Summers, a Democrat and former treasury secretary, published an op-ed in The Washington Post complaining that the president’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus was three times what was needed to fill the hole in the economy.

That same day, Michael Strain, a former Fed economist now with the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, made a similar case in congressional testimony, zeroing in on plans for new stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment payments and aid to state and local governments.

All were too big, he said, adding that a $750 billion alternative would be more appropriate.

*****************

Americans received stimulus payments worth more than $242 billion in the first six days after Biden signed the rescue plan into law, a tremendous infusion of cash. Billions of dollars more went out at weekly intervals over the next month.

Though it wasn’t clear at the time, the checks landed on an economy that was already growing at an annual rate of more than 6 percent.

The first burst of rescue plan payments coincided with a surge in spending on new and used cars, according to Commerce Department data. Many new car models were in short supply because of a shortage of computer chips. Many consumers who might have preferred a new car ended up buying a used one.

Consumers flush with rescue plan cash encountered a market that was millions of cars short. Prices for used cars rose in April by 10 percent, the largest one-month gain since the government began keeping track in 1953, and then jumped by an additional 8 percent in May.

Rescue plan money wasn’t the only factor driving sales. Consumers also had received delayed tax refunds and were drawn to car lots by good weather and sales incentives. Many who had delayed purchases during the first year of the pandemic finally felt free to shop as vaccines became more widely available.

“The increase that we’re seeing is beyond the stimulus,” Bill Nash, chief executive for CarMax, told investors in April 2021.

Other retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, said stimulus checks had helped their sales, too.

In many corners of the economy, employment rose alongside prices.

Used cars and trucks cost 37 percent more at the end of 2021 than they had at the beginning of the year. Yet even as shoppers grumbled, job seekers celebrated. Used vehicle retailer Carvana doubled its workforce to 21,000 people over the course of the year, according to securities filings.

Still, White House officials were sensitive to criticism that the stimulus payments were not targeted to those with the greatest need. Married couples with incomes up to $150,000 — or individuals making $75,000 — were generally eligible for the full $1,400 benefit.

More than $94 billion was paid to Americans with household incomes above the national median, according to Treasury Department statistics.

“It could have been distributed a little better,” said Lisa Franzese, 54, a payment accounts coordinator in Lakeland, Fla., who said she remained employed throughout the pandemic. “I understand they didn’t have time to drill down to determine who needed it most. But not everybody needed it. It could have been held back from people like me and given to people who had more dire needs.”

Yet at the time, most economists saw little risk. In June 2021, when the University of Chicago Booth School of Business surveyed economists, just 26 percent agreed that U.S. spending and monetary policies posed “a serious risk of prolonged higher inflation.”

**************

Republicans over the past year have pointed to Biden’s coronavirus spending as a principal source of the worst inflation since the Carter administration.

As inflation topped 9 percent in June, GOP prospects for grabbing the reins of Congress rested on attacking the president for losing control of consumer prices. That big number, though, was pushed by a surge in energy prices related to the war in Ukraine.

Erica Miller, 26, an attorney in Lincoln County, N.C., said the rescue plan “absolutely” helped fuel inflation.

“I don’t think it was the best call,” she said. “They say we’ve recovered from the recession quicker, but I’m not sure. In the small town I live in, they’re still hurting for workers. Everybody’s very frustrated. Lots of businesses need workers, but nobody wants to work.”

In July, 32 percent of those surveyed by the Pew Research Center said that government spending to address the economic impact of the coronavirus had contributed “a lot” to inflation and 38 percent said it had added “some” to rising prices.

But larger numbers blamed corporate profiteering, supply chain woes and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Miller said she recognizes that inflation was a “perfect terrible storm” made up of many factors.

Any assessment of the rescue plan’s inflationary fallout must recognize the program’s labor market dividends. In August, total employment for the first time exceeded its pre-pandemic peak, marking a 30-month rebound that was more than twice as fast as the recovery after the Great Recession in 2008.

Speaking in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in September, the president hailed signs of continued jobs growth and called them evidence that his plan was working."

Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, and our First Lady and Second Gentleman, members of Congress and the Cabinet, Justices of the Supreme Court, my fellow Americans: Last year, COVID-19 kept us apart. This year, we’re finally together again.

Tonight — tonight we meet as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, but, most importantly, as Americans with a duty to one another, to America, to the American people, and to the Constitution, and an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.

Six — thank you. Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people. Ukraine

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination literally inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees, to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

And in this struggle — President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament, “Light will win over darkness.”

The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight sitting with the First Lady. Let each of us, if you’re able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world and Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

She’s bright, she’s strong, and she’s resolved.

Yes. We, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history, we’ve learned this lesson: When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos; they keep moving; and the costs, the threats to the America — and America, to the world keeps rising.

That’s why the NATO Alliance was created: to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War Two.

The United States is a member, along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber, in this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well.

But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united. And that’s what we did: We stayed united.

We prepared extensively and carefully. We spent months building coalitions of other freedom-loving nations in Europe and the Americas to — from America to the Asian and African continents to confront Putin.

Like many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European Allies.

We shared with the world, in advance, what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely and justify his aggression.

We countered Russia’s lies with the truth. And now — now that he’s acted, the free world is holding him accountable, along with 27 members of the European Union — including France, Germany, Italy — as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others. Even Switzerland are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine.

Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.

Together. Together. Together, along with our Allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We’re cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system; preventing Russia’s Central Bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 billion war fund worthless. We’re choking Russia’s access, we’re choking Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who’ve bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: No more.

The United States — I mean it. The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs. We’re joining with European Allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains. Russian Oligarchs

And, tonight, I’m announcing that we will join our Allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy.

He has no idea what’s coming.

The ruble has already lost 30 percent of its value, the Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended.

The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is the one to blame.

Together with our Allies, we’re providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom: military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We’re giving more than a billion dollars in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we’ll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering. Aid to Ukraine

But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.

For that purpose, we have mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries, including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

And as I’ve made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power — every single inch.

And we’re clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks, and months will be hard on them.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

And a pound of Ukrainian people — the proud, proud people — pound for pound, ready to fight with every inch of (inaudible) they have. They’ve known 30 years of independence — have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

To all Americans, I’ll be honest with you, as I’ve always promised I would be. A Russian dictator infa- — invading a foreign country has costs around the world. And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy and that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels of our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, united with our Allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. But I know news about what’s happening can seem alarming to all Americans. But I want you to know: We’re going to be okay. We’re going to be okay.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. Putin's War

While it shouldn’t and while it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.

We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West.

We see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is the real test, and it’s going to take time. So, let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations: We stand with you. We stand with you.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he’ll never gain the hearts and souls of Ukrainian people. He’ll never — he’ll never extinguish their love of freedom. And he will never, never weaken the resolve of the free world.

We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.

I understand, like many of you did. My dad had to leave his home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So, like many of you, I grew up in a family when the price of food went up, it was felt throughout the family; it had an impact.

That’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan, because people were hurting. We needed to act and we did. American Rescue Plan https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/?utm_source=link&share_id=QaC8CO Share This

Few pieces of legislation have done more at a critical moment in our history to lift us out of a crisis. It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief to tens of millions of Americans. It helped put food on the table. Remember those long lines of cars waiting for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk? It cut the cost of healthcare insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave the people “just a little bit of breathing room.”

And unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1 percent of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people and left no one behind. And, folks — and it worked. It worked.

It worked and created jobs — lots of jobs. In fact, our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in one year than ever before in the history of the United States of America. Economic Progress Report https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/?utm_source=link&share_id=1dCWCX Share This

The economy grew at a rate of 5.7 last year — the strongest growth rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing fundamental change to our economy that hasn’t worked for working people in this nation for too long.

For the past 40 years, we were told that tax breaks for those at the top and benefits would trickle down and everyone would — would benefit.

But that trickle-down theory led to a weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and a widening gap between the top and everyone else in the — in nearly a century.

Look, Vice President Harris and I ran for office — and I realize we have fundamental disagreements on this — but ran for office with a new economic vision for America: invest in America; educate Americans; grow the workforce; build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know when the middle class grows — when the middle class grows, the poor go way up and the wealthy do very well.

America used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. And now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st century if we don’t fix it.

That’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And I thank my Republican friends who joined to invest and rebuild America — the single biggest investment in history. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Learn More

It was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We’re now talking about an infrastructure decade.

And look, it’s going to — it’s going to transform America to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century that we face with the rest of the world, particularly China.

I’ve told Xi Jinping: It’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people.

We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans — modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways — all across America. And we’ll do it to withstand the devastating effects of climate crisis and promote environmental justice.

We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations; begin to replace the poisonous lead pipes, so every child, every American has clean water to drink at home and at school.

We’re going to provide — provide affordable high-speed Internet for every American — rural, suburban, urban, and Tribal communities. Four thousand projects have already been announced. Many of you have announced them in your districts.

And tonight, I’m announcing that, this year, we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. Highways https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/?utm_source=link&share_id=0KCPC9 Share This

And, folks, when we use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America, we’re going to do it by buying American. Buy American products. Support American jobs.

The federal government spends about $600 billion a year to keep this country safe and secure. There’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every administration — Democrat and Republican — says they’ll do it, but we’re actually doing it.

We’ll buy America to make sure every — everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of it.

But, folks, to compete for the jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. That’s why it’s so important to pass the bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. Bipartisan Innovation Act

We used to invest almost 2 percent of our GDP in research and development. We don’t now. Can’t — China is.

Let me give you one example why it’s so important to pass.

If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find a thousand empty acres of land. It won’t look like much. But if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “field of dreams” — the ground on which America’s future will be built.

That’s where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor “mega site.” Up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. Ten thousand new jobs. And in those factories, the average job — about $135 — $135,000 a year.

Some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and everyday lives, from smartphones, technology that — the Internet — technology that’s yet to be invented.

But that’s just the beginning.

Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight — and I don’t know where Pat is. Pat? There you go, Pat. Stand up. Pat came to see me, and he told me they’re ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion.

That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.

So, let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk, I’ll sign it, and we will really take off in a big way.

And, folks, Intel is not alone. There’s something happening in America. Just look around, and you’ll see an amazing story — the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products “Made in America,” the revitalization of American manufacturing.

Companies are choosing to build new factories here when just a few years ago, they would have gone overseas. That’s what is happening.

Ford is investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.

GM is making the largest investment in its history — $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.

All told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in America last year alone.

Folks, powered by people I’ve met — like JoJo Burgess from generations of union steelworkers in Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. Where are you, JoJo? There you go. Thanks, buddy.

As Ohio — as Ohio Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label ‘Rust Belt.'” It’s time to see the — the — what used to be called the Rust Belt become the — the home of a significant resurgence of manufacturing.

And with all the bright spots in our economy — record job growth, higher wages — too many families are struggling to keep up with their bills.

Inflation is robbing them of gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel. I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. Inflation

I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.

Look, our economy roared back faster than almost anyone predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough people because of the pandemic to keep up production in their factories. So, you didn’t have people making those beams that went into buildings because they were out — the factory was closed.

The pandemic also disrupted the global supply chain. Factories close. When that happens, it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores, and go — prices go up.

Look at cars last year. One third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales. There weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.

And guess what? Prices of automobiles went way up, especially used vehicles as well.

And so, we have a choice.

One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.

I think I have a better idea to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages.

And, folks, that means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America, more goods moving faster and cheaper in America, more jobs where you can earn a good living in America.

Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. Look, economists call this increasing the productive capacity of our economy. I call it building a better America. Building a Better America

My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. Seventeen Nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and, I believe, most Americans support the plan.

And here’s the plan.

First, cut the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world.

Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy — the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis. He and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day.

Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That’s what it costs the — the pharmaceutical company. But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times that amount.

I spoke with Joshua’s mom. Imagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God’s name you’re going to be able to pay for it — what it does to your family, but what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it. Think about that. That’s what I think about.

You know, yesterday — Joshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.

For Joshua and 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it. And drug companies will do very, very well — their profit margin. Cost of Insulin

And while we’re at it — I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this — let’s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs.

Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans to save them $2,400 a year on their health premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.

And second, let’s cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change. Let’s provide an investment and tax credit to weatherize your home and your business to be energy efficient and get a tax credit for it; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving another $80 a month that you’ve not going to have to pay at the pump. Energy Efficiency

Folks — third — the third thing we can do to change the standard of living for hardworking folks is cut the cost of childcare. Cut the cost of childcare.

Folks, if you live in a major city in America, you can pay up to $14,000 a year for childcare per child.

I was a single dad for five years, raising two kids. I had a lot of help, though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother, and sister that really helped.

But middle-class and working folks shouldn’t have to pay more than 7 percent of their income to care for their young children.

My plan would cut the cost of childcare in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford childcare to be able to get back to work, generating economic growth. Cost of Child Care

But my plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care, more affordable housing, pre-K for three- and four-year-olds. All of these will lower costs to families.

And under my plan, nobody — let me say this again — nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Not a single penny.

I may be wrong, but my guess is, if we took a secret ballot in this floor, that we’d all agree that the present tax system ain’t fair. We have to fix it.

I’m not looking to punish anybody, but let’s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share.

Look, last year — like Chris Coons and Tom Carper and my distinguished congresswoman — we come from the land of corporate America. There are more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other state in America combined. And I still won 36 years in a row. The point is: Even they understand they should pay just a fair share.

Last year, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes.

No, look, it’s not fair. That’s why I proposed a 15 percent minimum tax rate for corporations.

We’ve got — and that’s why in the G7 and other meetings overseas we were able to put together — I was able to be somewhat helpful — 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate — so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. It’ll raise billions of dollars.

And that’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes for the very wealthy who don’t pay — who pay a lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter.

So that’s my plan. But we have — we’ll go into more detail later.

I’m going to grow — we will grow the economy, lower the costs to families.

So, what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. We all know we’ve got to make changes.

Folks, and while you’re at it, confirm my nominees for the Federal Reserve which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.

My plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.

The previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs — the job of those to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. Remember we had those debates about whether or not those watchdogs should be able to see, every day, how much money was being spent, where it — was it going to the right place? In my administration, the watchdogs are back. And we’re going after the criminals who stole billions of relief money meant for small business and millions of Americans. Pandemic Fraud

And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.

And, look I think we all agree — thank you — by the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office — the only President ever to cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion in a single year.

Lowering your costs also meant demanding more competition. I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation. It drives up prices.

When corporations have to compete, their profits go up and your prices go up — when they don’t have to compete.

Small businesses and family farmers and ranchers — I need not tell some of my Republican friends from those states — guess what? You got four basic meatpacking facilities. That’s it. You play with them or you don’t get to play at all. And you pay a hell of a lot more — a hell of a lot more because there’s only four.

See what’s happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, about half a dozen or less foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000 percent and made record profits.

Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on those companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.

Folks and as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch.

Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect, and they will look at that closely.

We’re also going to cut costs to keep the economy going strong and giving workers a fair shot; provide more training and apprenticeships; hire them based on skills, not just their degrees.

Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; and extend the Child Tax Credit so no one has to raise a family in poverty. Paycheck Fairness Act

Let’s increase Pell Grants; increase our historic support for HBCUs; and invest in what Jill, our First Lady, who teaches full-time, calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.

Look, let’s pass the PRO Act. When a majority of workers want to form a union, they shouldn’t be able to be stopped.

When we invest in our workers and we build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, together we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.

For more than two years, COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of this nation. And I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. That doesn’t even count the close to a million people who sit at a dining room table or a kitchen table and look at an empty chair because they lost somebody.

But I also know this: Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we’re moving forward safely, back to a norm- — more normal routines.

We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19 where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year.

Just a few days ago, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new mask guidelines. Under the new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now go mask free.

And based on projections — and based on projections, more of the country will reach a point across — that point across the next couple of weeks.

And thanks to the progress we’ve made in the past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives. I know some are talking about “living with COVID-19.” But tonight, I say that we never will just accept living with COVID-19; we’ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard. And here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely, in my view: COVID-19

First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted, you have the highest degree of protection, and we’ll never give up on vaccinating more Americans.

Now, I know parents with kids under five are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children. Scientists are working hard to get that done, and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do.

We’re already — we are also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90 percent.

I’ve ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. Pfizer is working overtime to get us a million pills this month and more than double that next month.

And now we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy and, if they prove positive, receive the antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.

And folks if you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.

We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward.

On testing, we’ve made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep.

And we’ve already ordered free tests. If you already ordered free tests, tonight I’m announcing you can order another group of tests. COVID — go to COVIDTests.gov, starting next week, and you can get more tests. Covid Tests https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/?utm_source=link&share_id=9dCDCR Share This

Second, we must prepare for new variants.

Over the past — we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of maybe months or years. And if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed.

I can’t promise a new variant won’t come, but I ca- — I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.

Third, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.

It’s time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people. People working from home can feel safe and begin to return to their offices.

We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.

Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.

With 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent, most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.

We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. Of course, continuing this costs money, so it will not surprise you I’ll be back to see you all. And re- — I’m going to soon send a request to Congress.

The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again — we may need them again. So I expect Congress — and I hope you’ll pass that quickly.

Fourth, we’ll continue vaccinating the world. We’ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries — more than any nation on Earth. We won’t stop, because you can’t build a wall high enough to keep out a —

A vaccine — the vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.

You know, we’ve lost so much in COVID-19. Time with one another. The worst of all, the much loss of life.

Let’s use this moment to reset. So, stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is: a God-awful disease. Let’s stop sending — seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we are: fellow Americans. Covid-19 Reset

Look we can’t change how divided we’ve been. That was a long time in coming. But we can change how to move forward on COVID-19 and other issues that we must face together.

I recently visited New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

They were responding to a 911 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.

Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22 years old. Both Dominican Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to patrol as police officers.

I spoke with their families, and I told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifices and we’ll carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety in every community it deserves.

Like some of you that have been around for a while — I’ve worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community policing — cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. Crime Prevention

Let’s not abandon our streets or choose between safety and equal justice. Let’s come together and protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.

That’s why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.

That’s why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police, invest in more proven strategies like community violence interruption, trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope.

We should all agree the answer is not to defund the police.

It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with the resources and training — resources and training they need to protect our communities.

I ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.

And we’ll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home — no serial numbers, can’t be traced.

I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon. Why? Why? And, folks, ban assault weapons with high-capacity magazines that hold up to 100 rounds. You think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests? Look, repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued — the only one. Imagine had we done that with the tobacco manufactures. These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment; they save lives. Gun Violence

The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote and have it counted. And look, it’s under assault.

In state after state, new laws have been passed not only to suppress the vote — we’ve been there before — but to subvert the entire election. We can’t let this happen.

Tonight, I call on the Senate to pass — pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Act — Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the DISCLOSE Act so Americans know who is funding our elections.

Look, tonight, I’d — I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Breyer — an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I mean it. Get up. Stand — let me see you. Thank you.

And we all know — no matter what your ideology, we all know one of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

As I did four days ago, I’ve nominated a Circuit Court of Appeals — Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds who will continue in just Brey- — Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender from a family of public-school educators and police officers — she’s a consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson Learn More

Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.

Folks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system.

And as you might guess, I think we can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling.

We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.

We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases — cases heard faster — and those who aren’t legitimately here can be sent back.

We’re screening — we’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.

We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led the generation of immigrants to this land — my forebearers and many of yours.

Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers — those with temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers. To revise our laws so businesses have workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.

It’s not only the right thing to do, it’s economically smart thing to do. That’s why the immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let’s get it done once and for all.

Folks, advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. The constitutional right affirmed by Roe v. Wade, standing precedent for half a century, is under attack as never before. If you want to go forward not backwards, we must protect access to healthcare; preserve a woman’s right to choose — and continue to advance maternal healthcare for all Americans. Roe v. Wade

And folks, for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families — it’s simply wrong.

As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I’ll always have your back as your President so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. Bipartisan Equality Act

Folks as I’ve just demonstrated, while it often appears we do not agree and that — we — we do agree on a lot more things than we acknowledge.

I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year, from preventing government shutdowns, to protecting Asian Americans from still-too-common hate crimes, to reforming military justice. And we’ll soon be strengthening the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago.

And it’s important — it’s important for us to show — to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.

So tonight, I’m offering a “Unity Agenda for the Nation”: four big things we can do together, in my view. Unity Agenda https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/?utm_source=link&share_id=neCgCR Share This

First, beat the opioid epidemic. There’s so much we can do: increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery; get rid of outdated rules and stop doctors and — that stop doctors from prescribing treatments; stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after the traffickers.

And if you’re suffering from addiction, you know — you should know you’re not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million — 23 million Americans in recovery.

Second, let’s take on mental health — especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.

The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning. I urge every parent to make sure your school — your school does just that. They have the money.

We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.

Children were also struggling before the pandemic: bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.

As Frances Haugen, who is here tonight with us, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. Folks — thank you. Thank you for the courage you showed. It’s time to strengthen privacy protections; ban targeted advertising to children; demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. Social Media Platforms https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/?utm_source=link&share_id=BvCzC6 Share This

And let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need — more people can turn for help and full parity between physical and mental healthcare if we treat it that way in our insurance.

Look, the third piece of that agenda is support our veterans. Veterans are the backbone and the spine of this country. They’re the best of us.

I’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip those we send to war and care for those and their family when they come home.

My administration is providing assistance and job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt free.

And our troops in Iraq have faced — and Afghanistan — have faced many dangers. One being stationed at bases, breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits. Many of you have been there. I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste — the wastes of war, medical and hazardous material, jet fuel, and so much more.

And they come home — many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors in the world — never the same: headaches, numbness, dizziness, a cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know.

One of those — one of those soldiers was my son, Major Beau Biden. I don’t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near — that his hooch was near in Iraq and, earlier than that, in Kosovo is the cause of his brain cancer and the disease of so many other troops. But I’m committed to find out everything we can.

Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio, the widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson. He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.

Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. And he loved building Legos with their daughter. But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.

Danielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. He didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.

Through her pain, she found purpose to demand that we do better. Tonight, Danielle, we are going to do better.

The VA — the VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to disease, already helping more veterans get benefits. And tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. Veterans

I’m also calling on Congress to pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and the comprehensive healthcare they deserve.

And fourth and last, let’s end cancer as we know it. This is personal. This is personal to me and to Jill and to Kamala and so many of you. So many of you have lost someone you love — husband, wife, son, daughter, mom, dad.

Cancer is the number-two cause of death in America, second only to heart disease.

Last month, I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. Cancer Moonshot

Our goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. And I think we can do better than that: turn cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases, more support for patients and families.

To get there, I call on Congress to fund what I called ARPA-H: Advanced — Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. Patterned after DARPA in the Defense Department, projects that led — in DARPA — to the Internet, GPS, and so much more that make our forces more safer and be able to wage war more — with more clarity.

ARPA-H will have a singular purpose to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes, and more.

A Unity Agenda for the nation. We can do these things. It’s within our power. And I don’t see a partisan edge to any one of those four things.

My fellow Americans — tonight we’ve gathered in a sacred space: the citadel of democracy. In this Capitol, generation after generation of Americans have debated great questions amid great strife and have done great things.

We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. We built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

Now is the hour: our moment of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience of history itself. It is in this moment that our character of this generation is formed, our purpose is found, our future is forged.

Well, I know this nation. We’ll meet the test, protect freedom and liberty, expand fairness and opportunity. And we will save democracy.

As hard as those times have been, I’m more optimistic about America today than I’ve been my whole life because I see the future that’s within our grasp, because I know there is simply nothing beyond our camas- — our capacity.

We’re the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we’ve faced into an opportunity, the only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.

So, on this night, on our 245th year as a nation, I’ve come to report on the state of the nation — the state of the union. And my report is this: The State of the Union is strong because you, the American people, are strong. We are stronger today — we are stronger today than we were a year ago. And we’ll be stronger a year from now than we are today. The State of the Union

This is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. And we will, as one people, one America — the United States of America.

God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Go get ’em."

It actually does.

Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, went too far in pinning blame for surging gasoline prices on Biden.

A look at the rhetoric and reality:

DEFICIT

BIDEN: “Last year, the deficit dropped for the first time since 2015. It fell by $360 billion last year and this year it’s on track to drop by more than $1 trillion after four years in a row of increasing deficits before I took office. We’re now on a track to see the largest-ever decline in a deficit in American history.” — remarks Tuesday.

THE FACTS: It’s not as big as it sounds.

While it’s true the deficit could end up falling by more than $1 trillion, the decline mostly reflects the improving economy as the pandemic has faded, not tax and spending decisions by the Biden White House or Congress. The government is no longer sending out stimulus checks and extra unemployment benefits as it did for the past two years. And tax revenue has increased as millions of Americans have found jobs and gotten pay raises. As a result, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that the federal government’s annual deficit will drop to $1.2 trillion this year, from $2.8 trillion in 2021 and a record $3 trillion in 2020.

Even with that drop, the deficit would still be at one of the highest levels in history.

Some of the decline is also due to a COVID-era policy change that basically deferred some tax collections. The government now is collecting far more payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, after allowing businesses to defer them during the pandemic.

In February, for example, the government’s tax receipts jumped 17%, while spending dropped 9% compared with a year ago. Spending on unemployment aid dropped $41 billion last month compared to February 2021, after an extra $300 in weekly unemployment benefits ended in September.

INFLATION

BIDEN, addressing political rhetoric on rising prices: “So, I’m sick of this stuff. We have to talk about it because the American people think the reason for inflation is the government is spending more money. Simply not true.” — remarks Friday at a House Democratic conference in Philadelphia.

REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: “Prices are surging, and Americans are footing the bill. No spring road trips because of #Bidenflation.” — tweet Tuesday.

THE FACTS: Biden sidesteps reality. Government spending has been a clear factor behind rising consumer prices, though it’s not the only one.

Biden last year signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package known as the American Rescue Plan — and many economists say that caused inflation to run higher than it otherwise would. There are multiple sources for inflation including global supply chain issues, the pandemic, stimulus from the Federal Reserve and, now, the Russian war in Ukraine.

But the problem is that Biden pumped more money into the economy than it could handle. Administration officials said before the relief package was passed that the greater risk was do too little to help the economy than to do too much. The implicit risk was inflation, though the tradeoff was faster hiring and stronger growth. Biden got all three: the hiring, the growth and the inflation.

Harvard University economists Jason Furman and Larry Summers – both officials in past Democratic administrations – warned of inflation rising because of the size of the relief package. Many conservative economists joined them, including Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute.

Republicans now are casting rising consumer prices as a direct and only result of “Bidenflation.” That’s incorrect. But Biden is wrong to say that government spending has had nothing to do with it.

GASOLINE PRICES

SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL: “Nobody buys Democrats’ efforts to blame 14 months of failed policies on three weeks of crisis in Europe. Inflation and gas prices were skyrocketing and hurting families long before late last month. The White House needs to stop trying to deny their mistakes and start fixing them.” — tweet Tuesday.

HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY: “Democrats want to blame surging prices on Russia. But the truth is, their out-of-touch policies are why we are here in the first place. Remember what happened on Day 1 with one-party rule? The president canceled the Keystone pipeline, and then he stopped new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters.” — March 8 remarks.

THE FACTS: The Republican leaders of Congress are overstating Biden’s ability to influence energy prices and the impact of the canceled Keystone pipeline.

Gasoline prices have been rising in tandem with oil prices since spring 2020 because demand has grown faster than worldwide production as economies try to shake off the pandemic. More people are driving and flying, and businesses are returning to pre-pandemic levels of activity, leading to more energy consumption, which pushes prices higher.

The price of oil is set on the world market. Even the leading producers – the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia – don’t get to set the price, although they might try by adjusting production up or down, a process that takes time even when it works. U.S. production dropped sharply in 2020, but it wasn’t because of anything that then-President Donald Trump did; it was because the pandemic crushed demand, causing producers to idle some of their wells rather than sell their oil too cheaply. U.S. oil production has doubled since 2011, but that didn’t stop oil from hitting and surpassing $100 a barrel.

U.S. oil production dipped about 1% from 2020 to 2021, not the dramatic drop portrayed by some of Biden’s critics. The nationwide average gasoline price is up about 80 cents from a month ago, and analysts attribute nearly all of that to the prospect of limiting Russia’s oil exports. McConnell and many other Republicans pushed to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil even before Biden acted.

The Keystone XL pipeline was designed to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada and North Dakota to refineries along the Gulf Coast. The United States consumed nearly 20 million barrels of oil a day last year, and global consumption was close to 100 million barrels, so the pipeline – which was far from completion when Biden revoked a permit – would have contributed less than 1% to the world supply of oil.

Asked whether the Keystone XL cancellation is the cause of high gas prices, Tom Kloza, analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, said: “A political talking point. Has nothing to do with 2022 price surge.”

Biden has announced decisions to release more oil from a strategic reserve, but those releases have been too small to have any effect on pump prices.

In the prime-time remarks, Biden plans to highlight the unity between the U.S. and its NATO allies in their response to Russia's ""premeditated and unprovoked"" invasion, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin underestimated the strength of the NATO alliance, according to prepared remarks released by the White House.

""Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson — when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,"" Biden plans to say. ""They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising.""

The remarks will come after another bloody day of fighting in Ukraine, where Russia hit major cities with increasingly heavy shelling as the conflict escalated on its sixth day. Meanwhile, a vast convoy of Russian forces threatened the capital, Kyiv.

On the domestic front, Biden also plans to focus heavily on the economy and inflation, which is at its highest levels in decades and has been cited by voters as a top concern. The president plans to outline ways his administration will lower costs for Americans, including by making more products in America and becoming less reliant on foreign supply chains.

""We have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation,"" Biden plans to say. ""Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains — let’s make it in America.""

Biden also plans to talk extensively about efforts he has taken to improve the U.S. economy and control the pandemic, while pressing Congress to revive his stalled domestic policy agenda.

He will tie that together under a theme of ""building a better America,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told House Democrats in a call Tuesday with Cedric Richmond, director of public engagement, according to two people who participated.

The speech comes at a pivotal moment for Biden, both at home and abroad. Among recent presidents, only his immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, came before Congress with a lower approval rating, with voters giving Biden low marks on everything from his leadership style to his handling of the economy.

The address may mark Biden’s last opportunity to make the case for his domestic policy agenda before a Congress controlled by his own party, with many Democrats facing a tough fight in the midterms.

Richmond told Democrats, “You can’t govern if you don’t win,” adding that the best way to keep power is to repeat Biden's message about how their accomplishments are improving the lives of Americans, according to the sources who participated in Tuesday's call.

The president’s team has been reworking his remarks in recent days to more heavily emphasize the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, in an interview with MSNBC this week, compared the moment to the remarks before Congress by President Barack Obama during the financial crisis or the one President George W. Bush gave after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, will attend the State of the Union address as a guest of first lady Jill Biden, seated in her viewing box, a senior administration official told NBC News.

But even as much of the world’s attention remains on Ukraine, administration officials said they are still hoping to use the moment to make the case for the work Biden has done on the economy and reassure Americans that the president has a plan to do more to address their economic concerns.

“The American people will hear a lot about how he’s going to lower their costs, how he’s going to continue to build a strong economy over the long term,” Psaki said.

While the majority of Americans say they disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy, the president plans to argue that his administration has helped the economy achieve its fastest job growth in American history and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years, a senior administration official said.

One of the top concerns cited by Americans in polls has been inflation, which is at its highest level in decades. Psaki said Biden will talk about lowering overall inflation along with reducing costs in specific areas like child care and prescription drugs with legislation he is pushing to get through Congress.

One specific step Biden plans to announce to help address rising prices will be an agreement between the Justice Department and the Federal Maritime Commission designed to make sure that large ocean freight companies can’t overcharge U.S. customers, the White House said.

Other new programs Biden is scheduled to announce include an effort to improve nursing home staffing, make poorly performing nursing homes accountable for improper and unsafe care, and improve publicly available information about nursing home conditions.

The president also plans to outline a plan to address the country's mental health crisis.

Biden will call for a large investment in the U.S. workforce to build capacity to meet mental health needs, a senior administration official said Tuesday. He'll call for an expansion of community mental health centers and investments in mental health resources in schools, the official continued.

The plan includes a call for action to address social media's harm to the mental health of young people, the official said, adding that the Department of Health and Human Services will launch a crisis hotline in the summer that would connect people to mental health resources.

Biden will also highlight his nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, including her deep qualifications and that she is a jurist in the mold of retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. Jackson is not going to attend the speech, the source said.

Biden intends to continue to press Congress to act on programs in his stalled Build Back Better legislation, specifically around lowering prescription drug costs and child care costs. He also plans to ask Congress to act on other ideas he has proposed, including better housing for older adults and disabled people, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and lowering the cost of higher education, including by way of an increase in the maximum Pell Grant award by more than $2,000.

When it comes to the pandemic, Biden will be addressing the country as it enters what public health officials hope will be a more manageable phase, where the virus can be controlled with vaccines, booster shots and new treatments.

He is expected to highlight new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week that said much of the country no longer needs to use masks in their daily lives, as well as the administration’s broader strategy for the pandemic.

Masks will be optional for members of Congress and others attending the speech Tuesday with the Capitol’s attending physician, Brian P. Monahan, pointing to decreasing Covid-19 case rates as well as the new CDC guidance.

Some members of Congress have tested positive for Covid — including Reps. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.; Jamie Raskin, D-Md.; and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., as well as Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif. — and won't attend the speech Tuesday night.

Covid case numbers have continued to decline across most of the country after surging earlier in the year."
235,Families Are Hurting From the Biden Administration's Economic Brain Freeze - Heritage.org,Families Are Hurting From the Biden Administration's Economic Brain Freeze  Heritage.org,"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhlcml0YWdlLm9yZy9tYXJrZXRzLWFuZC1maW5hbmNlL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvZmFtaWxpZXMtYXJlLWh1cnRpbmctdGhlLWJpZGVuLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9ucy1lY29ub21pYy1icmFpbi1mcmVlemXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Heritage.org,"The Biden administration seems willfully ignorant of how American families are hurting financially. The president himself, while munching on an ice-cream cone, pronounced the economy “strong as hell,” as if he could make it so by executive fiat. A plethora of data tell a very different story: the economy is melting faster than the president’s ice cream.

Immediately before Biden took office, the economy was growing at an annualized rate of $1.5 trillion and adding an average of 1.4 million jobs per month—an incredibly robust rate of growth. Inflation was almost non-existent—just 1.4%—and real wages were rising.

In less than two years, bungling throughout the federal government has sent the economy into a tailspin.

By printing trillions of dollars to fund equally large budget deficits, the government created an inflationary nightmare. Onerous regulations have simultaneously kept a choke collar around the neck of American producers, especially in the energy sector, while the expansion of welfare and removal of work requirements has decimated the labor market.

>>> Government Micromanagement Running Economy Into Ground

Eighteen months after taking office, Biden had driven inflation so high that prices were rising about as fast in a single month as they rose in the entire year before he became president. Wholesale inflation, which measures the rise in prices which businesses pay, has set 13 new record highs under Biden and has been in double digits for seven months, more than a third of his presidency.

Unlike inflation, job growth has slowed markedly under Biden, averaging less than half where it was during the recovery under Trump. And the $1.5 trillion annualized growth rate was thrown in reverse only a year into Biden’s term, with gross domestic product contracting in both the first and second quarters of this year. This recession should have come as no surprise with investment declining and consumer spending slowing to a crawl.

American families simply cannot afford to live in Biden’s America. Their real disposable incomes have fallen 11.7%, homeownership affordability is down 32%, monthly savings have collapsed 83.1% and credit card debt has ballooned 22.7%, all since Biden took office. Real earnings have also fallen 5.5%, meaning that the average family has lost over $6,000 in annual purchasing power. Adding insult to injury, so far in 2022, the average 401(k) has lost $34,000.

There simply are no data that in any way support the president’s claim of the economy being “strong as hell.” The economy more closely resembles a splattered scoop of ice cream fallen on the sidewalk than the cone Biden held while making that proclamation. Sadly, economic indicators are forecasting things will get worse for Americans’ finances.

>>> Failed Economic Policies Are Finally Catching Up With Politicians

Consumer spending is running on fumes as families deplete their savings and take on debt to try and sustain their standard of living. Similarly, businesses are only being sustained by a backlog of unfilled orders. Prices continue rising and energy prices in particular are poised to spike again this winter. In the coming months, the economic pain will intensify.

History will likely judge Biden harshly because he had the benefit of hindsight; his administration was able to look back at its immediate predecessor and see what worked and what did not. It has mysteriously chosen to ignore the successes, like increased American energy production, and double down on the failures, like paying unemployment “bonuses” which incentivized labor shortages.

In the end, the optics of brazenly ignoring mountains of economic data are quite indecorous. Those who make such assertions not only appear ignorant but also prideful. It takes much hubris to believe that you can convince the masses to ignore everything they see around them simply by your own royal decree."
236,Biden touts inflation reduction law despite sobering report - The Associated Press,Biden touts inflation reduction law despite sobering report  The Associated Press,"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2luZmxhdGlvbi1lY29ub215LXByaWNlcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWFuZC1wb2xpdGljcy04OTcwNmEwNGJjNzI3ZDNlNThhYjZiYjRiMmVmYTk5NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden gathered a crowd of thousands at the White House Tuesday to celebrate last month’s passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, even as a new government report showed how hard it could be to bring surging prices down near prepandemic levels.

Despite its name, the law’s impact on inflation is expected to be modest at best.

Tuesday’s economic report — inflation at 8.3% year-to-year, though just 0.1%. from July to August — was a harsh reminder of how difficult it might be to hit the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% a year. Even as gasoline prices have declined since June, the costs of housing and food remain especially high in a way that suggests further Fed rate hikes and more economic pain to bring down prices.

U.S. stock indices fell sharply on the inflation report, with the benchmark S&P 500 down more than 4.3% on Tuesday.

Still, Biden and congressional Democratic leaders hailed the new law, with the president raising his voice and taking off his jacket in campaign style at the event on the White House South Lawn.

“With this law the American people won and special interests lost,” Biden said, taking a victory lap for legislation that rounded out the last piece of his domestic agenda for his first two years in office.

The legislation, which passed with only Democratic votes in Congress, also included the most substantial federal investment in history to fight climate change — some $375 billion over a decade — and will cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 out-of-pocket annually for Medicare recipients. It also would help an estimated 13 million Americans pay for health care insurance by extending subsidies provided during the coronavirus pandemic. The measure is paid for by new taxes on large companies and stepped-up IRS enforcement on wealthy individuals and entities.

Biden in his remarks criticized Republicans for voting against the measure, contending they opposed a bill that would lower prices.

“I believe Republicans could have and should have joined us on this bill as well,” Biden said. “After all, this bill cut costs for families to help reduce inflation at the kitchen table.”

The law may help lower prescription drug prices, but outside analyses suggest it will do little to immediately bring down overall inflation. Last month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office judged it would have a “negligible” effect on prices through 2023. The University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model went even further to say “the impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero” over the next decade.

In theory, the law could reduce inflationary pressures because it would lower annual budget deficits by $300 billion over 10 years.

But by partially forgiving student debt and changing the repayment structure in an August executive order, Biden likely has wiped out those deficit savings, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. An analysis by the fiscal watchdog estimates that the president’s executive order on student debt would cost roughly $500 billion over 10 years, “completely eliminating any disinflationary benefit.”

Still, voters are especially sensitive to gasoline, which declined 10.6% in August. The Biden administration has repeatedly cited relief at the pump as gas costs have fallen since June —when average U.S. prices crested above $5 a gallon. AAA estimates that gas prices nationwide averaged $3.71 a gallon on Tuesday."
237,Biden's Misleading Claims About the Economic Recovery and Unemployment - FactCheck.org,Biden's Misleading Claims About the Economic Recovery and Unemployment  FactCheck.org,"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY3RjaGVjay5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOS9iaWRlbnMtbWlzbGVhZGluZy1jbGFpbXMtYWJvdXQtdGhlLWVjb25vbWljLXJlY292ZXJ5LWFuZC11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,FactCheck.org,"When President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law in March 2021, U.S. gross domestic product had increased for three quarters straight, and the unemployment rate had decreased nearly nine percentage points from its pandemic peak.

But at a fundraising reception on Sept. 13, Biden wrongly credited the Democratic COVID-19 relief bill enacted during the first months of his administration with rescuing a U.S. economy “in decline.” Economists told FactCheck.org that the weakened economy actually was “growing,” albeit at a “slower pace,” before the legislation became law.

Also, as of August, the unemployment rate was 3.7%, up 0.2 percentage points from 3.5% in July — which was the lowest it had been since February 2020, when it also was 3.5%.

However, in White House remarks the same day, Biden misleadingly claimed that the unemployment rate last month was “nearly a 50-year low in our country.”

The Recovery

Biden talked about the U.S. recovery from the COVID-19-caused economic collapse at a reception hosted by the Democratic National Committee. According to a White House transcript of his remarks, the president said: “I’ve stuck to what I said I was going to try to do from the American Rescue Plan, which we got passed without a single Republican vote in February, which literally turned the economy from one that was in decline to one that’s in recovery.”

The final version of the American Rescue Plan passed in the House and Senate in early March 2021, and Biden signed it into law on March 11. Only Democrats and independents voted in favor of the legislation, which included an estimated $1.8 trillion in additional spending to aid the nation’s economic recovery, such as $1,400 direct payments to eligible individuals.

The rescue plan, or ARP, followed two other major relief bills, the $1.7 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and about $900 billion for COVID-19 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act – both of which were enacted under former President Donald Trump in 2020. Those prior legislative efforts had already helped start the country’s economic comeback when Biden took office.

At the time the ARP became law, the economy certainly had not rebounded all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. It was still struggling, but the country’s fiscal status was improving, contrary to what Biden claimed.

For example, after two quarters of economic contraction at the start of the pandemic, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that real GDP grew by 33.8% in the third quarter of 2020, 4.5% in the fourth quarter and then 6.3% in the first quarter of 2021.

In addition, the unemployment rate, which reached a pandemic high of 14.7% in April 2020, was down to 6% in March 2021, after declining for nearly 10 months consecutively.

Several economists also told us the economy was not in decline.

“The economy, as measured by GDP or any other conventional metrics, was clearly growing from April 2020 at least till the end of 2021,” Johns Hopkins University economist Jonathan Wright said in an email. “At first this was at a fast pace, and then a slower pace. I do not agree with the statement that the economy was in decline at the time that the ARP was passed.”

Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, agreed.

“President Biden’s statement could be more carefully crafted,” he said in an email. “Taken literally, it is misleading. But I believe the broader implication is largely correct. The economy in early 2021 was growing, but from a very low level.”

“When the ARP was proposed, the economy had not yet recovered from the pandemic collapse,” Fazzari continued. “In the months following the ARP, GDP and job growth accelerated, speeding up the recovery.”

Wright also said that the “ARP boosted the economy,” which, in his words, “was operating at less than full potential at that time.”

The White House did not respond to our questions about Biden’s claim.

At times, the administration has highlighted a February analysis from Moody’s Analytics on global fiscal policy during the pandemic. That report projected that, if not for the ARP, the U.S. recovery would have taken longer, as the economy likely would have experienced a “double-digit recession” in the spring of 2021, leading to another increase in unemployment.

“The ARP is responsible for adding well over 4 million more jobs in 2021, and the economy is currently on track to recovering all the jobs lost in the pandemic by the second quarter of this year,” the report said. “If there had been no ARP, it would have taken another year for the economy to recover all of these jobs.”

The economy hit the point of recovering all lost jobs from the pandemic in the third quarter.

Still, Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi, one of the report’s authors, also told us in an email exchange that Biden’s claim at the DNC event was imprecise.

“I wouldn’t say the economy was in decline at the time the ARP was passed, but I would say the economy was fragile and that there was still substantial uncertainty regarding the path of the pandemic and the sustainability of the recovery,” Zandi wrote. “The ARP was important to insure that the recovery became a self-sustaining economic expansion.”

Unemployment

As for the unemployment rate, it was at 3.7% as of August, the most recent month for estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was up one-fifth of a percentage point from 3.5% in July.

In remarks from the White House South Lawn on Sept. 13, Biden made the misleading claim that the August rate was the lowest in almost five decades.

“Since we came to office, we’ve created nearly 10 million jobs — a record for any presidency up to this point — 3.7 percent unemployment, nearly a 50-year low in our country,” the president said. He has made similar claims about the rate before and since.

But the rate was as low as 3.5% in January and February of 2020 – just weeks before the spread of COVID-19 disrupted the global economy. The last time the rate was lower than that was when it was 3.4% for nine straight months between 1968 and 1969.

So the current rate is near a two-and-a-half-year low.

In addition, while the number of jobs added in Biden’s first 20 months — 9.7 million — is the most of any newly elected president, on a percentage basis, the growth in jobs under President Jimmy Carter was better than the increase so far under Biden.

Since Biden has been president, total nonfarm employment increased about 6.7% from roughly 143 million jobs in January 2021 to over 152.7 million in August 2022, according to the latest BLS figures. Under Carter, employment grew from about 80.7 million in January 1977 to almost 87.5 million in August 1978. That’s an employment increase of about 6.8 million workers, or 8.4%.

As we have written before, comparing the percentage increases — rather than raw jobs numbers — helps account for changes in the size of the labor force and the overall population over time.

Biden’s claim also doesn’t acknowledge the unique economic conditions created by COVID-19.

The U.S. economy lost nearly 22 million jobs at the start of the pandemic, when large parts of the economy shut down. By the time Biden took office, over 40% of those jobs still had not come back, BLS data show. So there was a lot of room for growth.

It was not until August that total nonfarm employment finally surpassed the pre-pandemic high of 152.5 million, according to the BLS’ preliminary figures.

Democrats voted to default on our debt, yet President Biden won’t address Republican concerns about the debt:

“I expect our debts to be paid and on time. This won’t be 2018 where Speaker Pelosi and Democrats voted to default on our debt. We will have an adult conversation about what is the trajectory of our deficits. Is there a way to both spur growth and put some common-sense guardrails around spending that would get us in a better place? That’s how I predict that will go. “I heard the claim about Republicans on Social Security and Medicare. I would point out that has been fact checked as false with four Pinocchios.”

Republicans’ Commitment to America means a stronger economy:

“Part of our Commitment to America is an economy that’s strong and what you’ll see House Republicans focus on less government spending, less taxes and regulation that fuel inflation under President Biden, more American-Made energy, more workers reconnected to their jobs, and more innovation and stronger supply chains that lower inflation. “You will see Republicans take the opposite tack of this president. We just saw new reports that the average pay cut for Americans because of Biden-Flation is the highest in 25 years. It’s a month’s worth of their salary. Today, they are digging into their savings, skipping meals, delaying retirement, their nest egg has also gone down by about a quarter so most Americans know Joe Biden’s economy is a very cruel one.”

Today’s new GDP report shows President Biden failed to meet expectations for six of seven quarters in his term:

“President Biden has missed expectations in six out of seven economic quarters he’s led, even though those numbers have been dumbed down over time. It’s because he drove inflation and this worker shortage so hard and, frankly, has no plan to get out of it at all. Unfortunately I think Americans will pay a very steep price for his economic failures.”

Excerpts and full video are below.

On Democrats’ Socialist Agenda:

“[Socialism] hasn’t worked in any country where it’s been tried. It has failed everywhere, so why we want to try it is beyond me.”

“[The Biden Administration believes] there are too many people making too much money and that all we need to do is take more of their money away from them, redistribute to people that have less, and somehow that’s good for the economy all the way around. Of course, that’s failed everywhere it’s been tried, but they’re trying it again.”

On President Trump’s Economy and Deregulation Efforts:

“In my mind, the thing Donald Trump had going for him in his 2016 election was he clearly understood that the federal government was the problem and he articulated that—the size of the deep state, the size of the bureaucracy. What he underestimated was just how strong that bureaucracy really is. So while he was reducing regulations through the rulemaking process, legislating, as well as guidance, people from the bureaucracy were working against him at every turn. Even at that he was able to accomplish a lot. What we saw was that private sector investment follows lower taxes, fewer regulations, and frankly, even a better environment that manifests itself just in attitude. And now you have exactly the opposite. This changes the investment mind and it changes the relationship with states. I wrote a 22-page essay for the Harvard [Journal of Law and Public Policy] that just came out in June. [It] talks about the heavy hand of the bureaucracy and… cooperative federalism. Donald Trump understood the value of states and state regulation and state oversight. That was a game changer in terms of unleashing ingenuity, innovation, and our economy.”

On Student Loan Forgiveness:

“This crazy idea of forgiving student loan debts at $10,000. Larry, if they took all of that money and just forced every student to take an Economics 101 class or supply-side economics class or study Milton Friedman or Art Laffer, we would do so much more for the economy than what [the Biden Administration is] trying to do. The problem is their constituency is that very government that they’re growing. They love that government, they love the power of it, they love the dependency of it, they love the organization of it, and that’s a fundamental difference between us and them.”

“I think everybody ought to buy Dick Armey’s memoirs and read that as well. You’d find out what works best. But we do have an economic illiteracy problem right in our own government. I mean, Jennifer Granholm the Secretary of Energy, every time she talks I swear to God there’s a professor somewhere in an economics department going ‘What did I do wrong?’ It’s unbelievable.”

On Government’s Role in the Marketplace:

“As I’ve said many times, if you give somebody a $7,500 Tesla tax credit, the price of a Tesla goes up $7,500. It’s basic [economics] 101. In fact, Ford just announced that they’re going to do exactly that, and why wouldn’t they? It’s the most natural incentive in the marketplace. This is why the government should stay out of the marketplace. What happens with all of these ideas is they compound. You end up having a tax credit for one thing, so what they’re competing against has to have a tax credit. You just pile tax credits on top of tax credits. This is why corporate America gets bigger and richer and the government gets bigger and poorer and the middle income wage earner is scratching [their] head going, ‘My paycheck is not going as far as it used to.’”"

President Joe Biden on Monday said the thirteen nations joining his long-sought economic plan for Asia were “signing up to work toward an economic vision that will deliver for all people on Earth.”

The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is Biden’s attempt at engaging a region coming increasingly under the influence of China. He unveiled it as he began the second leg of his debut tour of Asia. The announcement was one of the centerpieces of Biden’s visit to the continent, which began last week in South Korea and is continuing this week in Japan.

“We’re here today for one simple purpose: the future of the 21st Century economy is going to be largely written in the Indo-Pacific. Our region,” Biden said as he launched the plan.

“This framework should drive a race to the top,” he said.

Biden is walking a delicate balance in revealing the economic framework. While Asian nations have been clamoring for a way to partner with the United States to reduce dependance on China, the President is also facing protectionist sentiments at home, where economic pain in the form of higher prices has proved the central issue in November’s midterm elections.

Biden said Monday he did not believe a recession was inevitable, but acknowledged the pain was real.

“It’s bad,” he said, suggesting later that improvement could be a long time coming.

“This is going to be a haul. This is going to take some time,” he said, arguing things could have been much worse had he not taken steps like cultivating foreign investments in the US economy.

Before unveiling the plan, Biden called on Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and sat for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, discussing issues related to China, Taiwan and North Korea.

“The United States remains fully committed to Japanese, Japan’s defense, and we will face the challenges of today and the future together,” Biden said in his meeting with Kishida, their first formal face-to-face.

“The purpose of the visit is to increase our cooperation with other nations of the region and deliver concrete benefits to the people of the Indo-Pacfic region,” Biden said, going on to thank Kishida for joining a US-led effort to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Biden was welcomed to the Akasaka Palace with a stately ceremony that included the playing of national anthems and an inspection of ceremonial honor guards. Biden watched and placed his hand on his heart for the playing of the Star Spangled Banner.

China has loomed over each of Biden’s stops, a mostly unspoken but ever-present factor in his push to reorient American foreign policy to focus more on Asia. It became explicit on Monday when Biden, speaking on China’s doorstep in Tokyo, said the US would be willing to intervene militarily should China invade Taiwan. While acknowledging the US still agrees with the “One China” policy, Biden said that the idea of Taiwan being taken by force “is (just not) appropriate.” A White House official said later the US position on the “One China” policy had not changed.

When he meets Tuesday with leaders of a revitalized “Quad” grouping – the US, Japan, India and Australia – it will be with the tacit intention of countering Beijing’s attempts to expand its influence among its neighbors.

The economic framework comes with a similar goal. Ever since then-President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TTP) – the massive trade agreement negotiated during the Obama presidency – the US has been without a defined plan to engage this region economically.

Meanwhile, China has secured several trade agreements with its neighbors, and has sought to wield its economic influence globally through the Belt and Road Initiative.

The plan Biden will announce Monday isn’t a trade agreement in the traditional sense. It includes one “pillar” related to trade, but also incorporates other areas like making supply chains more resilient, promoting clean energy and combating corruption.

The nations participating in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) are Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, alongside the US.

The roster represents a relatively wide swath of Asia, from highly advanced economies like Japan and South Korea to countries that haven’t always aligned with the US on the economic front. But it doesn’t include Taiwan, which had been an open question as Biden was preparing a plan meant to create an economic sphere to counter China’s growing influence in the region.

By unveiling the framework, Biden appears to be acknowledging he has little intention of rejoining the TPP, which remains unpopular among US lawmakers who would need to ratify the deal. Instead, he hopes to generate an economic sphere that can compete with China.

“I think that the biggest problem with it was that we did not have the support at home to get it through,” US Trade Ambassador Katherine Tai said of the TPP, which was negotiated during the Obama presidency. “I think that there’s a very, very strong lesson there. That TPP as it was envisioned, ultimately, was something that was quite fragile, and that the United States was not able to deliver on and that informs very much our thinking about bringing the Indo-Pacific economic framework, as it’s designed here.”

It’s unclear whether IPEF will require Congressional approval; Tai said only “Let’s see where these negotiations take us” when asked if lawmakers would need to vote on the framework.

The Biden administration has worked hard to convince other countries to join – not only staunch partners like Japan and South Korea but smaller nations, particularly in Southeast Asia, who aren’t as closely aligned with the US.

The plan’s early detractors have suggested it lacks any incentives – like lowering tariffs – in return for joining up. Biden’s aides suggest there are other ways to facilitate more trade and market access, and that the framework itself provides an attractive opportunity for participating countries to work closely with the US. And if anything, Biden’s announcement Monday reflects just the beginning of the process for writing the plan.

Already, China has responded harshly to the framework, with a senior envoy calling it a “closed and exclusive clique.”

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden was traveling from South Korea to Japan, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the criticism was expected.

“It’s not a surprise to me that China has concerns about the number of countries, the diversity of countries who have expressed interest in and enthusiasm for IPEF,” he said. “It’s natural that they’re going to try to find ways to raise questions.”"

The US public’s view of the nation’s economy is the worst it’s been in a decade, a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS finds, with many Americans also saying they feel financial strain in their own lives.

That pessimism also reflects on President Joe Biden, whose ratings for handling the economy remain sharply negative. A majority of US adults say his policies have hurt the economy, and 8 in 10 say the government isn’t doing enough to combat inflation.

Only 23% rate economic conditions as even somewhat good, down from 37% in December and 54% last April. The last time public perception of the economy was this poor in CNN’s polling was November 2011, when 18% called economic conditions good.

Americans also say they are more likely to hear bad news than good news about the economy, by nearly a 4-to-1 margin: 89% say they’ve heard at least some bad news, compared with 23% who’ve heard at least some good news.

Americans remain generally dour about how things are going in the country overall, with just about one-third (32%) saying things in the country are going well, about the same as late last summer.

Although economic pessimism is most pronounced within the GOP, it spans party lines. A near universal 94% of Republicans rate current economic conditions in the US as poor, as do 81% of independents and 54% of Democrats. And across party lines, most Americans say they’ve heard little or no recent good news on the issue (88% among Republicans, 80% among independents, 61% among Democrats).

Biden gets low marks on the economy

The economy remains a notably weak spot for the President. Biden’s overall approval rating holds steady: 41% of Americans approve and 59% disapprove, effectively unchanged from CNN’s last poll, conducted in January and February. But his economic approval numbers continue to tick downward, with 34% now approving and 66% disapproving, compared with 37% approval and 62% disapproval earlier this year. Biden’s ratings have also continued to sink on the issue of helping the middle class (36% approve, down from 41% in February) and on immigration (34% approve, down from 40% last December).

Even within the Democratic Party, just 7 in 10 approve of Biden on the economy (71%) and helping the middle class (71%), considerably lower than the 86% of Democrats who approve of his performance overall. Fewer than half of Democrats say Biden has improved the nation’s economic standing (45%), down from 58% in December.

Overall, only 19% of Americans think Biden’s policies have improved economic conditions in the US, with 26% saying they’ve had no effect and 55% saying they’ve made conditions worse – a further devolution since December, when 45% said the President’s policies had made things worse.

By contrast, Biden’s ratings on handling the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while underwater – 46% approve, 54% disapprove – are better than his overall numbers. And a slim majority of 51% approves of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, up from a low of 45% amid the Omicron surge earlier this year.

The problem for Biden is that most Americans are much more likely to be concerned with the economy than Ukraine or Covid-19. Half of Americans call the economy the most important national issue (50%), up from 36% last November; the Russia-Ukraine war, the second-ranking issue, currently gets just 14%. One-tenth call immigration the top issue, while other subjects, including climate change, racial injustice and education, were all in the single digits. Only 5% call the Covid-19 pandemic the top issue, down from 20% last November. The poll was completed before Monday’s publication of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that affirmed the federal constitutional right to an abortion.

Americans are feeling economic strain

Americans are more positive about their own finances than they are about the economic situation nationally: 53% say they’re satisfied with their personal financial situation, down from 66% in 2016. Yet 41% say they’re worse off than they were a year ago, with just 23% saying their finances have improved in that time. Even among those who are satisfied with their current financial situation, only 35% say they’re better off now than they were a year ago.

With gas and food prices soaring, most Americans say economic conditions have led them to reduce nonessential spending (63%), change their grocery-buying habits (63%) and cut back significantly on driving (54%). A third say they’ve had difficulty finding affordable housing, rising to 42% among those in households making less than $50,000 annually, and 57% among those younger than 35.

Some of these hardships have become more widespread since last year. The share of Americans who say they’ve cut back on driving is up 11 points from December’s poll, with the share who say they’ve changed their grocery shopping habits rising 9 points, and the share who’ve had trouble finding affordable housing rising 7 points.

Those negative experiences run parallel to the largely pessimistic economic news Americans say they are hearing. Eighty-nine percent say they’ve heard a lot (50%) or some (39%) bad economic news lately, with just 11% saying they’ve heard not much (10%) or none at all (1%). By contrast, only 23% say they have heard even some recent good economic news, with half saying they haven’t heard much, and 27% that they’ve heard no good news at all.

Most Americans want to see more government action to address economic concerns. A majority say the government is doing too little to reduce inflation (81%, up 9 points since December) or fix the supply chain (73%), with about half (49%) saying it’s done too little to address student loan debt. By contrast, nearly half, 47%, say the government is doing the right amount on Covid, up 6 points since December, with the rest split on whether it’s doing too much or too little.

There is also a wide age divide over whether the government generally is doing enough to address student loan debt: Among all Americans younger than 35, 70% say the government is doing too little, dropping to 50% among those age 35 to 49, and 35% among those age 50 or older. By contrast, there’s little divide between college graduates and those without a degree.

The poll, like other recent surveys, shows Biden facing challenges with younger Americans, even within his own party. Among those younger than 45 who identify as Democrats, 80% approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency, compared with 90% among older Democrats. Eighty percent of Democrats age 45 and older approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, while just 58% of younger Democrats say the same. Younger Democrats are also about 24 points less likely to approve of Biden’s performance on the issue of helping the middle class. There’s less of a pronounced age divide within the party on Biden’s handling of immigration, the situation in Ukraine or the Covid pandemic.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults surveyed online or by phone after being recruited using probability-based methods. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points."

Watch the ceremony in the player above.

The legislation includes the most substantial federal investment in history to fight climate change — some $375 billion over the decade — and would cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 out-of-pocket annually for Medicare recipients. It also would help an estimated 13 million Americans pay for health care insurance by extending subsidies provided during the coronavirus pandemic.

The measure is paid for by new taxes on large companies and stepped-up IRS enforcement of wealthy individuals and entities, with additional funds going to reduce the federal deficit.

In a triumphant signing event at the White House, Biden pointed to the law as proof that democracy — no matter how long or messy the process — can still deliver for voters in America as he road-tested a line he will likely repeat later this fall ahead of the midterms: “The American people won, and the special interests lost.”

“In this historic moment, Democrats sided with the American people, and every single Republican in the Congress sided with the special interests in this vote,” Biden said, repeatedly seizing on the contrast between his party and the GOP. “Every single one.”

The House on Friday approved the measure on a party-line 220-207 vote. It passed the Senate days earlier with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a 50-50 tie in that chamber.

“In normal times, getting these bills done would be a huge achievement,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during the White House ceremony. “But to do it now, with only 50 Democratic votes in the Senate, over an intransigent Republican minority, is nothing short of amazing.”

Biden signed the bill into law during a small ceremony in the State Dining Room of the White House, sandwiched between his return from a six-day beachside vacation in South Carolina and his departure for his home in Wilmington, Delaware. He plans to hold a larger “celebration” for the legislation on Sept. 6 once lawmakers return to Washington.

The signing caps a spurt of legislative productivity for Biden and Congress, who in three months have approved legislation on veterans’ benefits, the semiconductor industry and gun checks for young buyers. The president and lawmakers have also responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and overwhelmingly supported NATO membership for Sweden and Finland.

With Biden’s approval rating lagging, Democrats are hoping that the string of successes will jump-start their chances of maintaining control in Washington in the November midterms. The 79-year-old president aims to restore his own standing with voters as he contemplates a reelection bid.

The White House announced Monday that it was going to deploy Biden and members of his Cabinet on a “Building a Better America Tour” to promote the recent victories. One of Biden’s trips will be to Ohio, where he’ll view the groundbreaking of a semiconductor plant that will benefit from the recent law to bolster production of such computer chips. He will also stop in Pennsylvania to promote his administration’s plan for safer communities, a visit that had been planned the same day he tested positive for COVID-19 last month.

“In the coming weeks, the President will host a Cabinet meeting focused on implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, will travel across the country to highlight how the bill will help the American people, and will host an event to celebrate the enactment of the bill at the White House on September 6th,” the White House said in a statement.

Republicans say the legislation’s new business taxes will increase prices, worsening the nation’s bout with its highest inflation since 1981. Though Democrats have labeled the measure the Inflation Reduction Act, nonpartisan analysts say it will have a barely perceptible impact on prices.

Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., on Tuesday continued those same criticisms, although he acknowledged there would be “benefit” through extensions on tax credits for renewable energy projects like solar and wind.

“I think it’s too much spending, too much taxing, and in my view wrong priorities, and a super-charged, super-sized IRS that is going to be going after a lot of not just high-income taxpayers but a lot of mid-income taxpayers,” said Thune, speaking at a Chamber of Commerce event in Sioux Falls. The administration has disputed that anyone but high earners will face increased tax scrutiny, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen directing the tax agency to focus solely on businesses and people earning more than $400,000 per year for the new audits.

The measure is a slimmed-down version of the more ambitious plan to supercharge environment and social programs that Biden and his party unveiled early last year.

Biden’s initial 10-year, $3.5 trillion proposal also envisioned free prekindergarten, paid family and medical leave, expanded Medicare benefits and eased immigration restrictions. That crashed after centrist Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said it was too costly, using the leverage every Democrat has in the evenly divided Senate.

During the signing event, Biden addressed Manchin, who struck the critical deal with Schumer on the package last month, saying, “Joe, I never had a doubt” as the crowd chuckled.

Though the law is considerably smaller than their initial ambitions, Biden and Democrats are hailing the legislation as a once-in-a-generation investment in addressing the long-term effects of climate change, as well as drought in the nation’s West.

The bill will direct spending, tax credits and loans to bolster technology like solar panels, consumer efforts to improve home energy efficiency, emission-reducing equipment for coal- and gas-powered power plants, and air pollution controls for farms, ports and low-income communities.

Another $64 billion would help 13 million people pay premiums over the next three years for privately bought health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Medicare would gain the power to negotiate its costs for pharmaceuticals, initially in 2026 for only 10 drugs. Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket prescription costs would be limited to $2,000 annually starting in 2025, and beginning next year would pay no more than $35 monthly for insulin, the costly diabetes drug.

Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a powerful political ally to Biden, noted during the White House ceremony that his late wife, Emily, who battled diabetes for three decades, would be “beyond joy” if she were alive today because of the insulin cap.

“Many seem surprised at your successes,” Clyburn told Biden. “I am not. I know you.”

The American people now believe that inflation is the most important issue facing the economy and the country, and they don’t think that President Biden is paying attention to it. This explains why so many Americans disapprove of his economic performance—and why it is undermining his presidency.

Most Americans are too young to remember the inflationary surge of the 1970s and early 1980, which is why the return of inflation has come as such a shock. Many economists were caught flat-footed as well. They argued for a year after prices began rising that this phase of the economic recovery would be “transitory”—until last week’s announcement that the annual rate of inflation had reached 7.5%. The news administered the coup de grace to this unfortunate adjective and vindicated the views of dissenting economists such as Larry Summers and Jason Furman that inflation was likely to be persistent. The Biden administration remained publicly hopeful about inflation until developments in recent months made its optimism untenable.

In a recent CBS/YouGov survey, 58% of Americans said that Biden wasn’t focusing enough on the economy and even more—65%—said this about inflation. Only 33% say that Biden and the Democrats are focusing on issues they care about the most. According to a CNN poll, 7 in 10 Americans think the government isn’t doing enough to reduce inflation and relieve disruptions in the supply-chain. Against this backdrop, it’s not surprising that just 38% approve of the president’s handling of the economy and even fewer—30%— his handling of inflation .

A recent Economist/YouGov survey shows that inflation has become the dominant factor determining the voters’ view of the economy. Asked to identify the “best measure” of how the economy is doing, 52% pointed to the cost of goods and services, compared to 17% for unemployment and jobs and just 6% for the stock market. Although the Biden administration wants Americans to focus on rapid job creation and the sharp decline in unemployment, it seems that the people are more likely to emphasize rising prices until the pace of inflation abates.

Since the New Deal, Americans have come to believe that presidents exercise considerable control over the economy, and they expect President Biden to do something about inflation. Shortages of goods on grocery store shelves and delays receiving goods ordered online have convinced the people that unclogging the supply chain is an important part of the solution. But despite the administration’s claims, they haven’t seen much progress on this front. The contrast between the high visibility of the pandemic task force and the virtual disappearance of supply chain task force has been dramatic, especially because the people now care more about rising prices than falling infection rates.

In the absence of a high-profile anti-inflation effort, the people are reaching their own conclusions about the administration’s agenda. According to a Politico/Harvard survey, 46% believe that enacting the Build Back Better (BBB) proposal would increase the rate of inflation; just 6% think that it would decrease inflation. Attitudes about the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which President Biden has already signed into law, are very similar."

Story Highlights 41% of Americans approve of job Biden is doing overall

Issue approval ratings mostly steady

36% approve of his handling situation with Russia

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Forty-one percent of U.S. adults approve of the job Joe Biden is doing as president, similar to his 40% rating for handling foreign affairs, while approval of his handling the economy and the situation with Russia are slightly lower. Americans give Biden better marks for his response to the coronavirus, but still fewer than half approve.

These ratings from a Feb. 1-17 Gallup poll are little changed from the prior readings, including a January measure of his overall job performance and November ratings for the economy, foreign affairs and the coronavirus response. Gallup last measured Biden's performance on Russia in August.

Biden's overall job approval has shown no meaningful improvement since last fall when it declined after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. High inflation and the continuing coronavirus pandemic are likely two factors keeping Biden's approval rating down.

The trends in approval of Biden's handling of specific issues follow the same trajectory as the trend in his overall approval rating. The issue approval ratings were above the majority level early in his presidency, showed a significant drop in the summer of 2021, and dropped further in the fall.

Americans' approval of Biden for handling the coronavirus situation has consistently been his best among these issues, averaging eight percentage points higher than his foreign affairs and economic approval ratings.

Slump Among Democrats Continues

Biden's overall job approval among his fellow Democrats continues to hold near 80% after being consistently above 90% early in his term. In the latest survey, 79% of Democrats approve.

Over the course of his presidency, Biden's job ratings have fallen the most among independents, among whom 35% currently approve, compared with ratings in the high 50s to low 60s in his initial months as president.

Republicans' ratings of Biden have always been low; currently, 7% approve of him. Biden averaged 10% approval among Republicans through July 2021 but has averaged 6% since then.

Line graph. Trend in Biden's job approval ratings by political party. Currently, 79% of Democrats approve of how Biden is handling his job as president, down from readings above 90% between January-November 2021. Biden's approval among independents is 35%. It was 61% in the first Gallup poll measuring Biden job approval and in the 50s through June, before dropping to 43% in August. Biden's approval among Republicans is 7% in the latest poll and has been mostly in the single digits since August.

Significantly fewer Democrats approve of how Biden is handling the economy (72%), foreign affairs (71%) and the Russian situation (64%) than approve of his overall performance. Democrats' approval for the president's handling of the coronavirus response is similar to their evaluation of the job he is doing overall.

Independents are most critical of Biden's economic stewardship, with 30% approving, compared with ratings of 35% or higher on the other issues. Republicans also rate Biden slightly worse on the economy than on the other issues.

Approval of President Joe Biden Handling of Issues, by Political Party Democrats Independents Republicans % % % The response to the coronavirus 81 45 12 Foreign affairs 71 37 10 The economy 72 30 6 The situation with Russia 64 35 11 Gallup Feb. 1-17, 2022

Bottom Line

President Biden's overall job approval score is stuck in the low 40s, and Americans are no more positive about his handling of key issues, except for the coronavirus response. But even on that issue, less than half of Americans approve of the job he is doing.

Since the honeymoon phase of his presidency, Biden has seen his support drop among all political groups. His ratings among Republicans cannot go much lower, so further declines in his approval rating depend on whether Democrats' and independents' evaluations of him worsen.

The experiences of Biden's immediate predecessors, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, could shed light on how much lower his approval could go among Democrats and independents. Like Biden, Trump and Obama governed in an era during which their job approval was characterized by exceedingly high ratings among their fellow partisans and exceedingly low ratings among the other party's supporters.

The low point for Donald Trump among his fellow Republicans was 77%, while Barack Obama's lowest among Democrats was 74%, so Biden may be near his theoretical low water mark among Democrats.

Trump generally fared worse among independents than Biden has to date -- with Trump never exceeding 48% among non-affiliated Americans. Trump's low point among independents was 29%, while Obama's support among independents bottomed out at 31%. Again, Biden may be near his low point for independents if his experience ends up being similar to Trump and Obama.

Biden's ability to navigate the current conflict with Russia, take steps to combat inflation, and preside over a now improving COVID-19 situation will be key factors in determining whether he can regain support among Democrats and independents and improve his overall job rating.

President Joe Biden’s student loan plan is a potential game changer for Americans drowning in debt. And yet the impact on the economy at large is likely to be so tiny that it will be hard to measure.

Biden announced Wednesday that his administration will forgive $10,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 per year. Low-income borrowers who went to college on Pell Grants will receive up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.

This debt relief will give tens of millions of borrowers some breathing room at a time when the cost of living has skyrocketed.

Critically, the cancellation of student debt is being paired with a plan to lift the freeze on federal student debt payments, beginning in January 2023. That means many Americans who haven’t had to pay down student loans since March 2020 will have to begin doing so, eating into their cash flows.

Despite fears that Biden’s student debt relief will fuel already-crippling inflation, economists say the combined impact will be minimal on the economy at large.

“The end of the moratorium will weigh on growth and inflation, while the debt forgiveness will support growth and inflation,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN. “The net of these cross-currents is largely a wash.”

Moody’s estimates that the combined impact will reduce real GDP in 2023 by 0.05 percentage points, drive down unemployment by 0.02 percentage points and cut inflation by 0.03 percentage points. In other words, a very tiny effect.

“We’re not talking about raising or lowering inflation by a percentage point or even a half a percentage point. We’re talking about a really small impact,” Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CNN in a phone interview. “But for individuals this makes a big difference. It wipes out more than half the debt for more than half the borrowers. That’s a big deal.”

Tens of millions of borrowers impacted

The typical undergraduate student with loans graduates with nearly $25,000 in debt, according to a Department of Education analysis cited by the White House.

Up to 43 million borrowers will receive relief from Biden’s student debt plan, including eliminating the full remaining balance for about 20 million borrowers, according to the White House.

The inflationary impact would have been larger if Biden did not impose an income threshold on the debt relief or if he heeded calls from some progressives to wipe out $50,000 in student debt.

Baker praised Biden’s plan as a “good compromise” that avoided going to extremes.

“It’s helping people out, but not giving away the store,” he said.

Some groups, including the NAACP, argue Biden’s debt relief doesn’t go far enough given the mountain of student debt in America.

“Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,” NAACP leaders wrote in a CNN Business opinion piece.

A $300 billion price tag

Of course, there is a cost to canceling student debt. And that cost will be picked up by taxpayers just when deficit reduction had suddenly become a bipartisan trend in Washington.

A one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning less than $125,000 will cost the government approximately $300 billion, according to an estimate this week from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. (The Penn Wharton model did not include the cost of wiping out up to $20,000 in student debt for Pell Grant recipients).

Although $300 billion isn’t massive for a $25 trillion economy, the cost of the student debt forgiveness would cancel out the projected federal budget deficit savings from the just-passed Inflation Reduction Act.

“All the deficit reduction will be wiped out,” Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow.

Note that the White House has hailed the deficit reduction aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act as an important inflation-fighting measure. And this marked a significant shift after years of both parties adding to America’s mountain of debt to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

Even Jason Furman, head of the Council of Economic Advisers for former President Barack Obama, has doubts about Biden’s plan.

“Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless,” Furman tweeted. “Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.”

Still, said Zandi of Moody’s, this is a “big positive deal for probably close to 40 million, mostly lower and middle income, Americans, but [a] small negative deal for all American taxpayers.”

‘Sends the wrong message’

Beyond the economic impact, Biden’s plan has sparked questions about fairness because it only helps people who were fortunate enough to go to college.

Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Senate Democratic nominee, said Biden’s decision on student debt “sends the wrong message to the millions of Ohioans without a degree working just as hard to make ends meet.”

“Instead of forgiving student loans for six-figure earners, we should be working to level the playing field for all Americans,” Ryan said.

Citing a Department of Education analysis, the White House said nearly 90% of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000.

The student debt forgiveness comes too late for borrowers who worked for years to pay off their loans, only to now see others have their debt wiped away.

“I take that very seriously,” Baker said of the fairness concerns. “We’re relieving $10,000, not $50,000 or $100,000. That’s why $10,000 is a good number.”

The real problem continues

No matter the amount, wiping out student loan debt doesn’t address the underlying problem: College tuition is way too expensive.

Between 2000 and 2021, the cost of college tuition increased at more than twice the pace of overall inflation, according to Moody’s Analytics. That’s despite a slowdown in tuition hikes during Covid.

The basket of goods measured in the Consumer Price Index cost 57% more in 2021 than it did in 2000, while the cost of college tuition soared by 167%, Moody’s said.

It’s hard to see how eliminating a chunk of student debt solves that issue. And some, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have warned debt relief could also help raise tuitions.

“Costs are out of control. It’s absurd people have to borrow large amounts and then struggle to pay it back,” said Baker. “That problem is unsolved.”"

Biden identified four crises facing America: the coronavirus, the climate, the economy and racial justice. He could have added a fifth: a crisis of democracy in a divided nation where, just two weeks earlier, the Capitol had been overrun by insurrectionists.

How has he fared on all five counts?

Coronavirus

Biden took office pledging to lift the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, which he called “a raging virus” that “silently stalks the country”. And there was a period of his presidency when it appeared he had.

Last summer vaccination rates soared as the virus receded and the economy rebounded. Touting the administration’s progress at an Independence Day celebration, Biden declared that the US was “closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus”.

But then came the arrival of the Delta variant, followed by the extremely transmissible Omicron variant. Biden rushed once again to restrict travel but it did little to slow the spread. In recent weeks, Covid-19 cases have reached record levels. Deaths are rising nationally and the number of Americans hospitalized with the disease is higher now than at any previous point during the pandemic.

Long lines to obtain Covid tests and low availability of at-home tests have sparked criticism of the White House’s preparedness, while shifting guidelines and muddled messaging from federal public health officials left a disease-weary public confused and frustrated. Public confidence in Biden’s handling of the pandemic has dropped significantly, weighing down his overall approval ratings.

Biden responded by ordering 1bn at-home coronavirus tests and is requiring private insurance companies to cover the cost of up to eight of these tests a month. Biden also announced plans to make “high-quality” masks available to Americans free of charge and deployed military medical units to help hospitals overwhelmed by a shortage of staff and beds. Leveraging the Defense Production Act, the administration is working with pharmaceutical companies to increase the supply of antiviral pills.

More than 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated, with nearly 77 million receiving a booster shot. Efforts to improve vaccination rates continue to be undermined by partisanship and misinformation. And a ruling by the supreme court this week blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-test mandate for large businesses, though it allowed a vaccine mandate for most healthcare workers to take effect.

In response to the latest wave, the Biden administration has shifted its rhetoric – and its expectations. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, said the Omicron variant would “find just about everybody”, warning that the unvaccinated risk far worse outcomes.

Climate

In his inaugural address, Biden promised to heed the planet’s “cry for survival” by marshalling an unprecedented response to the climate crisis. But his ambitious plans have since collided with the reality of an evenly divided Senate, where a coal-state senator’s opposition has thwarted major pieces of the president’s climate agenda, with potentially dire consequences for the planet.

At the international talks in Glasgow last year, Biden pledged the US would slash its greenhouse gas emissions in half compared with 2005 levels by the end of this decade. But failure to enact the president’s Build Back Better legislation would make it nearly impossible for the US to meet that target.

The roughly $2tn proposal would amount to the nation’s largest ever investment in combatting climate change and contains a suite of tax incentives, grants and other policies that would grow the green energy sector and invest in sustainable vehicles and public transport services. Without it, the Biden administration would be forced to rely on a raft of environmental regulations and rules that could be overturned by future presidents.

Throughout the first year of his presidency, Biden has made climate change a priority, elevating climate advocates to key posts, creating a White House office of domestic policy, and appointing John Kerry as the special presidential envoy for climate, which he made a cabinet-level position. In April, he convened a summit to pressure world leaders to make stronger commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reassert US leadership on the global stage.

Biden used his executive authority to quickly reverse many of former president Donald Trump’s energy and environmental policies, starting with his first day in office when he moved to rejoin the Paris climate accords.

In November, Biden signed into law a $1tn bipartisan infrastructure bill that provides billions of dollars to make communities more resilient to climate-fueled disasters, but did little to reduce planet-warming emissions.

At the international talks last year, the US played a major role in negotiations over global efforts to fight climate change, though the final agreement disappointed activists and some world leaders. “This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, an existential threat to human existence as we know it and every day we delay the cost of inaction increases,” Biden said in Glasgow.

Yet the coming weeks and months will be critical for Biden’s climate goals, and his legacy. The president’s Build Back Better legislation is doomed without Senator Joe Manchin’s support and it remains unclear if negotiations can be revived. Next month the supreme court will hear a case brought by Republican-led states and coal companies that could significantly restrict the administration’s power to regulate carbon emissions driving climate change.

And if Republicans gain control of Congress in this year’s midterm elections, action on climate change could stall, potentially for years.

Economy

It is the best of times and the worst of times. The White House ended 2021 pointing to jobless claims at a 50-year low, a stock market smashing records and an economy among the fastest growing in the world.

On the positive side, 6.4m jobs have been added under Biden, the most of any first-year president in history. When he took office the unemployment rate was 6.3%; today it is 3.9%, the lowest yet of the pandemic.

Consumer demand is strong, helping the economy grow by an estimated 7% in the final quarter of 2021, although the Omicron variant, which has ravaged airlines and restaurants, is likely to cause a slowdown.

Wages are also up. With a record wave of people quitting their jobs, often to seek work elsewhere, average hourly pay jumped 4.7% in December compared with a year ago.

The stock market is thriving. In 2021 the Standard and Poor 500 index hit new records 70 times and finished up 29%. This beat Donald Trump’s first year as president when the S&P 500 hit new records 62 times and finished up 17%.

There is, of course, a “but” coming. The economy is still about 3.6m jobs short of its pre-pandemic level. Many employers are struggling to fill positions and many people are reluctant to return to the workforce.

Most dauntingly, inflation climbed to 7% in 2021, the biggest 12-month gain for 40 years, while supply chain problems left some supermarket shelves bare. This prompted a barrage of Republican criticism and fed a feeling of economic malaise, whatever the reality.

Allan Lichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University in Washington, said: “The economy is actually better than the perception. Unemployment is down to 3.9%. Many millions of jobs were created and you’re going to get inflation under those circumstances. But the message hasn’t gotten out. Everybody thinks Biden’s done a poor job.”

Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and strategist, instead argues that Biden overpromised. “The entire economy is seizing up, and people do blame Biden because he was trumpeting how successful he had been,” he said. “Don’t do that.”

Racial justice

“President Biden met with some of the civil rights leadership and we reminded him …You said the night you won that Black America had your back and that you were going to have Black America’s back,” activist Al Sharpton told a voting rights rally in August. “Well, Mr President, they’re stabbing us in the back.”

Biden is yet to fulfil his promise. But he has met some of his commitments to embed racial equity in policy. The early $1.9tn coronavirus relief package included $5bn for Black farmers, the most important legislation for this group since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Biden named a historically diverse administration that includes, in interior secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary. Kamala Harris is the first woman of colour to serve as vice-president, though she has been handed intractable problems to solve and her approval rating is even lower than Biden’s.

But police reform efforts have stalled. Biden abandoned a campaign promise to create a national police oversight commission in his first hundred days.

Talks in Congress over the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which aims to improve police training, curb use of excessive force and end techniques such as chokeholds, collapsed in September in what Jacari Harris, executive director of a foundation named after Floyd, described as “a devastating setback”.

Most dramatically, the president’s lobbying efforts have failed to deliver on protecting voting rights for people of colour. National legislation aimed at blunting Republican-led state efforts to impose voter restrictions has stalled in the Senate, where a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans leaves no margin for error.

Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have declared their opposition to reform of a procedural rule known as the filibuster, a necessary step for passing the legislation. Biden is accused by critics of doing too little too late, failing to use his bully pulpit to give the issue the same priority as his bipartisan infrastructure law.

In a sign of the disappointment and exasperation, when Biden travelled to Atlanta this week to make his most aggressive case yet for filibuster reform, some campaigners boycotted the event.

Charles Blow, a columnist for the New York Times, wrote: “For a year, activists have been screaming and pleading and begging and getting arrested, trying to get the White House to put the full weight of the presidency behind protecting voting rights, only to be met by silence or soft-pedaling.”

He added: “When Biden fully entered the battle, the other warriors were already bloody, bruised and exhausted.”

Democracy

In his inaugural address, Biden proclaimed: “We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.” Restoring the soul of the nation, he added, requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: “Unity.”

Nearly a year later, back at the US Capitol, Biden struck a very different and more pugnacious tone. “I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy,” he vowed, signaling a belated realisation that instead of repairing the breach with Republicans, he must now stand in it and fight.

Biden, who had run for election as an apostle of bipartisanship, and did get a win with Republican support for a $1tn infrastructure law. But the radicalised opposition party remains implacably opposed to legislation that would codify national protections for voting rights (see above).

Republicans remain in the iron grip of Trump, his “big lie” that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and the delusion that the January 6 insurrection was inconsequential or even a righteous cause.

Trump acolytes and election deniers are now seeking office as secretaries of state and other positions that would put them in charge of running of future elections. This could given them the power to overturn results they do not like.

This year Biden has begun to speak out forcefully on the voting rights issue – “Do you want to be the side of Dr King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?” he demanded in Atlanta – but less so on the more insidious, precinct-by-precinct threat to the electoral process.

Tony Evers, the Democratic governor of Wisconsin, told the Guardian last month: “At the state level we’re raising hell about it but the Democrats on the national level are talking about Build Back Better, the infrastructure bill, lots of other things.”

Biden’s mission to heal divisions has crashed into polarisation that has only been accelerated by the pandemic and its battles over mask and vaccine mandates, as well as Republican-stoked culture wars over schools and critical race theory. Far from fading away, Trump is resuming campaign rallies ahead of a possible run for the White House in 2024."

The Biden White House is betting the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand these threats, but there are growing fears of a coming economic slump among voters and some Wall Street analysts.

The next few months will test whether President Joe Biden built a durable recovery full of jobs with last year’s $1.9 trillion relief package, or an economy overfed by government aid that could tip into a downturn. On the line for Democrats ahead of the midterm elections is whether voters see firsthand in their lives that inflation can be tamed and the economy can manage to run hot without overheating.

Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters this week that the 3.6 percent unemployment rate and last year’s robust growth puts the U.S. in a safe place compared to the rest of the world.

“The core question is whether the strength of the US economy is now an asset or a liability,” Deese said. “What we have done over the course of the last 15 months is driven a uniquely strong economic recovery in the United States, which positions us uniquely well to deal with the challenges ahead.”

But others see an economy that could struggle to preserve growth while reducing inflation now running at a 40-year high of 7.9 percent. The Federal Reserve has signaled a series of benchmark interest rate increases and other policies to slow inflation this year, yet Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has destabilized the global energy and food markets in ways that could push prices upward.

Deutsche Bank on Tuesday became the first major financial institution to forecast a U.S. recession. And Harvard University economist Larry Summers — a Democrat and former treasury secretary — noted that the U.S. economy has gone into recession within two years each time inflation eclipsed 4 percent and unemployment was below 5 percent as they are now.

Joe LaVorgna, who worked in the Trump White House and is now chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, said he expects economic growth this year to be just below 1 percent, a potentially dangerous level.

While household balance sheets are solid and unemployment low, wages are not keeping up with inflation, which could dampen consumer spending. And supply chain disruptions and higher energy costs will be additional drags.

“The reason why you have a recession when the economy is growing 1 percent is it’s like a weakened immune system,” LaVorgna said. “Any negative event, even a small one, is going to throw you off course and stall speed becomes a recession.”

Still, because of the strong labor market and household savings, LaVorgna also anticipates that any downturn would be mild.

So far, consumer spending has been healthy even if the public views the economy as anemic.

Nearly 7 in 10 Americans believe the economy is in poor shape, according to a poll last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet Bank of America noted that total debit and credit card spending in March was up 11 percent from a year ago, and its analysts concluded households are “strong enough to weather the storm provided it doesn’t persist too long.”

There are also signs that consumers are adjusting as higher oil prices have led average gasoline costs to hit $4.15 a gallon, according to AAA. Gas costs have fallen in the past week, but they’re still up 45 percent from a year ago.

WATCH: House Democrats accuse oil companies of ‘rip off’ on gas prices in hearing

One consequence of higher prices is that Americans began to use less oil and gas. The U.S. consumed a daily average of 21.9 million barrels during the first full week of February; the figure fell 9 percent to 19.9 million barrels during the first week of April, according to the Energy Information Administration. That decline is larger than the normal seasonal drop-off in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic. Gasoline usage has dropped more than 6 percent during the same period.

A recent Goldman Sachs research note stood out to Biden administration officials because it suggested that job growth and pay increases would cushion the economy from higher commodity prices. Because of the strong labor market, the economy is better protected from commodity shocks than in the recessions of 1974, 1980 and 1990, as well as the 2008 financial crisis.

The White House has watched with some frustration as the public conversation about the economy has been reduced to inflation, believing that largely ignores the strength of the labor market and the idea that families are able to manage the higher prices because of the coronavirus relief provided earlier.

The administration believes that Fed rate increases as well as a drop in deficit spending this year will help to lower inflation. But the key message that the White House wants to deliver in response to public fears about the economy is that Biden understands their concerns.

The challenge, however, is that many Americans are so focused on inflation that they believe the job market — and wider economy — is weaker than it actually is. That means the White House has to make a nuanced case in which it recognizes the economic weaknesses but repeats the low unemployment rate again, again and again so that it lodges in the public mind.

The doubts about the economy — despite the solid jobs numbers — are “a signal that we need to continue to make that case clearly and unambiguously,” said Deese."

Since Biden took office last year, job growth has been vigorous and steady — as he told the country Friday after the March jobs report showed the addition of 431,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to a low 3.6%. But those same remarks were also tempered by his recognition that food and gas prices are too high and inflation is at its worst level in a generation.

For Biden, convincing Americans of the progress made in the economic recovery only serves as a salient reminder of how much further the country has to go.

“Our economy has gone from being on the mend, to being on the move,” Biden said, even as he acknowledged Americans are not ready for a victory lap. “I know that this job is not finished: We need to do more to get prices under control.”

WATCH: Biden says economy ‘on the move’ after strong March jobs report

At times, Biden’s bifurcated messaging — like the state of the economy itself — can seem like a jumble of contradictions. It leaves voters to piece together their own opinions — potentially to the president’s political peril.

Record wage gains of 5.6% over the past year, for example, run up against consumer prices that have risen at 7.9% annually. Biden’s announcement this past week of plans to release a million barrels of oil daily from the U.S. strategic reserve over the next six months was a recognition of the harm that inflation can have not just on the economy but his own policy ambitions.

The economic discontent is reflected in Biden’s standing in public opinion polls.

Roughly 7 in 10 people in the United States describe the economy as being in poor shape, while nearly two-thirds disapprove of Biden’s economic leadership, according to a March poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Administration officials and Biden allies happily point to the job creation data as a sign of accomplishment but they are also perturbed by the lingering economic malaise that threatens him with a historically inhospitable environment for a president’s party in a midterm year.

They have advised Biden to spotlight his work to bring down gas prices and forthcoming efforts to try to curtail an increase in food prices from the war raging in the world’s breadbasket of Ukraine.

It is not just the family budget he is targeting. Biden’s latest message to voters is that he can bring the nation’s finances under control too.

His annual budget request highlighted a $1 trillion decrease in the deficit over 10 years, an effort to claim the mantle of fiscal steward even as the reduction was driven by the expiration of COVID-19 relief programs that are no longer necessary and a new plan for a minimum tax on the nation’s billionaires.

“Responsible fiscal accountability is always a priority with voters,” said Democratic pollster John Anzalone, who advised Biden’s 2020 campaign. “I think people want fiscal accountability. And I don’t think that’s changed over the years.”

Biden aides also hope he can spend more time focusing on other ways that government is working to make concrete changes in peoples’ lives, with infrastructure investments and the improving economy.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, said there seemed to be a “disconnect” between Biden’s legislative achievements and his handling of the war in Ukraine, and the public’s understanding.

“I’m well aware that midterms are obviously always difficult for the party in power, but we’ve got a great story to tell,” she told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “There is a lot of good accomplishments to be putting up on the board and the Democrats in office and out need to be doing a better job of making the case.”

Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., said Wednesday after meeting with Biden that his messaging over the past month has clearly targeted moderate voters.

“ The State of the Union was spot on in terms of what constituents in our districts, purple districts, are talking about right now,” she said outside the White House. She noted Biden’s pivot to addressing mental health issues after the pandemic, while also emphasizing that the president plans to run on infrastructure and job creation.

READ MORE: Biden orders release of 1 million barrels oil a day from strategic reserve to hit brakes on gas prices

Voters have interpreted the pandemic, the recession, the burst of government spending, the swift recovery and the inflation that followed with a sense of pessimism.

The University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment included a partisan breakdown of numbers that shows growing anxiety among the Democrats whom Biden needs to turn out in 2022. Democrats’ expectations for the economy have been dropping since July, while independents’ expectations for the economy are at the lowest level since 2008 when the country was mired in the Great Recession.

Oil and gasoline prices have been a driver of this skepticism. Crude oil prices started the year at roughly $76 a barrel, spiked to about $124 on March 8 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and appeared to settle just below $100 on Friday after Biden had announced the release from the reserves.

Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the market reaction to Biden’s release of petroleum “muted” and noted that “in the short term we are subject to the whims of outside developments like the Russian invasion.”

University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, whose work is separate from the sentiment survey, noted there is evidence that the public’s perception of inflation may be worse than actual inflation. That’s because gasoline, food and other items where prices are openly displayed are key drivers of higher prices, possibly giving inflation an outsize psychological impact.

Wolfers has done academic work on the impact oil prices have on gubernatorial elections, but he noted that historical comparisons might not work after the financial and cultural impact of a pandemic that has scrambled expectations.

“Were I Biden, I’d be using some version of a ‘better off than you were four years ago,’” Wolfers said. He said voters need to remember June 2020, when the world was gripped by the pandemic, the government was providing misleading information about the pandemic, the economy was terrible and “you also didn’t know whether you were going to die.”

“How do you feel now? That would be the argument,” he said.

WASHINGTON — The Biden-Harris administration today announced $2.3 million from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create good-paying union jobs and catalyze economic opportunity by reclaiming abandoned mine lands (AML) in Alaska (receiving $1.33 million) and Texas (receiving $986,367). The Department of the Interior has made $725 million available to 22 states and the Navajo Nation in fiscal year 2022.

Millions of Americans nationwide live within just one mile of an abandoned coal mine or orphaned oil and gas well. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates a total of $11.3 billion in AML funding over 15 years, facilitated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). This historic funding is expected to address the vast majority of inventoried abandoned coal mine lands in this country, which will help communities eliminate dangerous environmental conditions and pollution caused by past coal mining.

“I know first-hand what it’s like to live near a toxic, abandoned mine. In communities like my Pueblo of Laguna, people deal with the serious risks to our environment and our health that legacy pollution poses,” said Secretary Deb Haaland. “We have a once-in-a-generation investment to address abandoned mine lands. Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I believe the reclamation landscape of tomorrow presents endless opportunities for innovation, efficiency and partnership.”

The Department has announced over $642 million in awards in the last two months for Alabama, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Funding will be awarded to additional eligible entities on a rolling basis as they apply.

AML reclamation supports jobs in coal communities by investing in projects that close dangerous mine shafts, reclaim unstable slopes, improve water quality by treating acid mine drainage, and restore water supplies damaged by mining. It also enables economic revitalization by reclaiming hazardous land for recreational facilities and other economic redevelopment uses like advanced manufacturing and renewable energy deployment. As required by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, funding will prioritize projects that employ dislocated coal industry workers.

This funding will enable states to remediate abandoned mines that are leaking methane – a key contributor to climate change. This comes as part of the Biden-Harris administration’s unprecedented investments in coal, oil and gas and power plant communities. This effort also advances the President’s Justice40 Initiative which commits to delivering 40% of the benefits of certain climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.

As required by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, allocations are determined based on the number of tons of coal historically produced in each state or on Indian lands before August 3, 1977, when the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) was enacted. States are guaranteed at least $20 million over the 15-year life of the program if their inventory of AML sites would cost more than $20 million to address. As state AML inventories are updated, future distributions will change.

These investments supplement traditional annual AML grants, which are funded by coal operators and ensured to be provided through 2034, thanks to language in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Under the AML reclamation program, OSMRE has provided more than $8 billion to reclaim lands and waters that were mined or affected by mining prior to 1977, when SMCRA was enacted by Congress.

One year into Joe Biden’s presidency and the economic news is decidedly mixed. Despite promising numbers in several key areas, inflation is dampening Americans’ view of the economy. We take a look at important economic indicators across the past year.

Jobs market recovery

You can’t blame President Biden for taking a victory lap where the United States jobs market is concerned. When he was sworn in on January 22, 2021, the nation’s unemployment rate was 6.9 percent. It’s currently 3.9 percent.

Last month was the first time since the pandemic struck that the jobless rate dipped below 4 percent as it closed in on its pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent from February 2020.

But the economy only created a disappointing 199,000 jobs in December. For the whole of 2021, job growth averaged 537,000 a month. That leaves the US 3.6 million jobs shy of regaining all of the 22 million jobs lost in the opening months of the pandemic back in 2020.

But don’t let that gap fool you. The jobs market is on fire in the US. So much so that American workers haven’t enjoyed this kind of bargaining power for decades.

‘I quit’

To get an idea of just how hot the jobs market is in the US, take a look at how many Americans are telling their bosses, “I quit”.

A record 4.5 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in November, signalling that workers feel very confident about their employment prospects. That’s not surprising given job openings on the final day of November were also near a record high.

To lure scarce job seekers, businesses have been boosting pay and sweetening benefits packages. That trend continued in December, with average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increasing 4.7 percent from a year ago.

But fatter paycheques, while welcome, are not stretching as far as they did before Biden took office, thanks to surging inflation.

Inflation

Feel like putting on a pair of leg warmers and doing some jazzercise to Olivia Newton John’s, Physical?

Well, that vibe you’re feeling could be down to the early 1980s-like inflation in the US.

The consumer price index increased 7 percent in December compared with the same period a year ago. That is the sharpest 12-month spike since June 1982.

No one likes rising prices, but this year’s inflation has been especially hard on low-income households. Inflation, especially for essentials such as food, petrol and housing, has consumed a larger share of their financial resources.

So even though the jobs market is recovering nicely, and workers are in a great bargaining position to secure better pay and benefits, mounting price pressures are making American feel less optimistic about the economy.

Consumer confidence

What do you get when you combine soaring inflation with surging Omicron infections? A dip in consumer confidence.

The latest survey by the University of Michigan suggested consumer sentiment fell in January to its second-lowest level in a decade.

That’s definitely concerning because when consumers don’t feel good about the economy, they tend to be more tight-fisted with money. And consumer spending accounts for some two-thirds of US economic growth.

The University of Michigan survey indicated that three-quarters of Americans think inflation is a bigger problem for the nation right now than jobs. Meanwhile, a third reported being worse off financially compared with a year ago.

That is definitely clouding how Americans feel about Biden’s leadership.

A Quinnipiac University national poll published earlier this month indicated only 34 percent of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, while 57 percent disapprove."

Something similar might be said of recent U.S. economic policy management. To have budget policy be run in an irresponsible way is unfortunate. To have the Federal Reserve amplify budget policy mismanagement by an inappropriate monetary policy stance is to be deeply regretted.

Such budget and Fed policy mismanagement have already brought us multi-decade-high inflation and bubbles in the housing, equity, and credit markets. It now threatens to invite a hard economic landing and an asset price bust as past inflationary excesses have to be corrected.

President Biden’s March 2021 $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was characterized correctly by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers as the most irresponsible budget policy measure in the past forty years. On top of the $3 trillion 2020 bipartisan budget stimulus response to the Covid-induced recession, the Biden stimulus meant that the U.S. economy would receive 2020 bipartisan budget stimulus response to the Covid-induced recession, the Biden stimulus meant that the U.S. economy would be receiving a staggering 20 percent of GDP budget boost. That was bound to lead to economic overheating and inflation.

As if to ensure that the country got into inflationary trouble, the Fed chose to amplify Mr. Biden’s budget policy irresponsibility with the maintenance of the easiest of monetary policies. Not only did the Fed keep interest rates at their zero lower bound even as the economy was recovering and receiving its largest peacetime budget stimulus on record, the Fed kept buying $120 billion a month in US Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities even at a time when the equity and housing markets were on fire.

With so much budget and monetary policy stimulus, it was a small wonder then that consumer price inflation rose to over 9 percent by mid-2022 or to a level that we had not seen since the early 1980s. With interest rates so low and with so much Fed bond buying, it was little wonder that equity valuations reached nosebleed levels seen only once before one hundred years and that house prices exceeded their pre-2006 peak even in inflation-adjusted terms.

Seeming to have learned little from last year’s-experience of creating asset price and credit market bubbles by flooding the market with liquidity, the Fed is now choosing to withdraw liquidity at an unprecedented pace at the very time when financial markets are on the back foot. It is doing so by committing itself not to roll over $95 billion a month in its maturing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

All of this does not bode well for our chances of avoiding a nasty economic recession and financial market stress next year. The good news is that the Biden Administration can be held to account for its gross economic policy mismanagement in the 2024 election. The bad news is that the same cannot be said for Mr. Powell and the rest of the Federal Reserve Board for their monetary policy incompetence."

That’s changed under President Biden,” said top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) on “Sunday Night in America” on Fox News.

Asked about how the U.S. economy would fare facing rising energy costs and economic fallout from Europe, Rep. Brady said:

“This could hurt consumers further. But make no mistake: This inflation we’re seeing right now is at record levels. Wholesale prices grew at twice the rate that was projected just last week. That is certain to fuel inflation higher and longer. “Housing prices, whether you’re renting, or you’re buying, have surged. That hasn’t even shown up in the inflation measurements yet. And that’s about a third of what inflation is.

Rep. Brady warned that Democrats’ policies are worsening inflation and have brought the economy to the brink of a wage-price spiral:

“And of course, we’ve got this now accelerating wage inflation. So there is a big concern that we’re going to see prices go up higher. “The basis of it all right now continues to be massive government spending that fuels inflation and not enough workers because of the policies of President Biden. “I worry that we are either on the verge of – or in – a wage price spiral, which is something you don’t want, because inevitably the only way to break that spiral is through a recession.”

Michelle Cordero: From The Heritage Foundation, I’m Michelle Cordero. And this is Heritage Explains. Last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported what we already knew. Biden's economy is in bad shape and we are officially in a recession.

Clip: Here we go. What a day. Moments ago, U.S. economy shrinking for the second straight quarter. That means a recession is well underway.

>>> America Is In A Recession, No Matter How Biden Tries To Spin It

Clip: From the White House tonight, what is a recession? Does it matter? And why the President is denying something a majority of Americans say is happening? Today, the GDP numbers came out for the second straight quarter. The economy contracted. In other words, GDP growth was negative. That by almost every conventional definition is a recession. That's how it looks right now. In other words, the data supports what you are feeling about your money in a word: uncertain. In three words, uncertain and probably a little bit scared.

President Joe Biden: There’s going to be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession. But if you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter as well.

Tucker Carlson: That’s unbelievable. And I’m asking you, I know you're an economist, I’m asking you a political question, but very quickly, wouldn't it be smarter for the White House to say, look, we know how bad it is and we're doing everything we can to help you? Why do they persist in telling us something we know isn't true?

EJ Antoni: Well, Tucker, I think it speaks to the aloofness and how disconnected these people are from reality and from the everyday conditions that the average American family has to deal with. For example, these people don't worry about the price of food. They don't even cook their own food. They don't worry about the price of gasoline because they don't have to fill up their chauffeured vehicle that the taxpayers are paying for. They are completely disconnected from the average man.

Cordero: That last clip was Tucker Carlson on Fox News with our guests today, EJ Antoni, a research fellow for regional economics in Heritage’s Center for Data Analysis. And Antoni’s going to quickly chat with us about what exactly marks a recession. And more importantly, looking beyond politics and definitions, we’ll focus on explaining what everyday Americans who make their own food and pump their own gas should expect now that the recession is official. Our conversation is up next.

Cordero: EJ, thank you so much for joining us.

EJ Antoni: My pleasure. Thank you for having me.

Cordero: Okay. So I want to talk to you today about the recession, but at a 101 level. So let's start at the beginning. There's been a lot of chatter around this question lately. What is a recession or should I say, how does an economy mark a recession?

Antoni: Sure. Well, what a recession is essentially is just when the economy is shrinking instead of growing. So over time, we want that pie to grow. And whether or not you have more people, ideally you do have more people, but whether you do or not, you have a bigger pie that you can divide among all those people. In other words, people are going to be better off. We're literally going to have more stuff that everyone can can share in this economy. So when we have a recession, we have exactly the opposite of that. The pie is shrinking, which isn't good because now we have less stuff and you may think, okay, well, so what? Stop being so greedy. I'm not just talking about luxury items like yachts, I'm talking things like medicine, food, energy, things that we need to survive. This is not simply a matter of people being better off, like the wealthy getting to do things they want to do. This is about a higher standard of living, a better quality of life and longer lives for the average American.

Antoni: So when we're talking about recession, it's not a fun topic. It's nothing good. And it literally is just the economy shrinking. In terms of how we define it or what marks a recession, the basic understanding is that when the economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters, so three months, and then another three months, that's a recession. The reason that the White House has been making a lot of hay of, oh, that's not official definition, blah, blah, blah. Okay. I suppose there is no technical official definition, but I've taught plenty of economics courses. That was what we used in every single class. That's what you'll see in most, if not all economics textbooks. That's been the understanding for the last 100 years. So the idea that this is somehow new or not true, I dismiss that out of hand.

Antoni: I went back and I looked at every single time GDP was negative for two quarters, every time the economy shrank for two quarters, consecutive quarters, since World War II and every single one of those is today considered a recession. You do have an organization called the National Bureau of Economic Research, NBER. And what they will do is they will look back at the data, sometimes a year after the fact, and they will try to pinpoint the exact month when the economic expansion stopped and the contraction began. In other words, when we went from an expansion into a recession, and then they'll also do exactly the opposite, where they try to pinpoint the exact month where the recession ended. But to use a newly favorite phrase of this administration, that's backwards looking data. So it's not uncommon that they won't make that call until maybe a year after the recession is already underway.

Cordero: Okay. So talking specifically to our listeners right now, what are some of the ways everyday Americans can expect to feel this recession? Now that it's official, what should Americans be expecting?

Antoni: I'm not sure they even need to expect to feel anything. I think they've been feeling it. And I think it really speaks to the elitism of so many Washington bureaucrats when, for example, they are just shocked and surprised at how bad these inflation reports are. I mean, if you go around and ask the average American family, you would've known already just how bad things are. Because they would've told you that they don't have enough money for groceries and gasoline. They would've told you that they're having to choose between prescription medications and paying their rent. So I'm not even sure that these latest numbers really even make that much of a difference to the average American again, because they've been living it already. I don't think this is news to them and I'm not even sure there's anything different that they can do or should do at this point.

Cordero: So what causes a recession?

Antoni: Oh, that is a very good question. Let's see if I can ...

Cordero: I'm sure there's a number of things. Maybe in this instance.

Antoni: Sure, sure. I mean, in this instance, two things in particular really stand out. The first is that the government over the last 18 months, really over the last 2 years has spent, borrowed and printed trillions of dollars. And I'm sorry, but you can't do that with 6, 7, $8 trillion and expect there not to be severe negative consequences. And that has caused an incredible inflationary boom and inflation in a lot of ways is like alcoholism. Why does anyone go out and get drunk? It's because the good effect comes first and the bad effect comes later. If it started with the hangover, no one would over indulge but it doesn't. And with inflation, it starts out as what looks like an economic boom. But then over time you realize that it's just this funny money circulating around in the economy. And now all of a sudden prices start going up and up and up and up. And if you look at the stock market, for example, all of these investors are realizing that these gains that they've been seeing from corporations are not sustainable.

Antoni: And so now you're seeing corporations, for example, either miss earnings or if they're making their earnings, it's only because they were heavily revised down beforehand. So it's basically just a fancy way of saying things are nowhere near as good as we thought they were. And so now what we're seeing is as all these realities start to play out, essentially we're finding out that the economy is not in very good shape, and that people now don't have enough money, even though we all got literally trillions of dollars of extra cash, it just caused prices to go up. Now, we don't have money for all the things that we literally used to buy just 18 months ago. For the average family, for example, this has been the equivalent of losing about 68, it's 3,400 for the individual, but it's 6,800 for the average family.

Cordero: Wow. Yeah. That's no small chunk of change.

Antoni: No. I mean, when you think about it, that's more than some families spend on on vacations and food combined. Again, I think it really speaks to the elitism of Washington bureaucrats, that they have downplayed this and essentially ignored it for the last 18 months.

Cordero: Not only ignored it, but acted as if things are wonderful.

Antoni: Oh, right. Yeah, exactly. And again, this whole idea of we're going to call inflation all these different names, like we're going to call it transitory. At one point, they even said it was good for us because it meant the economy was growing, which is just baloney. And now it's all this nonsense of, oh, we're just going to redefine a recession as if somehow changing words is going to help the American family.

Cordero: Speaking of definitions, what is the difference between a recession and a depression?

Antoni: Sure. So we usually reserve the term depression for when we're talking about severe and protracted recessions. What we now call The Great Depression in the 1930s, that was a title that was previously reserved for a period from the 19th century where we had a severe banking panic. We had somewhere around, I want to say about a quarter of the banks in the country failed, which up until that time was a record, then it was superseded by The Great Depression of the 1930s. But then it took about five years for the economy to even get back to where it was before the crash.

Cordero: And is that considered a long time? This was my next question. How long do recessions typically last?

Antoni: Again, that's a very, very good question. And there's no good answer on it because it depends so heavily on government policies. So for example, there was actually very little difference in the root causes of the 1929 crash in the stock market and the economic downturn from the early 1980s, 1981. But one lasted a very short time and the other lasted more than a decade. And the difference was that in the case of the 1980s, you had a Federal Reserve that was focused on one thing, and one thing only, and that was stabilizing prices and driving a stake through the heart of inflation. And you had the Reagan administration, which wanted nothing more than to cut taxes and regulation and pursue, what we now call a supply side agenda.

Antoni: Conversely, during the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations, we had exactly the opposite. We had a Federal Reserve that essentially, it suffered from a lot of infighting between the people here in Washington, DC and the members in the New York branch of the Federal Reserve. So they were very inefficient in their actions. They allowed the money supply to shrink by something like a third in a very short period of time. And during that same period of time, the number of banks in the country collapsed by a third. On top of that, you had Hoover imposing taxes on trade, for example, tariffs on the largest scale that had ever been implemented. And then you had the Roosevelt administration pursuing more of the same, higher tax rates. He essentially tripled taxes.

Cordero: Yeah. So seeing that we've got three years left of the Biden administration who hasn't really been doing very much that makes any sense, how concerned are you?

Antoni: Very. Very concerned, particularly the fact that the Biden administration was in a very unique position in that it had such a tremendous benefit of hindsight because it could look back on the Trump administration, which did so many great things, but also had some pretty bad mistakes. And this administration, unfortunately, instead of learning from President Trump has decided to double down on any and all of the failures while ignoring all of the successes. And so in that sense, I have very little hope. Now as my friend, Larry Kudlow likes to say, ""The cavalry's coming so hang in there."" My only concern is how much longer can the average American hang in there.

Cordero: Yeah. Okay. In conclusion, it's a good place to end this here. In conclusion, first, what's your advice to Americans right now through this recession? And then second, what would be your advice to lawmakers and or those who have the power to pull us out?

Antoni: For Americans individually, I would say the same sound financial principles that apply any other times still apply now. Chiefly, you have to live within your means. Now that's gotten incredibly hard because of inflation. We oftentimes don't think of inflation this way, but it is a tax. It's a hidden tax because Congress didn't vote on it. The President didn't sign it, but it is still a tax. It's how the government is paying for the 6, 7, $8 trillion of unfunded spending that it issued over the last 2 years. So if you want to think of this as imagine you just got hit with a massive tax increase, now you need to change your life accordingly, that's essentially the same schema that you're trying to live by right now. So again, no good news on that front unfortunately, but it's just the reality of where we are. And we've already described how we got here. So then how do we get out of it?

Antoni: As the average American, that's going to take a tremendous amount of political pressure being exerted on those in power to get them to change course, because right now they have shown absolutely zero intent of changing course. In terms of what does that course change look like to answer your question for the people in power, the policy makers, what do they need to do? They need to reverse exactly the things that got us into this mess. So print, borrow and spend less money. I mean, full stop. We need to just take an axe, forget the scalpel. We need to take an axe to the leviathan that is the federal budget. And we need to put the political pressure necessary on the Federal Reserve to get them to get back to doing their job, which is stabilizing prices and ending inflation.

Cordero: Amen. Thank you for that. Thank you for this explainer on recession. We appreciate you and your expertise and we hope you'll join us again.

The economy, he said, was ""dead in the water when we got here. Virtually no jobs created.""

The White House told PolitiFact that by the end of the Trump administration, job creation had stalled out, and President Joe Biden's pandemic and economic recovery bill, the American Rescue Plan, accelerated economic expansion. Still, Klain’s framing was a significant exaggeration of reality.

The Biden administration has some justification for being pleased with its job-creation record. In the 15 months since Biden took office, month-over-month job gains have exceeded 424,000 in 14 of those months. (The only exception was in April 2021, when job gains totaled 263,000.)

Those gains have brought the national employment level to just under 99% of what it was just before the pandemic hit.

But the gains in employment didn’t turn on a dime when President Donald Trump left office and Biden took over. The recovery began under Trump.

In December 2020, the final full month before Biden took office, the employment level fell by 115,000, which has been the only absolute loss of jobs since April 2020, when the nation was suddenly plunged into lockdowns.

But that month is unrepresentative of the final months of Trump’s presidency. The final three months under Trump prior to that December loss produced gains of 919,000, 647,000, and 333,000 jobs, respectively. Those gains are substantial, not ""virtually no jobs created.""

Another key metric of economic health, gains in gross domestic product, also began their upswing before Biden took office.

Even setting aside the 33.8% increase in the third quarter of 2020, which was basically a reversal of the sudden -31.2% shrinkage the previous quarter, the fourth quarter of 2020, which came during Trump’s tenure, produced 4.5% growth.

PolitiFact ruling

Mostly False

Klain said the economy was ""dead in the water when we got here. Virtually no jobs created.""

The job creation record under Biden has been impressive, exceeding 424,000 in 14 out of the 15 months he’s been in office. However, the economy didn’t turn suddenly when he took office; it was already improving during the final months of Trump’s tenure.

While Trump’s last full month in office, December 2020, produced a loss in employment by 115,000, that was the exception. The final three months under Trump prior to that December loss produced job gains of 919,000, 647,000, and 333,000, respectively. Those gains are substantial, not ""virtually no jobs created.""

We rate the statement Mostly False."

Yes, this is adjusted for inflation, albeit using the gross domestic product price index, which hasn’t been rising quite as fast as the better-known consumer price index (7.6% year-over-year in the second quarter versus 8.6% for the CPI). And yes, I measure growth here using not GDP alone but the average of GDP and another metric tracked by the BEA, gross domestic income. In theory GDP and GDI should be equal, but they are estimated from different sources and so far this year are showing very different economic trajectories for the US.

With U.S. inflation at its highest level in 40 years, Wall Street crashing, and the United States on course for a deep recession, hell is the right description for where the world’s superpower is heading under the Biden presidency.

No wonder a new poll published by Fox News shows that just one third of Americans believe Biden should be re-elected for a second term. He is destroying the U.S. economy with his big-spending, reckless policies, and yet still has the cheek to condemn the British government over its original plans to cut taxes. He is the last person on Earth who should be offering economic advice to another country.

While chomping on an ice cream in Oregon over the weekend, the U.S. President took a sneering swipe at the notion of cutting the higher rate tax from 45 per cent to 40 per cent, calling it “a mistake” and equating it to simply “cutting taxes on the super wealthy”. Few people would expect him—a barely coherent man at the best of times—to understand the need to kickstart business and entrepreneurialism, but Biden seemed to delight in kicking the leader of America’s closest friend and ally at a time when the PM is on the ropes and fighting for her survival at home.

He knew full well the effects such comments would have on the domestic affairs of a close ally. It was unstatesmanlike and petulant. But most of all, against the backdrop of mounting economic turmoil at home, it was also shameless and hypocritical. Of course, the U.S. has a top rate federal tax of just 37 per cent.

>>> Liz Truss Advances Tax Cuts, Deregulation to Revive U.K.’s Economy

Biden’s big-government approach, pushing America’s national debt ever higher (now at a staggering $31 trillion), has forced the Federal Reserve to rapidly raise interest rates in an effort to cool down the U.S. economy, with far-reaching global implications, including for the U.K. The excessively strong dollar is forcing down currencies everywhere, exporting U.S. inflation and distorting balances of trade. The worldwide economic downturn is being led by the most Left-wing presidency in American history, with an insatiable appetite for spending taxpayer money, most recently under the ludicrous guise of the “Inflation Reduction Act”, to the tune of over $700 billion.

But don't expect a recognition of this reality. Rather, Biden and his lackies in Congress—particularly Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who seems to hold a special grudge against the British—will continue to snipe at London from across the pond. It forms part of a track record: look at how they have behaved over the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, with the White House and Congressional Democrats issuing thinly-veiled threats at Downing Street if it dared to ditch the flawed agreement. Biden thinks nothing of menacing the British if he thinks it will play well domestically to the protectionist lobby, while appeasing Ireland and the European Union.

It seems, though, that their animosity towards Liz Truss runs deeper still. They view her as a dangerous free-marketer, a radical Thatcherite tax-cutter, and also a possible inspiration for their political adversaries. Her rightful ambition for growth runs contrary to the stay-in-your-lane, managed decline of the International Monetary Fund and other liberal institutions in Washington D.C. From their viewpoint, Truss had to have her wings clipped, and Biden’s team have done their best to help make that happen.

In the face of such opposition, Liz Truss should stand her ground and explain the need for more growth, not only in Britain but across the West. Moreover, Joe Biden should be told to mind his own business, and back off."
275,Biden Launches Indo-Pacific Economic Framework - Voice of America - VOA News,Biden Launches Indo-Pacific Economic Framework  Voice of America - VOA News,"Mon, 23 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYmlkZW4tbGF1bmNoZXMtaW5kby1wYWNpZmljLWVjb25vbWljLWZyYW1ld29yay0vNjU4NTE2MC5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2JpZGVuLWxhdW5jaGVzLWluZG8tcGFjaWZpYy1lY29ub21pYy1mcmFtZXdvcmstLzY1ODUxNjAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Voice of America - VOA News,"U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Monday the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which includes a dozen Indo-Pacific countries and is designed to provide a counterweight against Chinese economic clout in the region.

“The future of the 21st Century economy is going to largely be written in the Indo-Pacific — in our region,” Biden said during IPEF’s launch event. “We’re writing the new rules.”

The countries joining the launch are Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Biden was joined in person by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the launch event in Tokyo, and virtually by the others.

IPEF is seen as a key step in the U.S. effort to re-engage Indo-Pacific nations on trade more than five years after the U.S. withdrew from a regional comprehensive trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership known as TPP.

“The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is part of President Biden’s commitment to putting American families and workers in the center of economic and foreign policy, while strengthening our ties with allies and partners for the purpose of increasing shared prosperity and for the purpose of defining the coming decades for technological innovation in the global economy,” U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters Sunday.

The group represents 40% of the world GDP, Sullivan said, adding that other countries could join in the future.

There are no market access or tariff reduction provisions in the framework, as there are in previous free trade agreements — trade incentives that countries in the region desire. Even as Japan said it welcomes IPEF, it is signaling that it wants more.

“Japan welcomes the launch of the Indo-Pacific economic framework, IPEF, by President Biden and will participate and cooperate in this initiative,” said Kishida in his joint press conference with Biden earlier Monday. “Regarding the TPP, we are truly hoping for a return of the United States.”

Former President Barack Obama in 2016 signed on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Former President Donald Trump withdrew from it a year later and the deal eventually became CPTPP — an 11-country bloc that now constitutes one of the largest free-trade areas in the world.

IPEF is centered around four “pillars” — Connected Economy, Resilient Economy, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy. Signees can pick and choose among the four. The design, Sullivan said, has “flexibility” and “creativity” to accommodate the “diverse range of countries.”

Administration officials are touting the initiative as “the most significant international economic engagement that the United States has ever had in this region.” Its launch “marks an important turning point in restoring U.S. economic leadership in the region and presenting Indo-Pacific countries alternatives to China’s approach to these critical issues,” Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo told reporters.

However, beyond the brief fact sheet released by the White House, much is still unknown about the initiative that represents the economic leg of Washington’s broader Indo-Pacific Strategy.

Deborah Elms, the founder and executive director of the Asian Trade Centre and the president of the Asia Business Trade Association said IPEF “represents a leap into the unknown, with limited understanding of how any new IPEF commitments might interact with existing pledges.”

“More important for many current governments is what is the level of commitment required of members? How many changes might be required at the domestic level? In exchange for what types of possible economic benefits?” Elms told VOA.

Administration officials say more will be revealed as countries engage deeper in negotiations.

Taiwan not included

Taiwan is not part of the initial launch, despite the fact that Taipei is interested and its inclusion is supported by a bipartisan group of 52 U.S. senators.

The IPEF launch document “was quite clear in referencing threats from China,” Elms said. “If you add Taiwan to the list of IPEF participants, it could be even harder to hold onto current signatories for the IPEF. China is the largest economic partner for all the members taking part in IPEF.”

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said she is in discussion with her Taipei counterpart to pursue a deeper bilateral engagement on trade.

“I have committed that our teams be in touch and that we'll be in touch in the next couple of weeks,” she told reporters. “So, please stay tuned for that.”

Ahead of the IPEF launch, Beijing criticized the U.S. effort, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi saying the strategy is “doomed to fail.”

Lack of market access

The biggest criticism of the IPEF is its lack of tariff reduction or other provisions leading to opening access to the U.S. market — making it less attractive in a region that has existing regional free trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

“You’re right — it is not a traditional free trade agreement,” Sullivan told VOA. “And that’s a good thing. It is a modern negotiation designed to deal with modern challenges.”

Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, told VOA that while the IPEF is not a comprehensive trade deal, there is the potential for real economic gains.

“In particular, IPEF’s trade dialogue presents a unique opportunity to offer a different path on digital in contrast to the one countries like China and Russia are following,” Colvin said. “We also hope to see ambitious supply chain commitments that could facilitate trade and ease customs bottlenecks in the region.”

U.S. officials point out that, with 60% of the world’s population, the Indo-Pacific is projected to be the largest contributor to global growth over the next 30 years. According to the White House, U.S. foreign direct investment in the Indo-Pacific region totaled more than $969 billion in 2020 and has nearly doubled in the last decade.

As the country gears up for midterm elections that will determine who controls Congress, how people view the country’s economic outlook seems to be shaped not just by confusing or conflicting indicators, but also by politics.

A majority of Democrats and Biden’s 2020 voters don’t see a recession; everybody else seems to disagree. Most Republicans and independents say U.S. economic growth has slumped, and that impression holds for a majority of people in nearly every other demographic group. Comparable levels of economic pessimism haven’t been seen since March 2013 under the Obama administration, as employers cut back on employee health benefits as parts of the Affordable Care Act began to take effect and the nation’s GDP was lackluster.

In recent months, people likely still wince from the sting of historic inflation, the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates and the sluggish stock market – all of which raised grave concerns not so long ago about how much more the nation’s economy could take.

There’s also striking evidence to combat that pessimism. The nation’s job market has recovered nearly 17 million jobs lost during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless rate hovers above 3 percent – down from a record high of 14.7 percent in April 2020. Americans who earn the smallest paychecks saw wage growth that, for many, offset higher costs of living. And COVID relief in the forms of child tax credits, eviction moratoriums and aid went to people directly, rather than only to businesses, said Darrick Hamilton, professor of economics and urban policy at the New School for Social Research.

Unlike the days of the Great Recession, when policymakers bailed out banks and businesses as people lost their homes and jobs, Hamilton noted that money has gone “directly to people” to ease pandemic-driven losses. But inflation has reshaped how people perceive those gains. They feel their dollar doesn’t stretch as far as it once did when they buy groceries or go to pay their bills.

This didn’t happen overnight, Hamilton explained, but after decades of racist and classist policies. “The most wealthy amongst us has accrued a lion’s share of whatever productivity gains are in the economy,” he said. “It manifests in a level of disparity we haven’t seen since the Gilded Age that preempted the Great Depression.”

What matters to voters now

In this latest poll, 30 percent of Americans said inflation would be their priority when they vote in November. Republicans, independents and white men who did not graduate from college are most likely to name it as their top issue.

Falling gas prices suggest inflation may be easing and, overall, economic worries have softened since July, when 37 percent of U.S. adults ranked price hikes as their biggest voting issue. But significant relief may not arrive or change the narrative before elections in two months.

The economy is also not the only priority for voters.

One out of five Americans — 22 percent — say abortion is of utmost importance when they vote in the midterms. That includes 35 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of white women who graduated from college.

What’s more, six out of 10 Americans said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade makes them more likely to vote this fall. Statistically, that attitude hasn’t faltered since shortly after the court issued its final opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson in June.

Overall, another 13 percent of Americans said health care will be top of mind for them.

One out of five Democrats said they are motivated by the Jan. 6 committee hearings that are investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol and the role former President Donald Trump and his administration played in that deadly day. Just as many Republicans are concerned about immigration.

Who’s in charge here?

Confidence in President Joe Biden’s economic leadership has fallen since July 2021, according to this latest Marist poll. Fifty-seven percent of U.S. adults say his decisions weaken the economy, including nearly all Republicans, 63 percent of independents and 76 percent of white people who didn’t graduate from college. That’s worse for Biden by 12 percentage points compared to over a year ago.

Approval of Biden overall has improved slightly at 41 percent, inching up 3 percentage points in a few weeks.

WATCH: How Democrats coalesced around the Inflation Reduction Act

If Americans feel Biden is not serving them well on pocketbook issues, is anyone doing better? Thirty-nine percent of the public thinks Republicans do a good job of dealing with the economy. Fewer Americans — 26 percent — felt the same way about Democrats. One out of five Americans said neither party does a good job of leading on economic issues.

While there is much in history to suggest that Democrats could suffer at the ballot box, feelings about a president’s economic stewardship doesn’t always dictate fate. In 2018, Americans felt more optimistic about the economy under Trump, who received relatively high approval for his economic leadership, according to Marist polling data. But as Amy Walter, publisher and editor of the Cook Political Report, said, “Many of those same voters ended up supporting Democrats” because they did not like how Trump behaved or conducted himself as president.

Today, a majority of Americans feel the country is already in a recession and trust Republicans more than Democrats to steer the nation’s economy back toward growth, Walter said. And yet, Democrats still hold a tenuous lead on the generic ballot.

Support for Democrats has held steady at 48 percent since earlier this summer, but Republicans are gaining momentum. If the November elections were held today, 44 percent of national registered voters said they would vote for Republicans, up three percentage points since June.

With Democrats touting their accomplishments, from passing major legislation to lower prescription drug costs to helping families during the pandemic, Walter said the midterms are far from over: “The question is: Do voters give them credit for that? Or do they say, ‘It’s not enough, and we think Republicans can do better’?”

PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey Aug. 29 – Sept. 1 that polled 1,236 U.S. adults (margin of error of 4.1 percentage points) and 1,151 registered voters (margin of error of 4.3 percentage points)."

Biden begins his latest attempt to change the economic narrative with an obligatory moment of empathy with the plight of the American people, a classic “lunch bucket Joe” talking point he’s been dishing out for decades.

He then quickly pivots and sets out down a familiar path of what can only be described as a series of gratuitous claims. Topping the list of “accomplishments” is what he calls “the most robust recovery in modern history,” brushing off record high inflation, skyrocketing gas and food prices and abysmal poll numbers like flies at a backyard barbecue.

He claims that he engineered the “fastest decline in unemployment on record,” conveniently forgetting that the country is still 1.19 million jobs short of where we were prior to the pandemic. Bringing back jobs isn’t quite the same as creating new ones, which a growing economy needs.

But Biden doesn’t stop there. To justify his out-of-sync economy, he simply tries to redefine the whole idea of growth, telling people to see lower job-creation numbers in the months ahead — going from 500,000 jobs a month to a more reasonable 150,000 jobs a month — as a positive. But not to worry, he says, fewer jobs isn’t a “cause for concern.”

Biden actually claims that slower job creation is a “sign that we are successfully moving into the next phase of recovery,” the Biden administration’s transition economy. Translation: Lower your economic expectations for the future and accept the new normal.

Only in Biden’s world is slower job creation a good thing.

Biden does acknowledge that inflation is still a problem. He goes on to outline a new three-point plan to deliver “stable, steady growth.” That, with the “right policies,” will bring down inflation. In part one, Biden tosses the hot potato of inflation where he says it belongs — with the Federal Reserve. Not my responsibility, says this president, and he promises not to interfere with the Fed. Less than 24 hours after his op-ed appeared, the president met with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Part two of his plan focuses on what he says is making “things more affordable for families during this moment of economic uncertainty and to boost the productive capacity of our economy over time.” Wait. What happened to his historic economic recovery?

As he and his spokespeople have done many times before, Biden blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for rising gas prices while boasting that he led the “largest release from global oil reserves in history.” To date, this has had no impact on the price of crude or gas at the pump. Once again, Biden calls on Congress to pass his clean energy tax credits and investments, which he claims would save the average American family $500 a year and get us out from under the thumb of energy “autocrats.”

Given the impact of Biden’s green energy policies on energy inflation so far, it’s not likely anyone but the Green New Deal crowd is going to buy that statement. He follows up with a laundry list of promises on everything from the cost of drugs to the cost of child and elder care but offers few solutions to any of the problems he cites.

Finally, in the third part of his plan, Biden returns to his most deceptive claim of all — that it is his policies that are responsible for the projected $1.7 trillion decrease in the deficit this year.

Here’s the actual breakdown, according to the Congressional Budget Office:

“In CBO’s projections, total federal outlays decrease by $1.0 trillion in 2022. The decline in 2022 is dominated by a $1.1 trillion drop in estimated mandatory spending — the result of sharply lower pandemic-related spending — to $3.7 trillion this year.”

In English, that means most of the deficit decrease has nothing to do with Biden or his policies and everything to do with winding down COVID-19 relief expenditures and increased revenues.

The CBO projects that overall revenues as a percentage of GDP this fiscal year will hit 19.6 percent — the highest since 2000 (20 percent). Looking at projected income tax revenues as a percentage of GDP, CBO says that, at 10.6 percent, “that total is expected to be the highest amount of individual income tax receipts recorded since 1913, when ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment authorized the federal government to begin collecting income taxes.”

That increase wasn’t Biden’s doing either. That credit belongs to the 2017 tax cuts that produced one of the strongest economies in recent memory and are delivering the revenues helping to cushion the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy.

So, are people buying Biden’s claim that his economic and vaccination plans brought about “the most robust recovery in modern history” or his plans for a new transition economy? Are they giving his economic policies credit or blame for the current state of the U.S. economy?

In the May 25-26 Winning the Issues survey (WTI), people were asked whether they thought his economic policies were correct or incorrect. By a 35 percent (correct) to 51 percent (incorrect) margin, people said “Bidenomics” were incorrect. Among independents, the margin was worse, at 23 percent correct, 52 percent incorrect.

The survey also tested Biden’s job approval on handling inflation. Overall, 33 percent of voters approved of how Biden is handling inflation, while 59 percent disapproved. The margin with independents was a staggering 17 percent approved, 67 percent disapproved.

The mistake the Biden team is making is not uncommon in the political sphere on both sides of the aisle. It believes that winning is all about the messaging, not outcomes.

If Biden’s op-ed this week or almost any of his economic statements over the past six months are any indication, this White House is operating under the illusion that its problem lies with the narrative, not the reality that its policies are more likely to make inflation worse, not better.

Words don’t always work, and neither do bad policies that are out of sync with most Americans. A change in direction might help, but that would require a different kind of transition than the one Biden is peddling this week — a transition to new ideas.

Not likely.

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above.

Biden said because of the progress his administration has made on the economy, “Americans can tackle inflation from a position of strength.”

U.S. employers added 390,000 jobs in May, extending a streak of solid hiring that has bolstered an economy under pressure from high inflation and rising interest rates.

Last month’s gain reflects a resilient job market that has so far shrugged off concerns that the economy will weaken in the coming months as the Federal Reserve steadily raises interest rates to fight inflation. The unemployment rate remained a low 3.6 percent in May, just above a half-century low, the Labor Department said Friday.

“We’ve laid an economic foundation that’s historically strong, and now we’re moving forward to a new moment where we can build on that foundation, build a future of stable, steady growth so we can bring down inflation without sacrificing all the historic gains we’ve made,” Biden said from his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

The job growth in May was high enough to keep the Fed on track to pursue what’s likely to be the fastest series of rate hikes in more than 30 years. Stock market futures fell Friday after the government released the jobs report, reflecting that concern.

Businesses in many industries remain desperate to hire because their customers have kept spending freely despite intensifying concerns about high inflation. Americans’ finances have been buoyed by rising pay and an unusually large pile of savings that were accumulated during the pandemic, particularly by higher-income households.

Workers, in general, are enjoying nearly unprecedented bargaining power. The number of people who are quitting jobs, typically for better positions at higher pay, has been at or near a record high for six months.

In May, Friday’s jobs report showed, more Americans came off the sidelines of the workforce and found jobs, a sign that rising wages and plentiful opportunities are encouraging people to look for work. Rising prices might also have led some to take jobs: The number of people ages 55 or over who are working rose last month, suggesting that some older Americans are “unretiring” after leaving their jobs — or being laid off — during the pandemic and its aftermath.

Average hourly wages rose 10 cents in May to $31.95, the government said, a solid gain but not enough to keep up with inflation. Compared with 12 months earlier, hourly pay climbed 5.2 percent, down from a 5.5 percent year-over-year gain in April and the second straight drop. More moderate pay raises could ease inflationary pressures in the economy and help sustain growth.

Nearly every large industry added workers in May. One major exception was retail, which shed nearly 61,000 positions. Some large retailers, including Walmart and Target, have reported disappointing sales and earnings. Last month, Walmart said it had over-hired and then reduced its head count through attrition.

Construction companies added 36,000 jobs, a hopeful sign for Americans who have bought new homes that aren’t yet built because of labor and parts shortages. Shipping and warehousing companies, still struggling to keep up with growing online commerce, added 47,000 jobs. Restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues hired 84,000.

The strength of the job market is itself contributing to inflationary pressures. With wages rising across the economy, companies are passing on at least some of their increased labor costs to their customers in the form of higher prices. The costs of food, gas, rent and other items – which fall disproportionately on lower-income households — are accelerating at nearly the fastest pace in 40 years.

Inflation had begun surging last year as spiking demand for cars, furniture, electronic equipment and other physical goods collided with overwhelmed supply chains and parts shortages. More recently, prices for such services as airline tickets, hotel rooms and restaurant meals have jumped as Americans have shifted more of their spending to those areas.

To try to cool spending and slow inflation, the Fed last month raised its short-term rate by a half-point, its biggest hike since 2000, to a range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Two additional half-point rate increases are expected this month and in July. And some Fed officials have suggested in recent speeches that if inflation doesn’t show signs of slowing, they could implement yet another half-point increase in September.

The Fed’s moves have already sharply elevated mortgage rates and contributed to drops in sales of new and existing homes. The rate hikes have also magnified borrowing costs for businesses, which may respond by reducing their investment in new buildings and equipment, slowing growth in the process."

On inflation’s effects at home … “The truth is that President Biden’s economic policies have led to the worst inflationary effects in our economy in 40 years. That means that the average person in our country is experiencing an invisible tax that is eroding their spending power. That means that our seniors who are on a fixed income have to find a way to ration either their health care or their medicine, their energy, or food. It means that people who are growing up in households like the one I grew up in [are] now having to make harder decisions than they’ve ever had to make. That’s wrong.”

On inflation’s global effects … “This feels like the Carter era. When you think about the explosive price in gas, when you think about what it costs to heat or cool your home if you’re in South Carolina, it is drastic. But more importantly, when you look at the global effect, you remember the days when Venezuela was at a 900 percent inflationary effect because of the crushing decisions of their government. … The truth is that the whole globe responds to the type of economic decisions that we make here at home. That’s why our global leadership economically matters so much.

“We should be forcing decisions here at home like: Why not restart our own energy economy, creating six-figure jobs here at home? Why not continue the conversation around the Keystone XL Pipeline? … Why not use Opportunity Zones to attract insourcing back into America?”

On COVID restrictions hurting the economy … “COVID is endemic within our community at this point, not an epidemic as I see it. So what we need to do is continue to make the adjustments that we’re seeing around the country. The good news is at home in South Carolina, our unemployment rate is 3.4 percent statewide … So the good news is we’re proving that we can handle the COVID challenges in a right-to-work environment. I’d recommend that we export South Carolina values and the dignity of work throughout the rest of the country, especially places like New York and California.”

In all that time, a rising tide did not lift all boats and prosperity never managed to trickle down. A study by the RAND Corporation found that over the past 45 years, $50 trillion was redistributed upward from the bottom 90 percent of earners to the top 1 percent. Even with that eye-watering sum in their hands, the wealthiest 1 percent failed to deliver on the neoliberal promise of supercharged growth. A 2014 report from the OECD estimated that rising inequality knocked as much as nine points off U.S. gross domestic product growth over the previous two decades alone—more than $2 trillion a year in lost economic activity.

Biden ran for office on a different vision. In his campaign kick-off speech in a union hall in Pittsburgh, Biden castigated corporations for using tax breaks to buy back their stocks and shipping jobs overseas while “squeezing the life out of workers.” He declared that his major priority was to rebuild the middle class, “the backbone of America.”

Once in office he set out to do that, appointing an economic team who shared his vision—as members of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers wrote in a 2021 issue brief, Biden’s “proposed policies reflect the empirical evidence that a strong economy depends on a solid foundation of public investment, and that investments in workers, families, and communities can pay off for decades to come.”"

After a year marked by Democrats’ internal dysfunction, Congress has over the last few weeks suddenly delivered a raft of legislation that will help form the core of President Biden’s economic record before lawmakers face voters in the 2022 midterm elections. Beyond the economic rescue package and bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year, Congress this month alone also approved a $280 billion measure to expand veterans health care, a $280 billion law to counter China’s economic rise, and the Inflation Reduction Act centered on addressing the climate crisis, lowering health-care costs and raising taxes on large corporations.

The recent wins, in particular, have sharpened the Biden administration’s imprint on the U.S. economy. His presidency combines some traditional features of Democratic policymaking — such as pursuing higher taxes and expanded access to health care — with a new focus on reviving domestic industry through targeted investment, supporting American labor, and cracking down on monopolistic firms through a heavier emphasis on antitrust enforcement.

The outset of Biden’s term has been defined by pitched battles over short-term economic circumstances: The president has defended his 2021 rescue plan as leading to the biggest single-year jobs boom in American history, while critics have assailed that same policy for exacerbating the fastest price increases in four decades. The latest string of legislative victories, however, turn the battle over “Bidenomics” into one over the long-term trajectory of the nation’s tax code, energy sector and other structural parts of the nation’s economy, although the menace of inflation continues to dominate even these debates.

“There’s a much greater comfort with industrial policy, ‘Buy America’ over engaging internationally, pro-union policy and pro-competition policy,” said Jason Furman, who served as a senior economist in the Obama administration. “A number of those things were in Obama, but there’s more of it and it’s more central to Biden.”

White House officials say the new legislation aimed at expanding America’s production capacity — with hundreds of billions of dollars invested in sectors like infrastructure, semiconductors and renewable energy — will ensure that the broader economy continues to grow for years to come. Those economic gains will then be translated to workers, they say, through their efforts to run a tight labor market spurred by the rescue plan, which means workers have the bargaining power to ensure that the benefits are broadly felt.

“When it comes to establishing a lasting legacy in terms of existentially necessary economic transformation, history may well put President Biden in the same sentence as FDR and LBJ,” said Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, in an interview, referring to Democratic presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, who ushered in major changes to the American economy such as Social Security and Medicare. “And President Biden gets an asterisk, because he’s building this legacy within an environment of intense partisanship and a razor-sharp majority.”

Still, so far at least, Biden’s economic reputation has been overwhelmingly defined by one weakness: inflation. Biden’s first major bill, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, supercharged economic demand, which many economists have said led to the fastest price increases in America in decades.

Higher prices for food, housing and energy, while easing, have weighed on Americans’ budgets, knocking out the benefits of broad-based wage gains. Polling has consistently shown the public is broadly furious over high prices, and it remains unclear whether the sum of his legislative accomplishments can overcome that frustration.

The dangers to the present economy threaten to upend the Biden administration’s claims of progress and long-term transformation. If the Federal Reserve moves too quickly to combat inflation, unemployment could spike and the economy could reenter a recession. But failure to arrest inflation would also spell political and economic disaster for the administration.

“Inflation hits everyone everywhere with everything — and that’s just damning for the administration. Unless or until they fix that, not much else will matter,” said Frank Luntz, a pollster and analyst. Luntz said inflation outranked all issues for voters, even when guns and abortion dominated the news. “Nothing else comes close, because nothing affects more people in more places in more communities across the entire country.”

The White House is also left to grapple with the failure of key parts of Biden’s campaign promises. Democrats in 2020 ran on large-scale changes to the country’s safety net, as Biden campaigned on creating a new “care economy” with new programs in child care, paid family leave and eldercare.

Those aspirations have largely died in Congress, despite the administration’s efforts. Some analysts say Biden’s presidency is on pace to do less to expand the welfare state than former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who both pushed through more significant changes to the U.S. health-care system. The White House approved a one-year expansion of the child tax credit in its 2021 rescue plan as the centerpiece of its plan to reduce child poverty, hoping that would build popular support for the program to ensure its continued extension. But that measure expired at the end of last year with little chance of being renewed soon.

“The administration misperceived what the covid crisis could do for big policy change, and misperceived what the feedback effects would be of the policies they implemented for a year,” said Josh McCabe, historian of welfare policy and a senior analyst at the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank. “They started out with a very ambitious agenda, thinking there was a policy window — but they turned out to be completely wrong.”

Instead, the Biden economic legacy will largely be the product of negotiations of Congress, which were determined more by Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) — Democrats’ 50th vote in Congress — than the White House. Many of the policies that centrist Democrats agreed to support had been backed by President Donald Trump, as well. Trump emphasized the need for action on prescription drugs, reviving American manufacturing, and countering China’s rise — all of which are now key pieces of the Biden agenda. Biden has also largely maintained the controversial tariffs Trump imposed on China, even though some economists have said removing them would help alleviate inflation.

“Conceptually, there’s a lot of overlap with President Trump’s agenda and the agenda of parts of the Republican Party,” said Stephen Miran, who served as a Treasury Department official during the Trump administration and is the co-founder of Amberwave Partners, an investment fund.

In an interview with The Post, White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said Biden “achieved some of the most important bipartisan accomplishments in decades — including what the former president has called for but has not been able to get done.”

But the White House has also taken actions criticized by corporate America in major reversals from the direction of the Trump presidency. Biden has, for instance, taken a broad approach to cracking down on outsize corporate power, reflecting an emerging Democratic consensus that a handful of megafirms have stifled competition in the U.S. economy. Biden appointed an antitrust hawk to lead the Federal Trade Commission, and his Department of Justice is in the process of revising guidelines for large corporate mergers. The White House has taken steps to impose greater oversight over the shipping industry, which was deregulated under Clinton, through new legislation cracking down on higher international ocean shipping costs. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a tax on the few dozen shipping firms with more than $1 billion in annual profits.

“It’s a huge change from the Reagan consensus that carried through the Obama administration,” said Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a think tank that supports aggressive antitrust policy.

Biden has also overseen an economic recovery markedly different from that of Obama, who struggled with the sluggish pace of job and wage gains in the aftermath of the Great Recession. While the stimulus rescue plan exacerbated inflation, it also averted the deep labor market scarring that occurred after the last recession. These robust gains form the centerpiece of Biden’s efforts to boost worker power, in part because Congress defeated efforts to deliver on Biden’s campaign promises to raise the minimum wage and make it far easier for workers to unionize.

By increasing demand for workers, resulting in strong job creation and record numbers of job openings, workers have ended up with more leverage in the workplace to negotiate higher pay and benefits. (Biden has also taken symbolic actions to boost union efforts, such as inviting Amazon labor leaders to the White House.)

“We are not facing the long-term damage to workers that we did previously,” said Claudia Sahm, an economist who worked at the Federal Reserve. “I do not see labor institutions as having changed, but we have seen worker bargaining power come back.”

Biden’s ultimate economic legacy may come down to the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act, which finally passed after months of difficult negotiations without any GOP votes. The legislation is the largest climate bill ever passed, and Democrats are hoping it also brings back U.S. manufacturing by reviving the nation’s industrial base, aiming to repair supply chains exposed as brittle by the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic.

Beyond the bill’s energy savings, its most direct benefit for consumers may be the prescription drug reforms that would require Medicare to negotiate the prices of some of the country’s most expensive drugs. That measure would take until 2026 to take effect — after this year’s midterms and the 2024 presidential election — leaving unclear how much voters will feel it."

Elvira Nabiullina, the longtime governor of the Russian Central Bank was Europe’s 2017 “Central Banker of the Year,” according to the Banker magazine. Russia’s treasury recoups about twenty per cent of its G.D.P. as tax revenue, a figure far exceeding most other petrostates and on par with the United States. Moscow enjoys both fiscal and trade surpluses, and its debt load is low. Every attempt to make sense of Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine has seemed obscured in an incense haze of past tsars, imperial designs, and Russian military history. But, to practitioners of economic statecraft, the situation is as clear as looking in a mirror. “It’s a pretty solid, talented group of technocrats there,” one senior Biden Administration official told me, of Russia’s central bankers. In any economic crisis, “we expected that they would respond smartly.”

What modern Russian economists have done is assemble an immense stockpile of foreign currency and gold: six hundred and thirty billion dollars, thirteen per cent of it in renminbi, twenty-two per cent of it in gold, and much of the balance in the major currencies of the economic West—euros, dollars, yen, pounds. The Russian currency stockpile eventually grew so vast that some Western financial analysts described it as “Fortress Russia”—if Russia were to be isolated in the event of a war, and the value of the ruble were to degrade, the foreign currencies could be used to stabilize the Russian economy and prevent a crisis. In the medium term, at least, these reserves seemed to provide an economic buffer for Putin. Even if Europe were to cut off all imports of Russian energy, depriving Moscow of its main source of revenue, one analyst at the Atlantic Council told the Times, the reserves would allow Moscow to fill the gap for “several years.”

The proficiency of the Russian bankers posed a particular challenge to their Western counterparts. Authoritarian regimes are supposed to have the advantage of long-term planning, since their policies do not need to change with elections. If Russia, like China, was managing its economy as expertly as we could, then where was the advantage? When the G-7 gathered in Cornwall, in June, 2021, for its first in-person summit since the pandemic, President Biden tried to summon a sense of renewed post-Trump urgency, of liberal democracies uniting against authoritarianism, but there were still more basic doubts about the efficacy of the Western system. “We’ve been reflecting a lot on this discussion in the G-7, on how strong are democracies,” a senior E.U. official told me. “Sometimes, the feeling is that democracies are having a bit more challenges—sometimes, they’re cumbersome, and slower.”

Among the American delegation in the room was a figure who surely flew below the radar of Russian intelligence: a forty-six-year-old North Carolinian named Daleep Singh, who had recently been appointed as Biden’s deputy national-security adviser for international economics. Singh, who spent part of his early career at Goldman Sachs, had made his name as a market technician, having joined the markets room in the Obama Treasury Department, and then spent part of the Trump years as the vice-president for markets at the New York Fed. Singh had watched, with some skepticism, the growing esteem in which Russia was held on Wall Street, which hinged on the idea of its economic foresight. “I grew up in financial markets. I often hear from people in financial markets,” Singh told me last week. “And one of the myths I felt like they held—and it was kind of perpetrated by the Russian government—was that it had built an economic fortress around its economy, and that it was due to years and years of genius planning by Putin himself.”

The two great surprises of the first month of the war have been the strength of the Ukrainian resistance and the severity of the Western sanctions, which seem likely to prevent Russia from accessing its currency reserves. The effects of economic sanctions are just now beginning to be seen, but Sergei Guriev, a professor of economics at Sciences Po, in Paris, told me that he foresaw “Soviet stagnation, Soviet decline.” (There was a slight Soviet ambience this week, as viral videos showed Russians fighting over sugar in grocery stores, and a Russian government minister appeared on television to urge the public not to panic-buy essentials such as buckwheat.) If Russia’s misestimation of the Ukrainians was psychological, then its misestimation of Western sanctions was political and technical. The sanctions have a complex architecture—based on rules, economic levers, and the responses of Western companies and investors—but they also have an architect, a former Obama official told me. “The architect of these sanctions was Daleep Singh.”

Singh’s generation of liberals—those who graduated college around the time of 9/11—have returned to power from a very tense, four-year hiatus with two entangled challenges: to embody a return to sober order, after the mania of Donald Trump, and to pursue a bolder and more expansive response to the pressures of inequality and authoritarianism, problems that have come to seem far more acute since the Obama years. Singh himself has a slight throwback quality, to the manner of late-twentieth-century American liberalism—the casual language and formal suits, the Sorkinesque quickness, the tendency to talk about human mechanisms with the simplicity of economic graphs. When it came to sanctions, he had a characteristic mission: to expand on an Obama-era project. Run that scene again, but different this time.

The precedent had taken place in 2014, in the debate about how to sanction Russia after its invasion of Crimea. Beyond freezing the assets of certain oligarchs close to Putin, the Obama Administration designed its sanctions to keep a few large and influential Russian corporations (mostly banks and energy companies) from accessing Western debt. The choice was designed to exploit a specific vulnerability, one that Singh helped identify: in 2014, many of the most important Russian entities were in the midst of a debt binge, and were overexposed. In terms of potential severity, Edward Fishman, a leading Obama Administration sanctions official, told me that the 2014 sanctions had been a “two out of ten.” Still, combined with a bigger bust in the oil market, they caused some trouble. The Russian economy, which had been growing for several years, contracted in 2015. The ruble crashed, and inflation surpassed twelve per cent in the year after the invasion. And yet Putin’s power was largely undisturbed. If anything, the sanctions’ larger effect was to convince the Kremlin that it needed to build its stockpile. “We saw Russia in economic and fiscal vulnerability,” the senior Biden Administration official said. “We saw Russia respond with the central-bank tool, really kind of building up their reserves with the idea that if the U.S. comes after us again, we’ll need an even stronger central-bank backstop.”

Singh started thinking seriously about potential sanctions on Russia in early November, when U.S. intelligence assessments began to warn of a likely invasion of Ukraine. “We put our heads together and figured out where do we have strengths and where do our strengths intersect with Russian vulnerability—where is there an asymmetry,” Singh told me. One area was Russia’s access to Western technologies, such as microchips and software. Another potential vulnerability was the dependence of Russian banks on capital from overseas. Each of these moves exploited certain American advantages, but they did nothing to undermine the reserves Putin had built to make the Russian economy “sanction-proof.” So Singh turned to another point of asymmetry: the currency trade. “It’s true that the global economy has gotten increasingly multipolar over time—you could see that just as a percentage of world G.D.P.,” Singh said. But, when it came to the currency in which countries bought and sold things, saved money, and borrowed money, the dollar’s share was between sixty and eighty per cent. In the world of global finance, Singh said, “the dollar is still the operating system.”

As a technical matter, sanctioning a central bank was within the scope of American expertise: the U.S. developed central-bank sanctions as a centerpiece of its economic war with Iran, and there had been some preliminary discussions of sanctioning the Russian Central Bank in 2014. The real obstacle was diplomatic. The more countries that coöperated, the more comprehensive the sanction—if Moscow could simply sell its assets to German, Swiss, or Japanese banks, a U.S. embargo on Putin’s foreign-exchange fortress would lose much of its impact. Historically, European leaders, more dependent on Russian energy and more entangled with the Russian economy, had little appetite for sanctioning Moscow. “It was important to float this at the right moment,” a senior Biden Administration official told me. “We almost had to wait until there was an emotional valence.”

In the meantime, coöperation with overseas allies had begun. Singh spoke each week with his G-7 counterparts, and his conversations with Bjoern Seibert, the head of the cabinet for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, eventually increased to several times each day. A team from the U.S., which included officials from the Department of Commerce, spent a week in Brussels, the senior E.U. official said, to work through the details on the control of high-tech exports. U.S. intelligence had also made the strategic decision to speed up the process through which it shared intelligence with NATO so that the Western allies were “operating from a similar set of facts,” a U.S. official told The New Yorker, in February. In Europe, this caught attention. “We’ve worked with the U.S. on ISIS and other things, and we’ve seen intelligence-sharing,” the senior E.U. official told me. “But never to this extent.”

If U.S. intelligence seemed especially sure that Russia would invade Ukraine, Moscow’s businessmen seemed less convinced. In prior crises, the senior Biden Administration official told me, Russian individuals and companies pulled back assets, investing in gold or foreign currency, bracing. “That was not something that happened in the immediate run-up to this,” the Administration official said. “Big state banks, big oligarchs—we weren’t seeing a lot of pullback. Frankly, I think there was this kind of disbelief, including by much of the Moscow business community, that this could actually come to materialize.”

On February 24th, the Russian invasion of Ukraine began—columns moving ominously across the border, rockets firing into central Kharkiv, a phalanx of helicopters and paratroopers occupying Hostomel Airport just northwest of the capital, only to be repelled. Within hours, Washington and its allies announced the package of sanctions that they had long prepared. Four large Russian banks were made subject to “blocking sanctions,” which froze any assets that touched the U.S. financial system, and several others, including the largest, Sberbank, were made subject to a somewhat less severe suite of sanctions. Export controls were imposed, by the U.S. and many other Western countries, to degrade the high-tech parts of the Russian economy, and a day later came a round of personal sanctions on Putin and several of his senior foreign-policy aides. But the oil and gas sector, which supplies forty per cent of the Russian budget, was left largely untouched, and there was no effort to move against the Russian Central Bank. A. Wess Mitchell, who was the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs in the Trump Administration, told me, “A lot of people asked ‘Is that it?’ when they heard the President’s February 24th press conference,” Mitchell said. “After all the Administration’s warnings of catastrophic sanctions in the lead-up to the war, the opening tranche of sanctions was astonishingly weak.” The markets moved on the news of the sanctions, but they did not entirely collapse. Something like this had already been priced in."

Unless these rifts are handled deftly, the Biden administration’s vision of a new global economic order in which the United States works with allies and partners in Europe and Asia to contain Chinese and Russian ambitions could degenerate into a world of competing economic blocs.

After quietly rumbling for months, the spats burst into the open last week. Thierry Breton, the European Union’s internal market commissioner, announced he would pull out of this week’s meetings in Maryland of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, a key coordinating body for trans-Atlantic economic policy. He said the agenda “no longer gives sufficient space to issues of concern to many European industry ministers and businesses,” pointing to EU complaints over new U.S. subsidies for electric vehicles and clean energy that disadvantage European carmakers and other companies. Instead, he said, he would focus on “the urgent need to preserve the competitiveness of Europe’s industrial base.”

French President Emmanuel Macron, who was in Washington last week to attend the first White House state dinner held since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, said that U.S. subsidies “are very good for the U.S. economy, but they weren’t properly coordinated with European economies.” In advance of the visit, Bruno Le Maire, French minister of the economy and finance, accused the United States of pursuing Chinese-style industrial policy.

The subsidies at issue are part of two massive bills passed by the U.S. Congress earlier this year: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the CHIPS and Science Act. The former offers as much as $370 billion in subsidies for faster adoption of clean energy in the United States. It includes tax credits for U.S. buyers of electric vehicles—but only if the vehicles are assembled in North America and their components are made in the United States or other select “free-trade partners,” language that would hurt European car companies such as Volkswagen and BMW. The latter bill offers $52 billion in support for semiconductor companies to build new high-end fabrication plants in the United States. European leaders see both measures as unfairly subsidizing U.S. companies, aggravating the continent’s competitiveness challenges, and potentially forcing Europe into a costly subsidy arms race with the U.S. and China.

The Dutch government also pushed back publicly last week against U.S. pressure on its major producers of equipment for making chips, ASML and ASM International, to cut ties with China. The United States has launched a sweeping campaign to block sales of high-end semiconductors and chip-making equipment to China but has yet to persuade allies like Japan and the Netherlands to go along. Dutch Economics Minister Micky Adriaansens told the Financial Times that her country is “very positive” about relations with China and that Europe and the Netherlands “should have their own strategy” on controlling exports to China.

The growing divisions are partly a consequence of Russia’s war on Ukraine. While the United States and Europe have maintained a united front on sanctions against Russia and military aid for Ukraine, Europe has paid a much higher economic price for the conflict. Natural gas prices in most European countries have soared to as much as 10 times U.S. levels, putting European industry at a huge competitive disadvantage. While the United States has helped Europe fill the loss of Russian gas with liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, it is being sold at the currently inflated market prices. France’s ambassador in Washington, Phillipe Étienne, told Foreign Policy: “We are grateful that the United States provides Europe with LNG, but there are issues about the price.”

Longer term, the disputes center on the conflicting goals of the Biden administration’s industrial policies. On the one hand, the United States wants to build a robust supply chain that reduces China’s role in supplying critical technologies and inputs for the industries of the future. That requires close cooperation with allies—what the administration has termed “friendshoring”—to prevent wasteful duplication and ensure greater resilience of supply. On the other hand, the administration is eager to see the revival of U.S.-based manufacturing, believing the loss of manufacturing—due in part to Chinese competition—weakened U.S. security and harmed the economy. Lost manufacturing jobs also eroded voter support for the Democrats in industrial swing states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Each of the new U.S. measures puts a thumb on the scale in favor of companies investing in the United States rather than Europe or other close partners.

Biden’s Commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, whose father lost his job of 28 years at the Bulova watch factory in Rhode Island when the company moved production to China, put it clearly in a speech at MIT last week: “Going forward, we are not only going to invent the technologies of the future in America, but we are going to manufacture them here, too.” Not surprisingly, this does not sit well with U.S. allies and other trading partners, who face the prospect of losing markets in China as the United States insists they embrace new restrictions, only to see multinational companies relocate to or expand production in the United States in order to take advantage of cheaper energy and generous subsidies.

The Europeans are not alone in their concerns. World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is trying to protect the nondiscrimination norm—the requirement that trade partners are treated equally—that has been at the heart of trade multilateralism for 75 years. She argues that few countries embrace the binary choices being offered by the Biden administration. “Many countries don’t want to have to choose between two blocs,” she said in a speech at the Lowy Institute in Australia. Forcing such choices could damage progress on issues where the United States, China, and other countries have no choice but to work together. She warned that “policy-induced decoupling designed to build resilience and security could end up feeling like an own goal,” harming cooperation on collective challenges such as climate change, pandemics, or sovereign debt distress.

Biden’s words prior to the state dinner with Macron suggest he is acutely aware of European concerns and willing to try to ameliorate them. He said the two leaders “agreed to discuss practical steps to coordinate and align our approaches” and ensure that manufacturing and innovation are strengthened “on both sides of the Atlantic.” Macron echoed that the two sides had agreed to “resynchronize our approaches.” “We can work out some of the differences that exist,” Biden said. “I’m confident.”

The details will not be easy to resolve, though. Biden candidly admitted there were “glitches” in the legislation that should be fixed. But it is unclear, for example, whether the IRA’s language on extending subsidies to goods produced by free-trade partners can be stretched to include the EU. And there are many in the Congress and the administration, as well as in industries such as steel and solar, who are committed to the legislation’s “America first” principle, believing the United States is long overdue for a manufacturing revival. They will push back against an overly generous interpretation of the law.

Biden and European leaders are well aware that they cannot permit a fundamental trans-Atlantic rift to open. More than at any time since the height of the Cold War, the dual threat of Russia and China is forcing the United States and Europe to cooperate and work through economic disputes that might have festered for many years in less stressful times—such as the long tussle over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing.

The high stakes suggest the two sides will find a way through. As Macron put it: “The circumstances mean that we have no alternative but to work together.”"

President Joe Biden on Wednesday will hold his second closed-door meeting with his senior economic team in less than a week, marking a notable increase in tempo as global markets are rattled by a mix of soaring inflation, Europe’s energy crisis and China’s downturn.

White House economic officials have also closely eyed the growing tumult in the United Kingdom, as new Prime Minister Liz Truss’ economic plan has thrown the economy into turmoil and already drawn a Bank of England intervention, officials say.

Biden and his top advisers maintain the US faces the current international volatility from a position of strength, with an economy that has maintained steady job and wage growth through months of high inflation and international tumult.

“The United States of America is in a stronger position than any other country to navigate these global challenges, period,” Biden said at a meeting of his Competition Council comprised of top administration economic and cabinet officials earlier this week.

While Biden is regularly updated on the state of the economy, the two closed-door meetings – one noted on the public schedule, one that was not – underscore a view inside the West Wing that the administration must remain vigilant as the global economy faces an array of post-pandemic and Ukraine conflict headwinds.

White House officials have grappled with an uncertain and often unstable global economy since their first day in office. The economic emergency from the pandemic came in fits and starts, and drove a myriad of supply chain challenges and headaches. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine created a new, and acutely painful, threat earlier this year as energy prices around the world soared.

But Biden’s team has been unequivocal that despite four-decade high inflation, the US remains in a stronger position than any other economy in the world. It’s a critical message just two months from the midterm elections, where the economy remains a central issue in the campaign battles underway across the message.

National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said this week the White House is paying “a lot of attention” to areas of particular weakness in the global economy – areas that included the challenges facing Europe, the UK and China.

“We’re certainly in a complicated and in many ways unprecedented transition, but I think that there’s every reason to have a lot of confidence in the US position in the context of a globally uncertain environment,” Deese said at a Tuesday event hosted by the Economic Club of Washington DC.

Biden’s meeting on Wednesday was noted on his public schedule, in part, to underscore that the President is paying attention to the unsettling global economic picture, one official familiar with the planning said.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse are scheduled to attend the meeting, among others, according to a White House official.

The scale and diffuse nature of the global challenges – and concern over potential spill-over effects on the US economy – have drawn a sustained focus inside the West Wing.

“We meet at a moment, to state the obvious, of global uncertainty and — in countries around the world grappling with elevated inflation and – and an ongoing war in Ukraine is presenting challenges as well,” Biden said.

But even as Biden and his economic team grapple with high inflation, a White House official pointed to a series of major economic legislative victories as critical to laying the groundwork for an economy able to withstand the current unpredictability.

Officials still view it as unlikely that the US will see a significant effect from the energy crisis that has coursed through Europe due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US remains a leading producer of oil and gas, where Europe has rapidly attempted to wean itself off of significant reliance on Russian energy.

“The situation in Europe and the UK is very, very difficult right now,” Deese said. “They’re significantly more exposed to energy price volatility and they don’t have some of the incumbent strengths that we have here economically.”

US officials have worked intensively for months the mitigate the effects of markets sapped of Russia’s energy supply, primarily in order to maintain the unity critical to the Western coalition that has supported Ukraine throughout the war.

China’s downturn, at least in the near-term, has played a key role in a paradoxically positive effect on one critical area: Gas prices.

But officials are keeping a close eye on the world’s second largest economy, even as Biden’s primary public focus on the American economy – and what officials view as critical accomplishments given the global turmoil – has remained steadfast.

“Over the last few years, we’ve faced some of the most difficult challenges in our history, but we’re actually making progress helping folks get just a little more breathing room,” Biden said this week."
288,The Biden Labor Department’s new rule could upend the gig economy and misclassifying workers. - Vox.com,The Biden Labor Department’s new rule could upend the gig economy and misclassifying workers.  Vox.com,"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcG9saWN5LWFuZC1wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIyLzEwLzEyLzIzMzk4NzI3L2JpZGVuLXdvcmtlci1taXNjbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbi1pbmRlcGVuZGVudC1jb250cmFjdG9yLWxhYm9y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Vox.com,"The Biden administration has released a long-awaited proposal that could make it easier for millions of truckers, Uber drivers, freelance writers, home care workers, and janitors to be classified as employees rather than independent contractors — a shift that would grant them access to a host of federal labor protections.

The Biden administration’s 184-page proposed rule would change how the federal agency determines who constitutes an employee or an independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the 1938 law that determines eligibility for protections like minimum wage, overtime, Social Security, and unemployment insurance.

It’s the latest development in a legal back-and-forth between presidential administrations that stretches back more than a decade. If the rule is finalized, it will almost certainly be challenged in court.

The rule could have ramifications for the so-called gig economy. Companies like Uber, Lyft, and Instacart have argued that classifying their drivers as employees rather than contractors would devastate their business models. Other self-employed workers defend their independent contractor status, and say they prefer the flexibility and autonomy they’re afforded as they seek to balance other priorities in their lives.

If the Biden administration’s proposed rule goes into effect — a big if — it could have significant consequences for workers and businesses alike.

In the waning days of the Trump administration, the Labor Department finalized a new rule that gave extra weight to two specific questions when determining if someone is an independent contractor: how much control does a worker have over their work — can they set their own schedule, work for multiple employers, and reject certain projects? And how great is a worker’s opportunity for profit or loss based on their own initiative or investment? One tenet of independent contracting is that there should be “entrepreneurial opportunity” built into the arrangement.

Organized labor has long held that this sort of employee classification test is too narrow, and that a broader “multi-factorial” test should be used to ensure higher working standards for as many people as possible. Union activists say a better test would give roughly equal weight to at least seven factors, including how important the worker is for the employer’s business, and how long the worker is employed.

The Biden administration agrees. It wrote in its new proposal that it sees reverting back to this broader test as “more consistent with existing judicial precedent and the Department’s longstanding guidance prior” to the 2021 Trump rule.

Rondu Gantt, an Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash driver based in San Francisco who organizes with the campaign Gig Workers Rising, said in a statement, “This rule can help establish bedrock protections for app-based workers like me and give us an important tool to fight for respect and safety on the job. Gig workers deserve all of the rights that other employees have, including the right to organize. This rule can also help protect workers all around the country as gig corporations try to bring their abusive model to the rest of the economy.”

Federal courts have rejected past attempts to make the independent contracting rule more worker-friendly

The lines between contracting and employment have been blurring in the age of remote work, but in general, it’s about how much control an employer exerts over an individual performing work for them, and what legal entitlements a worker can expect as a result. One major legal entitlement employees enjoy is the right to join a union. Another is the right to be paid at least the minimum wage, and for businesses to pay a portion of their Social Security tax. Contractors have no such guarantees, but some prefer the flexibility, and say they’d trade the workplace protections for freedom from a boss.

The federal government has not made adjudicating this debate simple. In 1947, Congress explicitly carved out independent contractors from the National Labor Relations Act’s definition of “employee.”

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in its United Insurance decision that the “obvious purpose” of Congress excluding independent contractors from the law was to have the NLRB and courts “apply the common-law agency test” when distinguishing an employee from an independent contractor. Since then, the board and courts have used a 10-factor test to settle the question. Much of the legal debate over the last 15 years has been over whether any of those 10 factors — particularly entrepreneurial opportunity — should weigh more heavily than others.

In 2006, FedEx Home Delivery drivers in Massachusetts sought to unionize with the Teamsters, but after they won their union election, FedEx refused to bargain with the drivers, saying they were independent contractors. The National Labor Relations Board sided with the drivers in 2007, but two years later, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit overturned the NLRB’s decision, pointing to the drivers’ “entrepreneurial potential” — meaning their ability to shape both their work conditions for FedEx and additional clients — as a decisive factor. The appellate judges wrote in their decision that the NLRB “has no authority whatsoever over independent contractors.”

The NLRB chose not to appeal this to the Supreme Court, the only US court whose rulings the NLRB considers as binding. So when a similar case came back up a half-decade later, the NLRB sided with FedEx drivers again. (This case involved Hartford, Connecticut, drivers who unionized.)

Three years later, in 2017, the DC Circuit rejected the NLRB’s ruling once again, and pointed back to its 2009 decision when it said, “The question before this court was already asked and answered.”

As all this was going on, businesses like Uber that rely heavily on independent contracting continued to expand, and began to look at currying favor with sympathetic politicians who could help codify their legally vulnerable business models. Corporate executives kept a wary eye on the legal battles unfolding in Washington, DC, but few felt real pressure to change their practices amid the uncertainty.

By January 2019, the NLRB, which at this point had a Republican-appointee majority on its five-member panel, formally overturned its 2014 FedEx decision, in a case where a regional NLRB office had found that shuttle drivers who owned and operated franchises of SuperShuttle DFW were independent contractors. This 2019 SuperShuttle decision effectively reverted society back to the old gig economy-friendly independent contractor standard.

Biden’s team has hinted it would be revisiting the misclassification issue

The Biden administration has been building toward action on this issue for years.

Biden’s presidential campaign emphasized supporting and standing with labor unions, and the week of his inauguration he forced out two Trump-appointed NLRB counsels, the first time in more than 70 years a president exercised that power. He then appointed Democrat Lauren McFerran, the lone dissenter in the 2019 SuperShuttle decision, to serve as NLRB board chair, and his administration blocked the Trump independent contractor rule from taking effect.

Biden also nominated Jennifer Abruzzo, a lawyer with the Communications Workers of America, to serve as the NLRB’s general counsel. By August 2021 Abruzzo had issued a 10-page memo laying out her priorities and instructed the agency’s regional offices to prioritize cases that pertain to specific past decisions, including the 2019 SuperShuttle case.

﻿In late December, the National Labor Relations Board announced it would be accepting briefs relating to whether the federal agency should reconsider its standard — again — for determining independent contractor status.

The fierce debate over contracting and the global economy

When the NLRB issued its request for briefs in late December, it asked two main questions: Should the board stick to the independent contractor standard it established in its 2019 SuperShuttle decision? And if not, then what standard should replace it: should the NLRB return to its 2014 standard set by the more union-friendly FedEx Home Delivery decision?

Public interest, government, and industry groups submitted more than 30 amicus briefs and were far from unanimous. While many of the same arguments were recycled from the FedEx and SuperShuttle cases, briefs also featured some new themes, like that misclassification of workers poses an antitrust threat. One brief, filed by the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, argued that “a vague or under-inclusive” employee standard could harm workers, employers, and competition directly.

The Labor Department rule is technically separate from the NLRB request for documents, though it centers on very similar legal questions. Before Tuesday, the Labor Department says, its wage and hour division considered feedback shared by stakeholders in forums held during the summer of 2022.

“Standards and definitions under both statutes are a little different, but it’s definitely the same fruit salad and the two pieces of fruit are right next to each other,” said Michael Lotito, a management-side labor attorney at the law firm Littler Mendelson.

AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler hailed the draft rule on Tuesday for “restoring commonsense rules to determine who is an employee, and making it harder for employers to intentionally misclassify their employees as independent contractors.” In the organization’s filed briefs to the NLRB, it warned against trying to revert back to a standard that couldn’t survive the courts.

An NLRB brief filed by Democratic attorneys general representing 15 states and Washington, DC, argued that the “entrepreneurial opportunity” standard privileged by SuperShuttle is “particularly vulnerable to evasion” by employers.

They urged instead weighting the three factors that form the basis for the so-called “ABC” tests used by many states to determine employee status, a test that makes it harder to classify someone as a contractor. A worker is only considered a contractor under this test if they have relative independence from the business paying their wages, if their work is separate from the type of work the business is typically engaged in, and if they typically do the type of work that the business hired them to do. In particular, “entrepreneurial opportunity” is insufficient to merit contractor status under the ABC test.

Some groups had urged the NLRB to find a new middle-ground position.

Buckle, a digital financial services company that provides insurance and credit options to drivers for ride-share and other gig companies, said the NLRB “should not be afraid to set a precedent allowing both employees and independent contractors.” For example, they said, their data indicates that 80 to 90 percent of drivers on gig platforms work less than 20 hours a week. But for the 10 to 20 percent who drive 20 hours or more per week, and who “are heavily relied upon” by the companies to maintain consistent service levels, there should be clearer pathways to distinguish between them and the more casual workers.

Other groups pushed the Biden administration to adhere to the status quo. One brief representing 12 Republican senators and another brief representing 30 Republican representatives pointed out that the Democratic-backed Protecting Right to Organize Act, which would make it harder to classify workers as independent contractors, failed to pass in the Senate. “Congressional opposition to the change is, in part, because many Members believe that the current approach is best adapted to a twenty-first century economy,” the GOP officials wrote.

The US Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby, also warned of government overreach. There is no reason for the NLRB to depart from its SuperShuttle standard, the Chamber wrote in its brief, and to do so “is a plain instance of its policy reach far exceeding its legitimate regulatory grasp.”

Some groups representing freelancers and small businesses also urged the NLRB against revising its contracting standard, worried they would lose their prized independent status. They pointed to government surveys, like a 2015 GAO report that found more than 85 percent of independent contractors and those self-employed appeared content with their status. In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 79 percent of independent contractors preferred their contracting arrangement over a traditional job.

The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council issued a statement on Tuesday calling the Labor Department’s rule “out-of-touch with the modern economy and how people want to work.”

Given this opposition, a court challenge to the rule seems inevitable. Lotito, the labor lawyer, told Vox he thinks the Biden administration’s new rule will fail in court, and pointed to his firm’s successful challenge against the Biden administration’s withdrawal of Trump’s worker classification rule. “My overall sense is that they really did not pay any attention to the [Texas] District Court’s decision; there’s no explanation that I’ve read so far that explains how the Trump rule has interfered with their ability to enforce their mission,” he said. “From an Administrative Procedure Act perspective, I also think this is a straight flop.”

However, no legal challenge can be mounted against the rule until it is finalized. The Department of Labor is currently soliciting public comments on its proposal, and the final rule will likely not be issued for another few months."

Hers was the clearest and most persuasive presentation to date of the main strands of U.S. economic strategy toward China. Yet the speech also highlighted a few unresolved tensions and gaps in the Biden approach to China—and in its international economy policy more broadly.

Noting that Beijing had abandoned the path of reform and opening that had been the rationale for earlier U.S. economic engagement with China, and citing a “dramatically transformed strategic environment,” Raimondo laid out four components of Biden’s economic strategy: investing in competitiveness, innovation, and talent at home; hardening defenses against threats to U.S. workers, businesses, and national security; aligning with allies and partners to shape the environment around China; and continuing to engage with China in ways consistent with U.S. interests and values.

There was much to like about the speech. It was the clearest articulation yet by a senior Biden official of the need to balance the imperatives of protecting U.S. national security and remaining engaged with China economically and diplomatically. As discussed further below, this is a tricky balance to strike and will require skillful choreography along all four lines of effort presented by Raimondo.

The speech was also pitched well in both substance and tone. Raimondo implicitly started with a presumption of economic openness and market-based solutions as being best for both U.S. prosperity and security, with government interventions such as industrial policies and export controls as exceptions. She stated clearly that the United States is “not seeking the decoupling of our economy from that of China’s.” And the tone of the speech was confident and optimistic, not dark and forbidding, as too many presentations on China in Washington are these days.

The Biden administration has taken significant steps along each of the four lines of effort laid out by Raimondo. On the first, it has won congressional approval for roughly $2 trillion of domestic investments over 10 years through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. On Raimondo’s second component, the administration has pursued a systematic—and so far judicious—tightening of national security protections, including the sweeping semiconductor export controls imposed on October 7.

Despite the agitation that these first two sets of actions have provoked in some allied capitals, the Biden administration has demonstrated a genuine impulse to work with partners in Europe and Asia, consulting regularly and using an array of new and existing forums—from the G7 to the Quad—to strengthen allied cooperation. And finally, President Biden’s meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping last month in Bali was a nod to the fourth of Raimondo’s components: finding a way to work constructively with Beijing.

So again, there is much to like about Biden’s China economic strategy. Yet two unresolved issues and one major gap remain. Essentially, these correspond to the three tensions in Biden’s approach to international economic policy that I identified in a piece published on the first full day of the administration in January 2021.

One tension is between Raimondo’s first and third lines of efforts: investing at home and working with allies. This has now blown to the surface as allies in Europe and Asia pummel the administration for the subsidies and local content requirements for electric vehicle and battery production included in the IRA, which allies say discriminate against their commercial interests. One Korean official even called the IRA provisions “a betrayal,” and another former official said it was “like being stabbed in the back.” This does not bode well for administration efforts to persuade allies to follow the United States in sharpening competition with China.

President Biden said publicly during the recent visit of President Macron of France that he would find a solution to the IRA problem that supports allied interests, but this will be difficult in practice given congressional dynamics and the clear language of the law favoring North American producers. More broadly, the White House has work to do to allay understandable allied concerns about a protectionist bent in U.S. policy in recent years, which started with the Trump tariffs but has continued through the first two years of the Biden term.

The second tension is between the administration’s dueling impulses to confront Beijing and to engage with it. In her speech, Raimondo acknowledged this tension by elaborating in her fourth component on the reasons to engage—from export opportunities presented by the large Chinese market to the imperative of working with Beijing on shared global challenges such as climate change and food insecurity. The White House emphasis on a “small yard, high fence” approach to export controls is also premised on the idea that Washington and Beijing can continue to interact in the rest of the garden.

But, to use another popular metaphor, is it really feasible for the United States to run faster, attempt to trip up China, and also expect Beijing to want to remain in a friendly race? With the Trump tariffs still in place, technology controls ratcheting up, and China doubling down on its own version of decoupling—technological self-sufficiency—there is good reason to doubt whether Beijing will be willing to engage constructively with Washington, even on shared global concerns, let alone the nonmarket practices and human rights abuses that Raimondo cited in her speech.

This is not to argue that the first three strands of Raimondo’s approach are misplaced; all are vital. But it will be important for the administration to make clear in its words and actions that these are targeted responses to specific concerns about U.S. competitiveness and national security, not a wider effort to stymie China’s development. It would also be useful to seek Beijing’s practical cooperation on the most pressing global public goods such as food, health, and a sustainable climate through institutions in which the United States and China are both members—the World Bank, World Trade Organization, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, which the United States will host in 2023.

In addition to these tensions, there is one gaping hole in the Biden administration’s China economic strategy: lack of a credible trade policy. If, as Secretary Raimondo stated forcefully in her speech, the United States wants to work with allies and partners to “advance our shared values and shape the strategic environment in which China operates,” then a trade policy that incentivizes partners to join us in advancing U.S.-preferred economic rules and norms is essential.

As I have written elsewhere, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), and other initiatives cited by Raimondo have promise, but they lack two key elements of a traditional trade agreement: a single point of leadership in the executive branch, and congressional buy-in. The latter in turn is essential to deliver two things U.S. partners want: incentives for them to adopt high standards—greater market access or money to support economic development—and a sense of durability to U.S. undertakings.

Having achieved historic investments in U.S. economic strength, and facing a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the second half of its term, the Biden administration has an opportunity in 2023 to pursue a more robust trade policy that advances not only U.S. commercial interests but also its preferred norms and values.



Two years into the Biden administration, the elements of its China economic strategy are coming into clearer definition. Overall, the approach is sound, but it needs a few tweaks and additions to persuade domestic stakeholders, allies and partners, and Beijing itself that the administration is serious about balancing competition and engagement and advancing shared interests. No less important, a more confident, optimistic tone from Washington policymakers—the kind used by Secretary Raimondo in her speech—would be welcome.

Two months ahead of the midterm elections, President Biden’s approval ratings and perceptions of the economy have improved, although both are still largely negative.

On the heels of several policy successes for the president, 45% of Americans approve of his job performance, up from his lowest rating of 36% in July. While only 38% approve of how Biden is handling the economy, that is also up from its low point in June, when 28% approved.

The improvement in Biden’s ratings is largely driven by renewed support among Democrats. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats approve of Biden’s job performance, up from 65% in July and 72% in June.

Democrats have also increased their positive opinion of how the president is handling the economy. Sixty-six percent approve of his economic policies, up from 54% in June.

While still negative, independents have become slightly more positive about Biden’s job performance since June. At that time 25% approved of how he was handling his job; now 36% do. And in June, 14% of independents approved of Biden’s management of the economy; now 28% have a favorable view.

Republicans remain highly negative of the president’s job performance.

Views of economic conditions remain negative, though are rosier now compared to June. Again, Democrats have an improved view of the economy, while Republicans remain largely negative.

Twenty-seven percent of Americans now say things in the country are headed in the right direction, up from 17% in July and 14% in June. Democrats are particularly more optimistic compared with earlier this summer. In the latest poll, 44% of Democrats say the country is headed in the right direction and 54% say it is going in the wrong direction. In June, only 21% of Democrats said things were going in the right direction.

The nationwide poll was conducted September 9-12, 2022 using the AmeriSpeak® Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,054 adults. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3.9 percentage points."

However, the Biden administration’s policies are only making matters worse.

According to an analysis from the Joint Economic Committee, the average American family is paying an additional $635 per month for household expenses compared to January 2021. Gas and groceries are becoming unaffordable. In Louisiana, the average family is paying an extra $65 per month on food costs and an additional $493 each month on fuel and energy expenses. Those increased monthly costs are leading many families to the brink of financial ruin. No individual is immune from Biden’s inflation crisis, and working-class families and seniors on fixed incomes are being hit the hardest.

Out-of-control spending, big government regulatory overreach, and anti-American energy policies from the Biden White House created this crisis. Elitist career politicians have stolen the strength of our nation and sapped the people dry. The Biden administration has spent trillions on every imaginable absurdity, mortgaging our nation’s future for generations yet unborn. And President Biden and Democrats in Congress are calling for more spending, more taxes, more government interference, and less American oil and gas. Continuing with this same failed course of action will only worsen the inflation crisis that is dealing serious financial injury to millions of American families.

The Biden administration has produced the worst economic climate since Jimmy Carter. Prices are going up. Wages are going down. Supply chain bottlenecks have made certain goods challenging to find, and businesses are having difficulty finding workers. We are on the precipice of stagflation. Consumer costs are rising rapidly while post-COVID economic recovery is grinding to a halt.

The American people cannot afford more of the same failed policies from the Biden administration. Liberal, agenda-driven policies brought us here. They cannot return us to prosperity. Instead, we must restore our nation and fight inflation with sound fiscal policies. This is precisely what I and many of my Republican colleagues are fighting for in Congress.

When Republicans retake majority control in 2023, we will forcefully reject Biden’s tax and spending agenda. From there, we must work together to advance Constitutionalist and Conservative policies that rebuild and restore economic prosperity. This includes cutting wasteful spending, unleashing American energy production, reversing regulatory overreach, and ensuring the Trump tax cuts continue.

More specifically, these are steps that we can immediately take to combat inflation and deliver relief for the American people:

Repurpose leftover COVID monies: Hundreds of billions of dollars from Democrats’ $2 trillion COVID spending bill remain unobligated. Those funds should be repurposed and returned to the U.S. Treasury, where they can be used to reduce the deficit and pay down our debt.

Unleash American energy production: President Biden’s war on the American oil and gas industry has caused fuel costs to more than double. His anti-American policies must end. We should immediately end the drilling moratorium on federal lands and waters, restart oil and gas lease sales, greenlight the Keystone XL pipeline, reverse royalty rate increases, and streamline permit approvals for new energy infrastructure.

Stop Biden’s tax hike: The Biden administration has threatened to repeal the Trump tax cuts, which would result in higher taxes for 90% of Americans. Such a tax increase would devastate economic recovery efforts and further raise costs for American families.

Cut red tape and reverse regulatory overreach: President Biden’s regulatory agenda has increased costs for industry and slowed private-sector innovation. We need less government interference, not more. We must repeal onerous regulations that unjustly penalize private industry and increase the cost of production for everyday goods.

Get Americans working again: Democrat policies during the COVID pandemic paid people more to stay home than go to work. As a result, businesses large and small have struggled to meet labor demands. Labor shortages have contributed to rising consumer costs, and we must end the remaining subsidies that discourage work.

Secure the Border: Americans from sea to shining sea are witnessing horrific crime that has heavily impacted economic dynamics in every State, yet we witness the total disintegration of our sovereignty at the southern border. Economic prosperity requires law and order. The Biden administration has long ago lost operational control of our border, and every American can feel it in our wallet as we watch it with our eyes.

These are real solutions that can be enacted to mitigate the current economic crisis, help lower prices, restore supply chains, and return America to a path toward prosperity. A healthy and robust economy benefits every American citizen. We had that under President Trump, and our mission is to return to that era of economic success.

Pollsters and economists say there has never been as wide a gap between the underlying health of the economy and public perception. The divergence could be a decisive factor in whether the Democrat secures a second term next year. Republicans are seizing on the dissatisfaction to skewer Biden, while the White House is finding less success as it tries to highlight economic progress.

“Things are getting better and people think things are going to get worse — and that’s the most dangerous piece of this,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who has worked with Biden. Lake said voters no longer want to just see inflation rates fall — rather, they want an outright decline in prices, something that last happened on a large scale during the Great Depression.

“Honestly, I’m kind of mystified by it,” she said.

By many measures, the U.S. economy is rock solid. Friday’s employment report showed that employers added 199,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7%. Inflation has plummeted in little over a year from a troubling 9.1% to 3.2% without causing a recession — a phenomenon that some once skeptical economists have dubbed “immaculate.”

Yet people remain dejected about the economy, according to the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment. The preliminary December figures issued Friday showed a jump in sentiment as people seem to recognize that inflation is cooling. But the index is still slightly below its July level.

In a possible warning sign for Biden, people surveyed for the index brought up the 2024 election. Sentiment rose dramatically more among Republicans than Democrats, potentially suggesting that GOP voters became more optimistic about winning back the White House.

“Consumers have been feeling broadly uneasy about the economy since the pandemic, and they are still coming to grips with the notion that we are not returning to the pre-pandemic ‘normal,’” Joanne Hsu, director and chief economist of the survey, said of the overall trend in recent months.

Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, stressed that a strong underlying economy is “absolutely necessary” to eventually lifting consumer sentiment. His argument is that as the economy continues to improve, more people will recognize the benefits and sentiment will improve.

“We’ve got to keep fighting to lower costs and build on the progress that we’ve made,” Bernstein said. “We just need more time to get these gains to working Americans — that’s our plan.”

The White House has made three major shifts in its messaging in hopes of building up confidence in Biden’s economic leadership. The president this summer began to pepper his speeches with the term “Bidenomics” to describe his policies, only to have Republicans latch onto the word as a point of attack.

White House officials have pointed out specific items for which prices have fallen outright. They noted lower prices for turkeys during Thanksgiving as well as for eggs. Biden repeatedly emphasizes that he lowered insulin costs for Medicare participants, while other officials discuss how gasoline prices have dropped from their peak.

Second, Biden recently started to blame inflation on corporations that hiked prices when they saw an opportunity to improve their profits, bringing more prominence to an argument first used when gasoline prices spiked. The president’s argument is suspicious to many economists, yet the intended message to voters is that Biden is fighting for them against those he blames for fueling inflation.

“Let me be clear: Any corporation that is not passing these savings on to the consumers needs to stop their price gouging,” Biden said recently in Pueblo, Colorado. “The American people are tired of being played for suckers.”

And Biden is now going after the track record of former President Donald Trump, the current GOP front-runner. Biden’s campaign sent out a statement after Friday’s employment report that said, “ Despite his claims of being a jobs president, Donald Trump had the worst jobs record since the Great Depression, losing nearly three million jobs.”

The Republican counter to Biden has been to dismiss the positive economic data and focus on how voters are feeling. As the annual inflation rate has fallen, GOP messaging has focused instead on multi-year increases in consumer prices without necessarily factoring in wage gains. And Republican lawmakers have argued that people should trust their gut on the economy instead of the statistics cited by Biden.

“Joe Biden’s message to them is just this: He says don’t believe your lying eyes,” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, said in a recent floor speech.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, put the blame solely on Biden for inflation and people feeling downtrodden.

“The challenge is rising cost of living,” said Youngkin, speaking at a Monday event in Washington hosted by Bloomberg News. “And it’s just clear over the course of now the last three years of the Biden economy we have seen inflation really run away from a lot of folks and 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.”

Biden’s speeches over the past two years have done little to improve his anemic polling on the economy. Administration officials had once assumed that better economic numbers would overcome any doubts among voters, only to find that the negativity stayed even as the U.S. economy became likely to avoid a recession once forecasted by economists.

Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, has been surprised by the anger generated online when she has noted the signs of a strong economy.

A typical U.S. household is better off than it was in 2020. Inequality has lessened somewhat in recent years as wage growth has favored poorer workers. Yet people still seem rattled and disconnected by the shock of the pandemic, the arrival of government aid and the inflation that followed as hiring improved.

“People have really been jerked around,” Sahm said. “Things have been turned on and off. Everything has moved fast. It’s been disruptive and confusing. We’re just tired.”

There is no solitary cause for this gap between the major data and public feeling. But the experts trying to make sense of things have multiple theories about what’s going on. Besides the pandemic’s impact, it’s possible that social media has distorted how people feel about the economy as they watch the posh lifestyles of influencers. Many people also judge the economy based on their own political beliefs, rather than the underlying numbers.

It could simply be that people need time to adjust after a period of rising inflation. As a result, there’s a lag before a slowing rate of inflation boosts how consumers feel, according to a recent analysis by economists Ryan Cummings and Neale Mahoney.

“Sentiment is still being weighed down by the high inflation we had last year,” Cummings said. “As that recedes further into the rearview mirror, its effects are likely to diminish.”

Another possibility is that the loss of pandemic aid from the government left people materially poorer. Millions of households got checks from the government and an expanded child tax credit deposited directly into their accounts. Republicans blamed this funding for feeding inflation, but the money also initially helped to shelter people from the pain of rising prices.

Adjusting for government transfers and taxes, the average annual income for someone in the lower half of earners was $34,800 when Biden took office, according to an analysis provided by Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.

That average fell to $26,100 by March 2023 in a sign that wage growth could not make up for the loss of government aid.

Samuel Rines, an investment strategist at Corbu, found that companies including Pepsi, Kraft-Heinz, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark latched onto the higher food and energy prices after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to boost their own products’ prices and increase profits.

Earnings reports suggest that consumers started to tire of some companies’ double-digit price increases this summer, prompting those companies to indicate that future prices increases will be closer to the historic average of 2%.

Biden can reasonably argue that companies took advantage of the war in Ukraine and the pandemic to raise their prices, Rines said. But the increases happened 12 to 18 months ago and Biden’s current argument doesn’t apply to what businesses are doing now.

Rines said of the president’s message on price gouging: “It’s pretty much 18 months too late.”

But how do their claims stack up?

The presidential election is less than a year away, and economic issues are once again top of mind for voters around the country. Despite the economy’s rapid recovery from the pandemic, President Biden has struggled to convince Americans that his policies are improving their finances. In polls, the majority of Americans still say they trust former president Donald Trump’s handling of the economy over Biden’s.

Both presidents’ economic records have been defined by the pandemic and its aftershocks. The covid crisis upended the job market, stoked decades-high inflation and added trillions of dollars to the federal debt.

The economy today is vastly different than it was in 2017, when Trump took office. But the data shows just how each administration has left its mark: Biden, by adding 14 million jobs in less than three years, bringing the Black unemployment rate to a record low and reducing student loan debt by billions. Trump, meanwhile, presided over a period of low inflation, low interest rates and low gas prices.

Here are 12 charts showing the state of the economy now vs. under Trump.

1. Job gains

The astoundingly strong labor market is arguably the White House’s biggest victory. In some ways, the bump was inevitable — Biden took office at a time when millions were still out of work because of the pandemic. Even so, the rapid job gains in recent years have blown past economists’ expectations and have fueled the economy’s blockbuster growth.

Even more remarkable is that the labor market has remained strong, despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive efforts to slow the economy. As long as Americans are employed, they’ve been able to withstand inflation and keep spending, allowing the economy to grow.

Employers have created more than 14 million jobs during the Biden administration, with a monthly average of more than 400,000 positions. Recently, though, the pace of job creation has slowed, with 216,000 new jobs in December.

By contrast, the economy added an average 176,000 jobs a month during Trump’s first three years, before coronavirus-related closures and layoffs resulted in the sudden loss of more than 20 million jobs.

2. Unemployment rate

Aside from a covid-fueled surge in much of 2020 and 2021, the national unemployment rate has remained low through both Trump’s and Biden’s presidencies.

Joblessness fell during the Trump years to a half-century low of 3.5 percent in early 2020, just before the pandemic. During Biden’s presidency, the unemployment rate has inched down even further, to 3.4 percent earlier last year. It now stands at 3.7 percent.

The years-long pickup in hiring has been particularly good for workers who are typically underrepresented in the labor force. Unemployment rates for Hispanic workers, Black women and people with disabilities have all hit record lows under Biden’s watch.

The Black unemployment rate, which Trump liked to take credit for improving during his presidency, fell during both administrations, but reached an all-time low during the Biden era last year.

3. Economic growth

For the most part, the U.S. economy has expanded at a steady pace under both Trump and Biden. Gross domestic product, a measure of all of the goods and services produced in the country, has grown about 22 percent since Biden took office. That’s compared with a 14 percent uptick during Trump’s presidency, when the pandemic forced the economy into a steep and sudden recession. Even so, the economy rebounded quickly — thanks in part to trillions in stimulus money — and was growing again by the time Trump left office.

Now, under Biden, the economy has notched five straight quarters of growth following a six-month slump last year. The latest expansion has been powered by heavy consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of the economy, and new infrastructure and green-energy projects spearheaded by the Biden administration. But economists note that the current rate of economic growth — an annualized rate of 4.9 percent, as of September — is unsustainable, and many expect growth to cool next year.

4. Gas prices

Presidents have very little control over gas prices. But this is one area where the Trump era was better for Americans — and could help explain some of the gloom Americans are feeling now.

Pandemic-related hiccups, the war in Ukraine and spikes in demand have all sent gas prices on a dizzying roller-coaster ride since 2020. Gas prices more than doubled between April 2020 and April 2022, from $1.84 a gallon to $4.11. They peaked at an all-time high of nearly $5 a gallon in June 2022 but have come down since. Analysts say gas prices could fall below $3 per gallon in the coming weeks, thanks to a combination of increased production and slowing demand.

Gas prices have a direct effect on how Americans view the economy, and higher prices at the pump have translated to lingering pessimism for much of Biden’s presidency.

5. Home prices

Homeownership is one of the biggest ways Americans create wealth, and the recent run-up in prices has been a double-edged sword: Many first-time home buyers been shut out of the market, but people who already own homes have benefited from soaring property values.

On the whole, though, homeownership has become far less accessible during the Biden administration. Home prices surged during the pandemic, rising an eye-popping 49 percent between spring 2020 and fall 2022. Those higher costs have driven housing affordability to all-time lows, according to Goldman Sachs. Homes are selling for a median price of $431,000 — less than the $480,000 they were commanding last year, but still well over pre-pandemic norms.

Mortgage rates have more than doubled in the past two years — from about 3.1 percent to about 7 percent — making it that much pricier to purchase a home and putting a chill on the market. Prices, though, remain high because demand for homes continues to outpace supply.

6. Inflation

Inflation has been a persistent challenge for the Biden administration. A rapid run-up in prices after the pandemic resulted in the highest inflation in more than 40 years. Americans have been pinched by higher costs for just about everything, including groceries, gas, cars and health care.

Share this article Share

Although inflation has recently come down from last summer’s peaks, prices are still about 3 percent higher than they were a year ago. Many Americans say higher costs have tainted their views of the economy, with voters consistently citing inflation as their top economic concern.

7. Interest rates

The president has very little power over interest rates. While the Federal Reserve’s chair and governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by Congress, the central bank operates independently.

But the Fed’s actions have a far-reaching impact on the economy. During Biden’s presidency, the central bank has raised interest rates 11 times as part of its effort to rein in inflation. The bank controls the federal funds target range — the interest rate banks use to lend money to each other overnight — which, at 5.25 to 5.5 percent, is at its highest level in 22 years.

Each time the Fed raises that rate, or even hints that it might, there are ripple effects across the economy, resulting in higher borrowing costs for loans of all types, including mortgages (currently about 7 percent), personal loans (12 percent, according to Bankrate) and credit cards (above 20 percent).

8. Disposable income

Americans have less spending power than they did at the beginning of Biden’s term. A drop-off in stimulus money, plus rising prices, have caused large swings in household income since 2020. Still, many Americans are starting 2024 better off than they were a year ago, as wage gains outpace inflation.

During the Trump years, by comparison, Americans saw a steady increase in spending power until the start of the pandemic. Overall, real disposable income, or what Americans are left with after taxes and inflation, rose about 10 percent between January 2017 and January 2020.

9. Stock market

The stock market rose rapidly during Trump’s presidency and has continued its ascent under Biden. After a period of slowing last year — in anticipation of higher borrowing costs and increased volatility — stock prices have picked back up on optimism that the Fed is done raising interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq hit all-time highs last month, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 is on track to follow suit.

Trump kept a close eye on the stock market’s path during his presidency, often taking to social media to flaunt his successes. He also warned Americans that a Biden presidency would result in a “stock market collapse the likes of which you’ve never had.”

That has not happened — which the president was quick to note. “Good one, Donald,” Biden recently fired back on X.

10. Student loan debt

Outstanding student loan balances have been climbing for nearly two decades — until now.

Biden took office vowing to whittle down the debt burden on student and graduates. And while his most ambitious plans, including a $400 billion forgiveness plan, have been blocked by Republican lawmakers and the Supreme Court, his administration has found ways to offer relief.

To date, the White House has canceled some $132 billion in student loan debt for more than 3.6 million Americans. It has also increased federal Pell Grants to low- and middle-income students, allowing them to take on less debt. As a result, outstanding student loan balances have been falling for six months. Americans owed $1.74 trillion in student loans in October, down from a record $1.77 trillion at the beginning of the year.

11. Consumer sentiment

Despite the economy’s strength, Americans appear downright despondent when it comes to their finances during Biden’s tenure. Consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest level, ever, in June 2022, when gas prices were at a record high. Since then, sentiment has rebounded somewhat but remains lower than it was when Trump was president.

But although they say they feel crummy about the economy, Americans are continuing to spend heavily. That spending — on a variety of goods and services, including cars, travel and dining out — has helped power the economy and keep it growing.

12. Federal deficit

The federal deficit peaked under Trump, though both he and Biden have added trillions to the national debt. The national deficit — or the gap between what the government brings in and what it spends — grew every year of Trump’s presidency. Sweeping tax cuts, followed by the government response to the pandemic, added an unprecedented $7.8 trillion to the country’s debt.

Since then, the deficit narrowed in the first two years of Biden’s presidency. But this year it grew again, by 23 percent, leaving the country with a $1.7 trillion shortfall."

Just over two years ago, then-President-elect Biden addressed the nation in a prime time speech to propose his economic agenda: a plan for a strong, worker-centered economic recovery from the pandemic, followed by long-term investments to lay the foundation for more durable, resilient, and inclusive long-run growth.

In those remarks, the President made a series of concrete commitments to the American people about his plan for economic recovery and renewal. This blog post reviews those commitments and progress made in the two years since they were made.

The President refers to his economic strategy as bottom-up and middle-out economics. That strategy starts with the idea that we should prioritize economic policies that help workers and families recover from economic downturns, avoid the scarring that is too often associated with joblessness and other economic challenges, and provide lower-income and middle-class Americans more breathing room by lowering the costs they face.

Building from the bottom up and middle out also means investing in America – in infrastructure, innovation, and clean energy – in ways that rebuild our industrial strength and supply chains, and expand the productive capacity of the economy. This includes making historic, capacity enhancing investments in our physical infrastructure and our people. It means catalyzing and crowding in private investment in high-growth and high-potential industries, including those that are central to our national security, economic security, and climate and clean energy goals. These kinds of investments won’t just enhance productivity and grow the economy over time – but they can also facilitate more inclusive economic growth that improves living standards for workers and boosts a host of economic outcomes in communities that have long suffered from disinvestment.

Two years in, a review of these commitments underscores that President Biden’s economic strategy is working. Economies around the world including the United States have struggled with pandemic-driven price increases. But we have made important progress in bringing inflation down while maintaining a resilient recovery. In fact, the United States is better-positioned than other major economies to navigate the transition to steady, stable growth with lower inflation and without giving up all the economic gains we have achieved over the last two years. While there is more work to do, and we may face setbacks along the way, the policy strategy we have executed positions us uniquely well to come out of the pandemic crisis stronger, more resilient, and prosperous for years and decades to come.

Take bold action to get American workers back into jobs

“Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance…And it’s not hard to see that we’re in the middle of the once in several generations economic crisis with a once in several generations public health crisis. The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there’s no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now.”

The President-elect began his speech on January 14, 2021 by emphasizing the urgency of bold action to get American workers back into jobs.

Since then, the economy has recovered all of the jobs lost during the pandemic downturn and it did so faster than in the aftermath of the last three major economic downturns – the 1990 – 1991 and 2001 recessions, and the 2007 – 2009 Great Recession.

2021 and 2022 – President Biden’s first two years in office – were the strongest years of job creation on record. Similarly, the share of prime working age Americans in jobs or looking for work is higher now than it was in almost the entire decade before the pandemic began – and has recovered more of the lost ground than at this time in the last two downturns.

Moreover, the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low at the end of 2022, with the unemployment rate near record lows for African-Americans and Hispanics and at the lowest rate in history for people with disabilities. In the context of this uniquely strong labor market, wages have gone up the most for lower- and middle income workers.

This progress was far from pre-ordained – it was driven by decisive policy action to get Americans back to work. Before the passage of the American Rescue Plan, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the unemployment rate would be 4.9% in the final quarter of 2022, rather than the 3.5% it actually reached.

The policy priority on driving a strong labor market recovery was grounded in decades of economic research showing that long spells of unemployment have severe and long-lasting “scarring” impacts on workers, families, and communities: long-term unemployment makes it harder to find future jobs or acquire new skills; it drives higher rates of depression and substance abuse; it puts financial distress on families; and it has devastating educational and economic effects on children. It is particularly noteworthy, in this context, that long term unemployment is down by more than 3 million people from its March 2021 peak, and is currently well below its 2010-2019 average.

Throughout this period, the Administration has also taken direct action – through the National Labor Relations Board and the President’s Task Force on Union Organizing and Worker Empowerment – to promote the strength of unions. In part as a result, petitions for union representation elections were up 53% in the private sector in 2022.

Accelerate the Federal Government’s response to end the COVID-19 pandemic

“Our rescue plan starts aggressively in order to speed up our national COVID-19 response.”

The President identified early on that economic recovery was inextricably tied to ending the COVID-19 pandemic’s grip on our economy and our lives. To safely put Americans back to work, we had to rapidly develop and deploy vaccines, increase testing access, and reopen our schools and businesses. He also recognized that pandemic conditions were highly uncertain, and we needed to prepare for risks were at the time unknown but ultimately materialized, like the Delta and Omicron variants.

Two years later, COVID deaths are down over 80%. Vaccines, treatments like Paxlovid, and testing are ubiquitously available; and our schools and businesses are open again. We are far better positioned to deal with surges and new variants than before.

All the while, the President has worked to limit the potential economic disruptions from the pandemic – shortages of essential products like medicine and food, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line healthcare workers and the general public, and shortages and disruptions that arose across the economy due to global pandemic-oriented supply chain challenges.

The Administration, for example, brought business and labor together to broker an agreement to move ports to 24/7 operations, which has helped increase goods movement through the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach by 24% above pre-pandemic record levels, while bringing goods transportation prices down. The Administration launched a Trucking Action Plan to increase the supply of truck drivers in good jobs, which helped to double the number of new commercial driver’s licenses issued. The Administration also worked with Congress to pass the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, lowering costs for consumers. As of December, a leading index of supply chain pressures showed that more than 70% of pandemic-oriented supply chain pressures had eased.

Help American households avoid the worst economic outcomes associated with downturns

“Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans, hardest hit, and most in need… It will also provide more peace of mind for struggling families… And as we work to keep people from going hungry, we’ll also work to keep a roof over their heads, to stem the growing housing crisis and evictions that are looming.”

Part of the logic behind bold action to spur a rapid labor market recovery and provide relief to households was the necessity of helping households avoid some of the most negative economic outcomes that are often associated with downturns – things like evictions and foreclosures, bankruptcies, and loss of health care coverage.

As shown below, financial security for households on a range of measures is not only better than it was during the depths of the pandemic, but, critically, measures of financial security have also generally improved compared to both pre-pandemic levels and averages from 2010-20191. Because of policies President Biden has signed into law, we have reduced health care costs and expanded access – leading to the lowest uninsured rate on record in 2022. In other words, because of focused and decisive policy action, households are coming out of the pandemic better off than before on key metrics of economic security – something that typically takes years to happen after economic downturns. And while inflation has undoubtedly posed challenges to economic security, wages increased faster than inflation in the second half of 2022 – as gas prices declined substantially, core inflation moderated, and the labor market remained strong – providing further tangible economic benefit to workers and families.

Give small business the support they need and spur renewed entrepreneurship

“Our rescue plan will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth, our economy as a whole, the glue that holds communities together as well.”

The President knows that small businesses are engines of economic growth and employment in communities throughout the country. Over the last two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided billions of dollars in pandemic relief, investment, lending, and technical assistance to level the playing field and allow small businesses to thrive.

Beyond helping small businesses stay afloat, the Biden economic agenda has also helped drive an unprecedented surge in entrepreneurship. Just this week, new data show that over the last two years, Americans have applied to start 10.5 million new businesses, the strongest two years on record. In 2022, Americans applied to start 5 million new businesses, the second most on record only behind the 5.4 million applicants filed in 2021.

Each of these new small businesses is an act of optimism – people everywhere in the country are putting their own money and their own lives into something new, and they’re doing it in record numbers.

Jumpstart the economy while avoiding the long-term damage to debt and deficits

“It’s not just that smart fiscal investments, including deficit spending, are more urgent than ever, it’s that the return on these investments in jobs, racial equity, will prevent long-term economic damage and the benefits will far surpass the cost.”

The President-elect noted in his speech that the Rescue Plan he proposed wouldn’t just be good for our economy and workers, but it was also the smart thing to do from a fiscal standpoint: that by passing the Rescue Plan, we could jumpstart the economy and avoid the long-term damage to debt and deficits that are associated with slow recoveries, low tax receipts, and prolonged emergency spending.

In the last two years, in addition to the substantial economic benefits stemming from the historically strong recovery, we have also seen significant deficit reduction – as the Rescue Plan facilitated a strong economic recovery and enabled the responsible wind-down of emergency spending programs. Building on this fiscal progress, the President last year signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes historic progress on reducing energy and health care costs while reducing the deficit by more than $200 billion over the next decade.

Make long-overdue investments in America’s infrastructure

“It’s time to stop talking about infrastructure and to finally start building an infrastructure so we can be more competitive. Millions of good paying jobs that put Americans to work, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, to make them more climate resilient, to make them faster, cheaper, cleaner to transport American made goods across our country and around the world. That’s how we compete.”

While policymakers for decades have called for investment to revitalize American infrastructure, President Biden worked to bring together Democrats and Republicans to pass the largest investment in infrastructure since we built the interstate highway system. Already, the Biden Administration has launched $185 billion in infrastructure projects, including funding for 6,900 projects, reaching over 4,000 communities across all 50 states, D.C., and the territories. From our roads and bridges to rail, public transit, and the first nationwide network of electrical vehicle chargers to universal high-speed internet, the Biden economic agenda is enabling the kinds of infrastructure investments that economists have long argued would boost economic capacity and crowd-in private investment.

Support for the future of clean energy, manufacturing, and innovation

“American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. It will be so again. Imagine a future made in America, all made in America and all by Americans. We’ll use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America. We’ll buy American products, supporting millions of American manufacturing jobs, enhancing our competitive strength in an increasingly competitive world.”

“Imagine historic investments in research and development to sharpen America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like the battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. Imagine confronting the climate crisis with American jobs and ingenuity leading the world.”

Building on the strongest two years of manufacturing job growth in 40 years, the President signed the most significant investment in manufacturing, science, innovation, and industrial strategy in over 50 years. And he then signed the largest public investment in the clean energy transition in U.S. history.

Already, private companies have invested nearly $300 billion in locating manufacturing in the United States – from the Rust Belt to the Southwest – ranging from semiconductors to lithium batteries to clean energy production to electric vehicle manufacturing. Many companies have cited incentives and investments signed into law by President Biden as key reasons for their investments. And critically, many of these investments are in communities that have experienced disinvestment in recent years or are geared towards workers without college degrees – whose labor force participation has mostly declined over the last two decades. In other words, these investments can help our economy thrive over the long-run by raising economic potential, promoting resilience, and limiting future harms associated with climate change.

Reform the tax code so the wealthy and large corporation pay their fair share

“As I said on the campaign trail, we will pay for [these investments] by making sure that everyone pays their fair share, not [by] punishing anybody… It’s the right thing for our economy. It’s the fair thing. It’s the decent thing to do.”

As President Biden came into office, he highlighted the need to reform the tax system so that high-income people and corporations pay their fair share. The 2017 tax law only made an unfair tax system worse, and decades of underfunding for tax enforcement meant that the wealthy and large corporations were able to evade their taxes, even as middle-class workers paid the taxes they owed.

Since then, President Biden has signed multiple revenue enhancing tax provisions that will allow us to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to fund critical national priorities that promote economic growth, while making our tax system more equitable.

One is an investment that will allow the U.S. government to crack down on wealthy tax cheats and improve taxpayer services. Working people pay 99% of the taxes they owe, while the top 1%hides about 20% of their income from tax, including by funneling it through offshore accounts in tax havens that don’t report earnings. The investment President Biden signed into law will reduce the deficit by more than $100 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. None of the resources will be used to increase audit rates relative to historical levels for small businesses or households with incomes below $400,000; in fact, middle-class taxpayers will see more timely refunds and other service improvements because of these resources.

Another is a 15 percent minimum tax on the corporate profits that large corporations—those with over $1 billion in profits—report to shareholders. This new corporate minimum tax increases taxes only on the large companies that are reporting high profits but paying little to no tax, leveling the playing field for companies that are already paying their fair share.

In addition to these legislative accomplishments, the Administration has made substantial strides in working towards a global minimum tax on corporations. The Administration’s leadership has been critical in working to end the global race to the bottom on corporate taxation, which places a higher tax burden on workers and deprives governments around the world – including the United States – of the ability to raise sufficient tax revenue to invest in economic growth.

When President-elect Biden addressed the nation two years ago, he said he believed that if Congress passed his agenda, we would “come out better off than when we went into the crisis.” Two years later, we can now say that we have done so.

The President’s economic plan has laid the foundation for a bottom-up and middle-out recovery – one of the strongest and most equitable economic recoveries in history. This historic recovery – and legislation the President has signed to address longstanding affordability challenges – has set the stage for a transition to steady, stable growth, with lower inflation, even as we keep our job market resilient. Going forward, we need to build on this progress – by lowering the cost of care to help more parents work; by investing in education and skills training, particularly for those without a college degree; and by investing in children and lowering child poverty in America.

Of course, we face a range of economic risks – from geopolitical uncertainty to the potential for reckless extremism around the full faith and credit of the United States. But two years in, because of the resilience of the American people and the economic policies we have pursued, we are better positioned than we have been in decades to achieve durable, resilient, and inclusive long-run growth that we too often failed to achieve before the crisis."

President Biden has denied the damage his Bidenomics blueprint of reckless spending, anti-American energy policies, and sweeping regulations have caused for the economy and American households’ budgets. Chairman Fallon emphasized the need for transparency about how Bidenomics has damaged our fiscal and national security and what we must do instead to get the economy growing again.

Below are Subcommittee Chairman Fallon’s remarks as prepared for delivery.

Today’s hearing is an opportunity to discuss an issue every household in America is familiar with—the clear failure of “Bidenomics” and the crisis caused through the Biden Administration’s reckless spending.

Joe Biden likes to say that “Bidenomics is just another way of saying, ‘Restoring the American Dream.”

But just last week, the Consumer Price Index showed prices have risen 17.4% since Joe Biden took office. That means 26 months of consumers watching their paychecks disappear before their very eyes due to the rising cost of living.

Worse yet, mortgage rates have nearly doubled since Joe Biden took office, making it much harder for Americans to buy a new home.

That is not the American Dream.

Joe Biden likes to say that Bidenomics is about “building from the middle out and the bottom up.”

But those hurt most by the rising prices are low-income households and seniors relying on Social Security for their monthly retirement income.

Wage growth has fallen behind the pace of inflation in 20 of the past 22 months, and most Americans are now unable to pay for a surprise expense of $400 without going into debt.

That is not building from the middle out and the bottom up.

Joe Biden likes to remind us he promised not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year. But as of June 2023, the average worker was paying an “inflation tax” of 13.5%—effectively a second federal income tax.

The truth is, Bidenomics has been a disaster, and the American people know it.

A recent poll found that 80 percent of Americans credit Joe Biden’s policies for the current state of the economy and 70 percent agreed that their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation.

Our current economic track is nothing short of unsustainable, yet the Biden Administration could not be less concerned.

In fact, Joe Biden considers the current environment a huge success—proudly taking credit for every failed business that couldn’t stay afloat under his crushing regulatory regime, or the parent forced to pay bills with a credit card and going into debt because their wages were not keeping pace with inflation.

According to Joe Biden, we’re supposed to believe that we’re actually better off than we were at the start of his administration. But the facts tell a very different story.

The pain households are experiencing can be tied directly back to disastrous policies pushed by this Administration.

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency spending made sense—the country was thrown into a tailspin and we had to ensure that our entire economy did not capsize.

However, the Biden Administration plowed forward maintaining these “wartime” spending levels long after that spending was necessary. It’s been said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste,” and the Administration could not have taken this more literally.

From the “American Rescue Plan” to the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the Biden Administration has wasted no time throwing mind-boggling amounts of money at various crises of their choosing with seemingly no regard for the consequences.

The Biden Administration apparently doesn’t care if a gallon of milk costs $6, so long as they can force everyone to purchase an electric vehicle that costs more than the yearly median household income.

Decades ago, Republicans banded together through the “Contract with America” to bring about some of the most impactful economic reforms seen in generations.

By combining a series of targeted, fiscally conservative policies into one unified agenda, House Republicans paved the way for Americans everywhere to prosper.

We have already seen the blueprint for what works, and we can achieve that success again.

We have also seen the blueprint for what does not work, thanks to Bidenomics and the anti-growth policies of this Administration.

I thank our witnesses for appearing before the Committee today and I look forward to a thoughtful discussion."

Story Highlights 37% approve, 59% disapprove of Biden, unchanged from last month’s ratings

32% approve of Biden’s handling of foreign affairs, economy, Middle East conflict

Democrats’ ratings of Biden worst for the Middle East conflict

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Joe Biden’s job approval rating remains at 37%, tying his personal low, with disapproval at 59%. Approval ratings of the president’s handling of healthcare (40%) and the situation in Ukraine (38%) are similar to his overall rating, while fewer, 32% each, approve of his handling of the economy, foreign affairs, and the situation between the Israelis and Palestinians.

###Embeddable###

Gallup’s Nov. 1-21 poll marks the third time Biden’s overall job approval rating has been at 37%. All three instances have occurred in 2023 -- the first in April and the second in October. Biden’s job rating has not risen above 44% since August 2022 and has averaged 40% this year.

###Embeddable###

Gallup has measured Biden’s ratings on the economy and foreign affairs 10 times since he took office in 2021, and his ratings on the two issues have followed similar trajectories. Yet, in 2022, when inflation was at a 40-year high, and earlier this year, Biden’s foreign affairs ratings were significantly better than his economic ratings.

Biden’s current rating on the economy is just one percentage point higher than his lowest in 2022, while his foreign affairs rating is the lowest by six points.

###Embeddable###

Biden continues to navigate the United States’ role in wars between the Israelis and Palestinians and Russia and Ukraine, and he garners weak ratings for his handling of each. Americans’ current rating of the president’s handling of the situation in Ukraine is the lowest of four taken by Gallup and is down nine points since August.

The latest poll marks the first time Gallup has asked about Biden’s handling of the situation in the Middle East that erupted when Hamas militants invaded Israel on Oct. 7.

Democrats’ Ratings of Biden Worst on Middle East Conflict

While majorities of Democrats approve of Biden’s overall job performance and his handling of all five issues, their approval is lowest for the situation between the Israelis and Palestinians. In all, 60% of Democrats approve of his handling of the conflict, reflecting intraparty tensions over Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas versus prioritizing the safety of Palestinian civilians. A separate question in the poll finds that 36% of Democrats approve of Israel’s military action against Hamas.

Meanwhile, two-thirds of Democrats approve of Biden’s job on foreign affairs, and roughly three-quarters each approve of his handling of the economy, healthcare policy and the situation in Ukraine. At the same time, no more than 16% of Republicans or 35% of independents approve of Biden’s handling of any of the issues. Republicans are most approving of Biden’s handling of the Middle East situation, while independents give him his best marks on healthcare policy.

More than four in five Democrats, 83%, approve of Biden’s overall job performance, compared with 5% of Republicans and 27% of independents.

Biden Approval Recovers Among Democrats but Falters Among Independents

After dropping 11 points last month, Democrats’ latest approval rating of Biden has rebounded and is up eight points to 83%. Still, it falls short of the nearly unanimous approval Biden enjoyed from his party during the first 11 months of his presidency.

Meanwhile, Biden’s approval rating from political independents has dropped eight points over the past month to a record-low 27% for that group, while he continues to earn minimal approval, just 5%, from Republicans.

Bottom Line

With less than a year to go until the presidential election, Biden continues to receive tepid ratings from the American public. His overall job approval rating is still at his personal low and is in historically dangerous territory for an incumbent seeking reelection. In addition, political independents’ record-low rating of Biden is striking. Biden’s even weaker ratings on the economy, foreign affairs and the Middle East suggest that his performance in these areas is dragging down his overall job performance rating.

Here's why

The economy's good. The economy's bad.

It depends on who you ask — and increasingly which party is in the White House when you ask.

It was yet another strong jobs report Friday, exceeding expectations. Almost 200,000 jobs were created last month and unemployment dropped to 3.7%, which is near full employment.

People are also spending at a record rate this holiday shopping season — 200 million people shopped between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, higher than expectations and the most ever.

They spent a record $38 billion on holiday items during that short stretch, up 8% from a year ago.

And they're expected to spend nearly $1 trillion holiday shopping this year, according to the National Retail Federation.

Despite all that, pessimism about the economy reigns.

Both Gallup and the Pew Research Center found just 1 in 5 rated the economy as either excellent or good.

Inflation, which has led to higher grocery and gas bills than Americans would like, is partially to blame for souring their moods. But there's more going on here.

There is a huge divide by party on the question of the economy, and there's a stark switch that's been taking place when there's a new administration. And this party-line view of the economy is particularly noticeable among Republicans.

For example, according to Pew, in 2016 when former President Obama, a Democrat, was in office, just 18% of Republicans thought the economy was either good or excellent.

But in 2020, with Trump, a Republican, in office, that jumped to a whopping 81%. And this year, with Biden in the White House, Republicans' positive views of the economy tanked to just 10%.

Sure, inflation went up, but economics alone doesn't cause that kind of whiplash.

Consider: During Obama's tenure, the economy was still recovering from the Great Recession, but unemployment by the time Obama left office was at 4.7%. By February 2020, just before the pandemic hit, unemployment dropped to 3.5%, a decline to be sure, but not to the extreme that would explain Republicans' 63-point increase under Trump when inflation was flat.

Democrats were more optimistic about the economy during the recent Democratic presidencies, but not to the extent of Republicans' wild swings.

In 2016, 46% of Democrats had a more positive than negative view of the economy, according to Pew. In 2020 under Trump, Democrats grew more pessimistic, but only by 7 points.

In 2023, they declined further to 28% — still 18 points higher than Republicans, but nowhere near as bullish as Republicans were under Trump.

But the pessimism can't be dismissed as simply politics

While Republicans have had sharper changes in economic outlook and a lot of that may be politics, the fact that Democrats have also declined in their views of the economy does show that it's not all about politics.

The fact is inflation is one of those things people can see — they see it on massive signs at gas stations and on their grocery bills. Overall inflation after the pandemic began to rise and hit a high of 9.1% in June of last year. But food inflation was an even higher 11.4% last summer.

That meant that things like steak, bacon, eggs, cheese, potato chips, coffee, ice cream and cookies were more expensive. All are household items and noticeable every time someone checks out at the store.

Overall inflation and food inflation have both come down significantly since the start of the year, from 6.4% overall to 3.2% in October and from 10.1% to 3.3% for food.

There's been an especially sharp decline in food inflation since the summer, but that hasn't necessarily meant prices have come down much, if at all, and Biden isn't seeing any political benefit — 67% disapproved of Biden's handling of the economy in the latest Gallup survey, which is similar to other recent polls' findings.

Housing costs in many parts of the country remain high, and one of the reasons for inflation coming down is because the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates substantially, making the ability to afford a home significantly more difficult.

The economy, but more specifically how much stuff costs, is always going to be top of mind for voters. And there's no easy solution politically.

Biden and his campaign team have to hope that inflation continues to recede, the Fed starts to lower rates, and people feel a loosening of the pinch on their wallets in an election year, because right now this issue makes Biden especially vulnerable for reelection.

306,People Aren't Crazy for Thinking the Biden Economy Is Bad - Jacobin magazine,People Aren't Crazy for Thinking the Biden Economy Is Bad  Jacobin magazine,"Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9iaWRlbi1lY29ub215LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLW9waW5pb24tcG9sbGluZy1tZXRyaWNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Jacobin magazine,"I have been closely monitoring the recent discourse on the goodness of the economy, and I think I’ve fully mapped it out and understand why it keeps breaking down. What is being presented as an argument about one question is actually an argument about three different questions:

Is the economy good? Did Joe Biden do a good job with the economy given political constraints? Why do people say the economy is bad when asked by survey takers?

Each of these questions is interesting when analyzed separately. But when you mush them together without realizing you are doing that, you end up in a rhetorical quagmire that causes frustration and confusion.

My interest in the debate is mostly on question number one, i.e. whether the economy is good. When I was introduced to this discourse, this seemed to be what people were arguing about, with the consensus sentiment from liberal thought-leaders being that the economy is not only good, but is extremely good, and that any viewpoint to the contrary is bad faith, borderline insane, or factually bankrupt.

I found this peculiar, because whether the economy is good or bad is, at minimum, a highly contestable question that turns as much on your ideological views about what makes an economy good as it does on various factual indicators.

If we take a snapshot of the current economy and ask whether it is good or bad, certainly anyone with conventional leftist views on economics would say that it is bad. The welfare state is bad. Unionization is low. Public ownership is low. Inequality is high.

This negative assessment is not based on some pie-in-the-sky baseline for a good economy either: we hugely trail many of our developed-nation peers on those metrics. Nor is this baseline being opportunistically selected: the Left spent five years lining up behind a Bernie Sanders campaign that had as its core premise that an economy that looks like what we have right now is really awful.

If we look only at recent changes in the economy, what we see is a very mixed bag. On the one hand, the recovery from the COVID recession has increased employment and compressed the wage schedule, both good things. On the other hand, the rollback of the COVID welfare state has seen free school meals eliminated, cash benefits for the poorest kids eliminated, ten million people kicked off Medicaid, and the return of our completely dysfunctional unemployment benefit system, all bad things.

The question of how exactly to combine these conflicting developments to generate a net assessment of recent changes presents the usual incommensurability problems and therefore heated debate. My simple attempt to net this all out by looking at recent developments in disposable income is presented in the graph below. This disposable income concept includes labor market and welfare state developments in it, but it does not fully settle the debate either.

As I have proliferated this argument over the past few weeks, what I have found is that people respond by changing the subject to questions two and three. So they acknowledge that obviously social democrats must think the current economy is bad and must think that these recent welfare cuts were bad, but then say either that these things are not Biden’s fault or that survey respondents who say the economy is bad are doing so for other reasons.

These latter two questions are of much less interest to me, in large part because there is no real good way to argue about them.

The genius of a government with so many veto points is that it’s impossible to assign blame or credit to anyone for almost anything because no single person or government body is a sufficient cause of most government actions. In practice what this means is that partisans credit the president for everything that passes even though he cannot unilaterally pass anything, but do not blame him for anything that fails to pass because, after all, he cannot unilaterally pass anything.

As to what motivates survey respondents, it’s clear enough that a lot of survey responding is “expressive” in the sense that people don’t attempt to answer the question that is presented to them but instead, consciously or subconsciously, use the question as a proxy for things like “do you like the president” or “how do you feel about the state of the country” or similar. The funniest example of this I have seen is that, shortly after Biden was elected, the percent of Democratic survey respondents who said they felt financially comfortable buying a new refrigerator massively shot up.

A couple of years ago, it became popular to dismiss polling that showed people liked progressive ideas by saying it was unreliable. But weirdly those taking that position presented as their alternative other polling that worded questions about these ideas differently in order to generate more negative responses. Now it seems maybe they are finally coming around to the more natural conclusion that topical polling is itself meaningless, not just when it shows support for public health insurance.

In any case, as interesting as questions about Biden’s culpability and survey behavior are, it is important not to conceptually muddle them with the question of whether the economy is good. Proving that Biden did the best he can and that survey respondents are stupid or expressive does not actually prove that the economy is good. By conventional social democratic measures, the economy is bad, and recent trends in the economy have been mixed at best. Any conclusion to the contrary is therefore based on ideological, not factual, disagreement."

President Joe Biden is leaning into the political branding ""Bidenomics"" as his 2024 reelection effort kicks into high gear.

He and top advisers renewed their push to keep improving economic news and his overall sprawling vision in the public eye with a stop Thursday in the swing state of South Carolina as part of an ""Investing in America"" tour.

There, he announced clean energy investments that will create 1,800 jobs nationwide.

""Our plan is working,"" Biden said. ""And one of the things I'm proudest of is it's working everywhere.""

The fresh messaging comes as the administration has been buoyed by positive numbers on inflation, unemployment and more.

The state of the economy and how it affects Americans personally is traditionally a key -- if not the most important -- issue for voters. But their perceptions can lag behind the numbers and many remain unconvinced Biden has done a good job handling the economy, polls show, while Republicans are hitting him on it at every turn on the campaign trail.

""There's been this unprecedented gap between what the data shows us is going on in the economy and what people think is going on in the economy,"" Heidi Shierholz, president of the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, told ABC News.

Improving economic picture

Inflation has dropped for 11 straight months, from its peak of 9.1% in June of last year to 4.0% in May. Unemployment stands at 3.7%, which is a near 50-year low, and 13 million jobs have been added since Biden took office.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week praised the resiliency of the U.S. economy, and said while a recession is still possible it's not the most likely case.

""Over the last year, things have turned out a lot better than a lot of economists thought it would,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News.

The White House, in addition to touting the above economic indicators, is pushing three major pieces of legislation passed under Biden they say will reinvigorate America’s economy over the next decade: the Chips and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

A new report from the Treasury Department highlighted manufacturing construction spending has doubled since the end of 2021 and the passage of the bills.

""For the first time in a long time, there's enthusiasm about building high-tech factories in the United States,"" said Brad Setser, a former trade and Treasury official in the Biden and Obama administrations.

Despite the progress, Biden remains underwater with voters when it comes to the economy. One recent poll from ABC News and the Washington Post found Americans 54-36% said former President Donald Trump did a better job handling the economy when he was in office than Biden's done so far.

Why voters remain unconvinced

One major reason why voters may not be giving Biden credit, economists said, is that inflation is still uncomfortably high and wages have only just started to keep up with price hikes. Powell said last week the target inflation rate of 2% is not expected to be reached until 2025, and more interest rate hikes could be in store to bring that data point down.

""It's painfully high,"" Zandi said of inflation. ""It's moderating but still people are having to shell out more of their income to maintain their purchasing power.""

Political observers also noted bad economic news, such as when gas prices rose to over $5 a gallon or inflation reached a 40-year high, is often more salient in the news and to voters than good economic news.

Republicans have been united in bashing Biden on that front, accusing him of stoking inflation with large spending packages and hurting companies through ""woke"" policies.

So far, Democrats have produced a weaker counterpunch, said Dean Baker, the co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

""The Democrats have been much less effective in focusing on a message and getting everyone to repeat it,"" Baker told ABC News. ""For better or worse, Republicans largely do that. So I think Biden has an uphill battle, but I think he does have a very good story to sell.""

Is the 'Bidenomics' pitch a gamble?

Biden will continue to talk economy on Friday when he announces new actions to lower health care costs and fight junk fees.

The messaging push, however, isn't without risk.

One of the most important questions moving forward, according to political scientist John Sides, is whether inflation continues to cool and real wages grow without economic contraction.

""If those economic trends continue, I would expect news coverage of the economy to become more positive and I would expect consumer confidence to increase,"" Sides told ABC News. ""I would expect Biden's approval rating to rise as well. That would make his reelection more likely, even if his approval rating isn't 'high' in absolute terms. It would also become more difficult for his opponent to center a campaign on economic fundamentals.""

But should the economy worsen, Sides said Biden should ""certainly focus on a different issue.""

""The moment to make that decision would be in the first few months of 2024,"" Sides said. ""Election-year trends in the economy are the most important to voters, so what happens in 2024 will be crucial for Biden's strategy and his reelection prospects."""

This is the first phase of the new Tech Hubs program, which is an economic development initiative designed to drive regional innovation and job creation by strengthening a region’s capacity to manufacture, commercialize, and deploy technology that will advance American competitiveness. The program invests directly in burgeoning, high-potential U.S. regions and aims to transform them into globally competitive innovation centers.

Tech Hubs was authorized by the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, a key part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which he signed into law in August 2022.

These Tech Hubs are located across 32 states and Puerto Rico, and represent a cross-section of urban and rural regions. Designation is an endorsement of the region’s plans to supercharge their respective technological industries to create jobs, strengthen U.S. competitiveness, and protect national security. The Tech Hubs announced today focus on industries ranging from autonomous systems, quantum computing, biotechnology, precision medicine, clean energy advancement, semiconductor manufacturing, and more, and highlight how the Biden Harris Administration is investing in innovation and economic growth in every region of the United States.

EDA also awarded 29 Strategy Development Grants (SDG) to help communities significantly increase local coordination and planning activities. Such development could make selected grantees more competitive for future Tech Hubs funding opportunities.

“President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is rooted in policies that will empower the United States to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world. Our Tech Hubs Program is fundamental to that mission and will supercharge innovation across the nation by spurring cutting-edge technological investments and creating 21st century job opportunities in people’s backyards,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Each of these consortia will help us ensure the industries of the future—and their good-paying jobs—start, grow, and remain in the United States.”

“Innovation, cutting-edge research, and creativity can be found in every community across America. Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda, the Tech Hubs program is seizing that potential and investing in regional consortia that will boost U.S. manufacturing, create more good-paying jobs and bolster U.S. global competitiveness,” said Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves. “The phase 1 designees and grant recipients reflect the diverse technological industries growing here at home and are symbols of American innovation and opportunity. The Tech Hubs program will provide them tools and resources to drive economic growth across the nation, which Americans will feel for generations to come.”

“President Biden’s Tech Hubs program will catalyze technological advances in communities across America, laying the foundations for future centers of world class innovation, manufacturing, and good paying jobs,” said Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard.

The Phase 1 winners were selected from nearly 400 applications from regional consortia that include industry, academia, state and local governments, economic development organizations, and labor and workforce partners. As part of the Tech Hubs competition, each consortium outlined plans for strengthening its region’s capacity to manufacture, commercialize, and deploy critical technologies.

“These outstanding Tech Hubs Designees exemplify place-based economic development strategies at their best: combining federal resources with regional assets, expertise, and coalitions to implement transformational opportunities, said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo. “As each region develops its own strategy to catalyze innovation and job creation, the entire nation grows more secure and more competitive.”

Today, the Department of Commerce launched a second Tech Hubs Notice of Funding Opportunity, allowing these designated Tech Hubs to apply to receive between $40 million and $70 million each for implementation funding, totaling nearly $500 million.

The Tech Hubs designees are:

The US has roared back from the Covid recession by official measures. But two-thirds of Americans are unhappy about the economy despite consistent reports that inflation is easing and unemployment is close to a 50-year low. And the poll suggests many are unaware of or don’t believe the positive economic news the government has reported.

The results illustrate a dramatic political split on economic views – with Republicans far more pessimistic than Democrats. But unhappiness about the economy is widespread.

Two-thirds of respondents (68%) reported it’s difficult to be happy about positive economic news when they feel financially squeezed each month (Republicans: 69%, Democrats: 68%).

Two-thirds of Americans (65%) believe that the economy is worse than the media makes it out to be rather than better (35%).

In August the unemployment rate was 3.8%, close to a 50-year low. But the poll found that 51% wrongly believe that unemployment is nearing a 50-year high rather than those who believe it’s actually low (49%).

The lack of confidence in the economy has many academics and politicians puzzled. Some have blamed the US’s polarized politics and this was illustrated in the poll. But Harris’s data also shows that fears are widespread – and reinforced by disbelief of or ignorance about official figures and a mistrust of the media’s reporting of them.

Some 82% of Republicans and 66% of independents believe the economy is worse than the media’s portrayal. But nearly half of Democrats (49%) also said the media viewed the economy too favorably.

Overall, the poll found widespread despondency about the state of the economy. More than half of Americans (53%) believe the economy is getting worse instead of better or staying the same. Republicans and independents are more likely to think it’s getting worse (72% and 58%, respectively, v Democrats: 32%), while more Democrats think it’s getting better (32% v Republicans: 8%, independents: 13%).

The results paint a difficult picture for Joe Biden, who is making “Bidenomics” – his economic policy record – a central plank of his re-election platform.

The views of those familiar with Bidenomics showed a perhaps unsurprising party split. Some 60% of Democrats believe his plans are improving the US economy overall compared with 12% of Republicans.

There is a widespread belief that Bidenomics is good in theory but isn’t being implemented well – something both Democrats and Republicans agree with (62% v 58%).

Biden supporters have just launched a $13m advertising campaign extolling the president’s economic achievements, which include a landmark $1.2tn infrastructure and climate bill, massive investment in domestic microchips production and green energy solutions. His legislative actions are predicted to create 1.5m jobs per year for the next decade.

That message may be hard to sell given the widespread disbelief of and ignorance about the health of the US economy highlighted by the poll.

As well as being wrong about the unemployment data, respondents were unaware of, or chose to mischaracterize, other major economic data points.

The widest measure of economic growth – gross domestic product – increased at a 2.1% annualized rate last quarter and has been steadily improving since the Covid downturn. But more respondents (59%) believe that the US economy is shrinking this year than those who believe it is growing (41%). More Republicans (72%) and independents (63%) believe the economy is shrinking than do Democrats. But still, a sizeable 44% of Democrats believe the economy is shrinking.

The S&P 500 stock market index is up 16% so far this year. But 59% of respondents wrongly said they believe the S&P is down for the year compared with those who said they believe it is up (41%). The majority of all those asked said the S&P was down whether Republican (66%), independent (60%) or Democrat (52%).

US wages are, finally, growing faster than inflation. But 75% of those polled wrongfully believe that wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. That view is held by the majority of Republicans (84%), independents (75%) and Democrats (67%).

There was some good news for Biden. The poll found that 75% of respondents support at least one of the four main branches of Bidenomics: improving infrastructure, attracting high-tech electronics manufacturing, building clean energy manufacturing facilities and attracting more high-paying union jobs.

Still, 51% of Americans believe that government spending under the current administration is having a negative impact on the US economy (Republicans: 72%, independents: 54%, Democrats: 30%) rather than a positive impact (21%) or no impact (28%). And only just over a third of Democrats (35%) believe it’s having a positive impact (Republicans: 11%, independents: 16%).

“All these perceptual-reality gaps underscore Biden’s difficulty in claiming credit for economic gains. Americans either view the economy through their politics or aren’t feeling it in real life, or both,” said John Gerzema, the CEO of Harris Poll."

Funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the H2Hubs program will help form the foundation of a national clean hydrogen network vital to reducing emissions from some of the most energy-intensive sectors of our economy, including industrial and chemical processes and heavy-duty transportation. Today’s announcement will help ensure both producers and end users in the H2Hubs have the market certainty they need during the early years of production to unlock private investment and realize the full potential of clean hydrogen. Achieving commercial-scale clean hydrogen deployment is critical to creating good-paying jobs and new economic opportunities in communities across the nation while also enabling our long-term decarbonization objectives.

“Ensuring America is the global leader in the next generation of clean energy technologies requires all of us — government and industry — coming together to confront shared challenges, particularly lack of market certainty for clean hydrogen that too often delays progress,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “That’s why DOE is setting up a new initiative to help our private sector partners address bottlenecks and other project impediments — helping industry unlock the full potential of this incredibly versatile energy resource and supporting the long-term success of the H2hubs.”

Clean hydrogen — a versatile and flexible energy carrier that can be produced with low or zero carbon emissions — offers substantial economic benefits and will help create tens of thousands of new, good-paying jobs across the country, particularly in underserved and energy communities. According to DOE’s Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Clean Hydrogen report, America’s growing hydrogen economy has the potential to add 100,000 net new direct and indirect jobs by 2030. By enabling the development of diverse, domestic clean energy pathways across multiple sectors of the economy, clean hydrogen will strengthen American energy independence and accelerate the American manufacturing boom that has already created over 800,000 jobs since President Biden took office.

Developing a hydrogen demand-side initiative is critical to ensuring the early commercial viability of a H2Hub given that demand formation for a new energy source typically lags creation of reliable supply. This new initiative will support the growth and sustainability of the H2Hubs program by providing the revenue certainty that hydrogen producers require to attract private sector investment. It will also help meet the needs of end users who often prefer the flexibility to purchase hydrogen on shorter-term contracts and require confidence in the long-term availability of clean hydrogen before making critical, long-term investments.

The NOI, which includes a Request for Information on the program’s design, will help DOE refine and validate its approach to provide demand-side support for the hubs to enter the clean hydrogen market and will identify the best approach to engaging and potentially involving private sector institutions in the organization, capitalization, and execution of the implementing entity’s mandate. To help inform the design of a demand-side support mechanism for the H2Hubs program, the NOI seeks public input on potential benefits and risks, operating models, governance structures, and equipped implementing partners. The NOI is also informed by DOE’s dialogue with the energy industry, clean energy investment firms, nonprofit entities, non-governmental organizations, and public response from the demand-side request for information issued in spring 2022 and from DOE’s Pathways to Commercial Liftoff Report on clean hydrogen. Based on demonstrated performance and experience gained with the H2Hubs demand-side support mechanism, DOE may consider similar mechanisms for other technologies and clean energy products in the future.

Funded by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and managed by DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations with support from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the H2Hubs are a critical component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s deep commitment to invest in America’s workforce, jumpstart local economic growth, and create good-paying jobs while strengthening America’s role as a clean energy leader.

Later this year, the Biden-Harris Administration will announce the selection of six to 10 H2Hubs for a combined total funding of up to $7 billion in federal funding—one of the most historic clean energy investments in history and a cornerstone of President Biden’s vision to achieve carbon-free grid by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050. The proposed mechanism outlined in the NOI will help connect the H2Hubs to prospective purchasers — providing durable demand and sufficient customers for the Hubs while also supporting President Biden’s whole-of-government approach to building a strong clean hydrogen economy.

What’s the biggest problem with the US economy right now? The vibes are off.

By almost any objective measure, Americans are doing much better economically than they were nearly three years ago, when President Joe Biden took office. Still, a majority — 58% — say Biden’s policies have made economic conditions worse, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.

That’s up from 50% a year ago.

But the grim outlook is at odds with the hard data, which reveal an economy bursting with optimism.

“Has the economy improved under Joe Biden? There’s literally no question,” said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan.

In January 2021, the start of Biden’s term, “everything sucked,” according to Wolfers. Unemployment was at 6.3% and the economy had yet to rebound from the shock of Covid-19. Wolfers described that time as “one of the worst economic moments of my life.”

Two and a half years later, the US economy is in a much healthier spot.

Unemployment has been hovering near its lowest level in a half-century — roughly 3.5% — for the past 18 months. August marked the 32nd consecutive month of job growth. Real wages (meaning adjusted for inflation) are rising. That’s helped everyone feel confident about continuing to spend money, which keeps the US economic engine humming.

Put another way: People are spending like they’re in a good mood, even if they say they’re not.

“There’s this disjunction between reality and perception that’s as large as I’ve ever seen in my career,” Wolfers told CNN. “If you’d fallen asleep in 2019 and woke up in 2023, you would discover pretty much the sort of economy you would have expected.”

So, why the sour mood?

In short: Inflation, housing and bitter national politics.

How the economy is thriving

Economists are practically stumbling over themselves to revise their growth forecasts higher. Many banks are drastically rolling back or even reversing their expectations for a 2023 recession.

On Wednesday, S&P Global Market Intelligence raised its third-quarter GDP estimate by nearly two percentage points to an annualized rate of 4%, citing surprisingly strong retail sales data. It moved its annual estimate up slightly to a historically strong 2.3%.

An even sunnier outlook comes from the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which currently expects third-quarter GDP growth at a whopping annualized rate of 5.6%.

The economy is “growing much stronger than we anticipated,” Morgan Stanley economists recently told clients in a research report. The bank now expects GDP for the year to clock in at a 1.9% pace — nearly double its previous projection.

Inflation hangover

Sharply higher prices in 2021 and 2022 marked a painful economic moment for households around the world. In the United States, inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The euro zone hit 10.6%, while the UK topped 11%.

Inflation has dramatically improved. The United States hit 3.2% in July, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. (The euro zone hit 5.3% in August, while the UK is at 6.8%.)

That means prices overall are still about 18% higher today than they were in late 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Despite all of that, real personal consumption expenditures are still growing at a strong pace, said Carola Binder, associate professor of economics at Haverford College. “So it seems that ‘bad vibes’ are not leading to a lot of precautionary saving.”

Gas prices on the rise

Gas prices, which are notoriously volatile, tend to feel like a slap in the face because they are unavoidable — even if you don’t drive, you see the prices on display outside every gas station.

Throughout 2022, gas prices were especially hard to predict as the Russian invasion of Ukraine jolted global commodities markets.

Earlier this summer, US drivers were enjoying big savings on gas compared with 2022. But by late August — around the time the CNN poll was conducted — prices had climbed back up to their highest level in months, just shy of $4 a gallon on average.

Unaffordable housing

The economy feels extra crummy for people looking to buy a home.

Housing affordability is at its lowest point in decades, with mortgage rates climbing above 7% to their highest level in more than 20 years. When Biden took office, mortgage rates were at a record low of 2.65%.

The Fed is partly to blame. Eleven interest rate hikes over the past year and a half have helped push mortgage rates higher, faster.

The median US home price has risen to $416,100 from $258,000 in 2019.

But the affordability issue isn’t just because of higher financing costs. It’s also because of historically low inventory, thanks to a pandemic-era buying spree combined with a lingering shortage rooted in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.

The partisan gap

CNN’s latest poll shows that Republicans and Democrats are both souring on President Biden’s handling of the economy.

Only 2% of Republicans and 48% of Democrats said economic conditions had improved under Biden. Nearly a quarter of Democrats said Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions. Ninety-one percent of Republicans agreed.

“People are no longer telling us how they feel about the economy — really, they’re telling us how they feel about the president,” Wolfers said.

Either way, that poses a political problem for President Biden, whose re-election campaign has sought to highlight the economy’s strengths.

“You can’t jawbone people into feeling better,” said former White House senior adviser David Axelrod on CNN This Morning. “I think the president has to find a way to talk about the things that he’s done in a context other than kind of asking for a report card from the American people.”

But polling has consistently shown the economy to be a weak spot for Biden’s reelection hopes. Just 33% approve of his leadership on the issue, according to a May survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.

For much of his presidency, Biden has blamed high gasoline prices, painfully rising food costs and other cost-of-living expenses on the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. He said those two factors were beyond his control as inflation hit a 40-year high last summer and crushed the his approval ratings.

In a Chicago speech on Wednesday, Biden will begin a new effort to actively convince a worried public that the U.S. economy is not heading for recession but actually thriving because of his leadership. For him, there’s a happy confluence of the coming 2024 reelection campaign and a favorable turn in recent economic data, leading the White House to believe that public messaging about “Bidenomics” will help to rally Democratic voters going into next year.

The message is not a new one, though the White House believes it bears repeating so that it soaks in. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Monday’s news briefing that the president’s upcoming remarks would be a “cornerstone” speech and part of a larger administration-wide effort.

“It’s a vision about growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up — you hear us say that over and over again, because we believe that trickle-down economics does not work,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have the data to prove it.”

Indeed, the rate of inflation has fallen over the past year while the job market has remained solid, a combination that seemed unlikely to many economic analysts who expected efforts to bring down inflation would cause layoffs and a recession. Goldman Sachs has put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25%, down from its previous estimate of 35%.

Consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 4% in May, down from 9.1% last June. That’s still higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, indicating that inflation remains a challenge. But employers added a robust 339,000 jobs last month in a sign that the economy appears poised to keep growing. And the inflation-adjusted annual increase in what people earn each hour turned positive in May, one of the main indicators that White House officials had been looking at for proof the economy was helping workers.

Biden’s GOP rivals have said that the president has broken the U.S. economy. They’ve tip-toed around the healthy 3.7% unemployment rate and focused instead on prices at the gas pump, grocery bills, the debt tied to Biden’s $1.9 trillion in pandemic relief and the administration’s focus on shifting away from fossil fuels in order to combat climate change.

“I will stop Joe Biden’s inflation nightmare, save the U.S. economy,” said former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, in a speech to evangelical Christians last weekend.

“You would think that with these economic problems with inflation, you may want to tap into more domestic energy,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in an Iowa speech. “But no, Biden is deliberately trying to kneecap our energy production and he’s trying to force Americans into electric vehicles, which will make us more reliant on China, who provides most of the materials for the batteries.”

Part of Biden’s challenge is that confidence in his economic leadership has waned. In March 2021 just after his round of pandemic relief became law, 60% of U.S. adults approved of how the president was handling the economy, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll. Since then, that figure has essentially halved.

Still, there are signs that people’s views of the economy are improving. The University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment showed that Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters generally feel better about the current state of the economy than they did a year ago. But confidence among Democrats is still weaker than it was during Biden’s first year.

The administration released a memo ahead of Biden’s Wednesday speech that made the point that his policy ideas are broadly supported in polls, leaving unsaid that those proposals generally fare better than the president himself does.

Biden aides see ‘Bidenomics’ as an expansive framing to a host of the president’s policies for easy public consumption, tying together a diverse set of initiatives meant to boost the nation’s global competitiveness with programs meant to strengthen the middle class at home.

The president is betting that targeted government investments can catapult the economy forward and help workers. During his first two years when Democrats controlled the House, Biden followed up on his pandemic relief by pushing through a bipartisan infrastructure building bill, funding for computer chip plants and tax breaks to encourage the use of renewable energy.

This approach goes back to Biden’s own blue collar identity that surfaces in his speeches: the Scranton, Pennsylvania kid whose family at times just eked by financially.

But it can take several years to replace bridges and tunnels, to build new factories, to lay broadband cable for the internet and to make drivers comfortable with buying electric vehicles. Administration officials have privately acknowledged that there is a lag between the economy that the president is promising and what voters will likely see by the 2024 elections.

Biden in remarks in July 2021 had initially dismissed higher inflation as “transitory,” saying he was confident that the bout coming out of the pandemic was temporary. Those remarks became a point of attack among Republican lawmakers and some economists as inflation worsened after his statement.

Yet Biden has stressed that he provides an alternative to GOP policies that try to boost the economy mostly through tax cuts. He said Monday in announcing more than $40 billion to ensure high-speed internet for the entire country that his ideas are similar to the New Deal-era playbook used to combat the Great Depression nearly a century ago.

“What we are doing, as I said, is not unlike what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he brought electricity to nearly every American home and farm,” Biden said.

The question is whether voters think that Biden can deliver just as FDR did and whether elections work the same as they did back in 1936, when the Rural Electrification Act became law. Later that November, Roosevelt won more than 60% of the popular vote as he won a second term.

In today’s polarized era, Biden is unlikely to secure anywhere near that margin. But his message on Wednesday will likely be that his presidency has already begun to reshape the world’s largest economy for the better and voters should judge him on that record.

He previewed the takeaway he wants voters to hear at a fundraiser last week in California, even as polls indicate that much of the public still feels pessimistic about the direction of the U.S.

“We unleashed, I think,” he said, “a sense of expectation in America that we can do anything.”

Many forecasters predicted a recession at the year’s outset, some even asserting it with a 100% probability. This blog post highlights ten trends that capture some of the most important economic developments of the past year. Taken together, they depict an economy characterized by robust growth driven by strong consumer spending backed by robust and steady job growth, growing real wages, and historic gains for women and Black workers. At the same time, the data show that the historic public investments that make up the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda in critical sectors for future growth, resiliency, and security are beginning to come to fruition. Nevertheless, there is more work to do to lower costs for American families and ensure Americans feel the benefit of continued real wage growth, a strong labor market, and declining inflation.

Growth was stronger than expected a year ago.

Defying pessimistic forecasts, US economic growth has progressed at a significant pace over the course of 2023. Last December, the private consensus for real economic growth as measured by the Blue Chip Economic Forecast was negative 0.1% for the year. The latest Blue Chip projection for 2023 growth, incorporating all available data to date, is positive 2.6%, driven by strength in consumer spending, a revival in manufacturing structures investment and increased state and local government purchases. The level of US real GDP in 2023 even exceeded some pre-pandemic forecasts, including that of the Congressional Budget Office and the International Monetary Fund. Sound household balance sheets and a strong labor market are the primary drivers of US consumer expenditures, which continue to grow at a pace close to the average among prior expansions.

Manufacturing investment reached historic highs.

In 2023 Q3, real (inflation-adjusted) private manufacturing construction investment reached its highest level on record since 1958. Likewise, manufacturing construction contributed the most to year-on-year real GDP growth on record. A major factor in this historic manufacturing boom has been the Inflation Reduction Act.

Jobs growth cooled towards a steady & stable pace, while the unemployment rate stayed low despite falling inflation.

Job gains continued at a very strong pace in 2023, although down from the torrid rates seen in 2021 and 2022 immediately following the pandemic recession. Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by 232,000 per month on average in 2023, 55,000 more jobs per month than the average pace in 2018 and 2019. As a result, total job gains achieved under the Biden administration reached 14.1 million through November 2023. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has, to date, stayed below 4% for 22 straight months, a run not seen in more than 50 years. This is especially remarkable given the fall in inflation.

Inflation decelerated throughout the year

After peaking in summer 2022, inflation has been on a downward trend for a year and a half thanks to a retreat of food, energy, and goods inflation. Inflation in the services sector—which heavily depends on wages as labor is the most important cost in the production of services— has decelerated more slowly and in lockstep with a gradual moderation of wage inflation. Meanwhile, market data on new leases suggest that housing price pressures should continue to ease.

…in large part thanks to healing supply chains.

As CEA has highlighted, the rise and subsequent fall of inflation during the pandemic was overwhelmingly linked to supply-side forces, including the unsnarling of global supply chains and the rise in prime-age labor force participation. Our analysis finds that the unsnarling of supply chains, either by themselves or in tandem with cooling demand, explain 80 percent of the disinflation that has occurred thus far. In fact, one of the most important economic developments of the year was the achievement of significantly lower inflation without a substantial rise in the unemployment rate.

Real wages grew and wage inequality fell.

Real wages began to grow in 2023 as inflation fell from its 2022 peak and workers received robust nominal wage gains. In the year ending in November, real wages grew by about 0.8 percent for all workers and 1.1 percent for the 80% of workers who are production and non-supervisory workers. Further, wage inequality fell. The ratio of wages at the 90th percentile compared to the 10th percentile fell by nearly 6 percent over the year. One reason to continue to be optimistic about this trend in 2024 is the historic union activity and wins in 2023. Strong unions help grow the economy by reducing inequality and raising incomes.

Women and Black Americans made historic gains in the labor market.

The year 2023 saw the highest rate of prime-age women participating in the labor force on record since 1948. The previous high of 77.3 percent in April 2000 has been surpassed in each of the last eight months. The record labor force participation of this group has served to boost incomes of American households and keep consumer spending strong.

In 2023, the economy achieved the smallest gap on record between the employment rates for Black versus white American workers, averaging–0.7 percentage point. The strong economy fostered by President Biden’s economic policies reduced some long-running inequities in the labor market and squeezed this gap to its lowest level on record.

Consumer sentiment improved in 2023.

With more work to do on lowering costs, consumer sentiment has further room to grow. However, 2023 saw momentum in the recovery of consumer attitudes. One way to see this is by tracking the same workers over time in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment. Figure 10 shows the difference between the share of respondents who report higher sentiment than they did six months prior and those who report lower sentiment over the same period. Values greater than zero indicate that more respondents are reporting improved sentiment over the period versus a decline in sentiment. Throughout 2023, the net share of respondents reporting higher sentiment than they had 6 months prior reached between 10-20 percentage points, a level of momentum historically associated with robust economic growth."

Rising prices are largely to blame. New data coming out Tuesday is expected to show that inflation once again lessened its grip on households in October, extending a year-long trend. That comes on top of a string of eye-popping data points — strong economic growth, unemployment at longtime lows, wages finally outpacing inflation, all leaving Americans with more money in their bank accounts than they have had in years.

President Biden has played a considerable role in improving Americans’ financial situation, through legislative victories that have yielded a surge in government funding and related private investment, which is building electric vehicles, new bridges, airport upgrades and a host of other infrastructure and green energy projects that have juiced the economy.

Yet Americans are still angry that prices rose as much as they did, showing up in consumer sentiment that has fallen for three straight months. Just 30 percent of voters approve of President Biden’s handling of the economy, the lowest reading since he took office, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

That disconnect between a booming economy and how Americans feel about it appears to be widening at a critical time ahead of next year’s presidential election. It is also shaping up to be a key liability for the White House, even as its policies are bolstering job creation and business investments.

For many voters, the economy’s recent growth comes alongside other realities, such as high inflation, rising interest rates that have made loans more costly and dwindling savings. Importantly, home prices are at an all-time high, and housing affordability is near a record low, which is also influencing people’s feelings about their finances.

“Those are all very salient things: how much you’re spending at the grocery store, how much you’re paying in rent, whether you can afford to move,” said Jonathan Rothwell, principal economist at polling giant Gallup. “Those factors are very important to people’s sense of how the economy is doing, and they’re not performing well.”

Inflation, at 3.7 percent, has come down dramatically from last summer’s high of 9.1 percent and is expected to decline even further in this week’s reading. But it’s still well above what policymakers would like and has become a sticking point for households across the country. Basic expenses, such as food, housing and transportation, are considerably higher than they were a year ago, even as energy prices have declined.

At the same time, families are quickly spending down the trillions in extra cash they had amassed during the pandemic. There is a growing sense among Americans, economists say, that they’re having to overspend to maintain their pre-pandemic standard of living, which is clouding their view of the broader economy.

That’s creating ongoing challenges for the president. The White House has been playing up its “Bidenomics” plan — which has spurred more than $1 trillion in public and private investments in infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductors — with creating new jobs and helping workers secure higher wages. That money is already making its way through the economy and boosting growth.

But the bigger struggle, political analysts say, has been making it clear to Americans that the local improvements they’re seeing, in roads, high-speed internet connections and airports, are being powered by Biden’s policies. Many federal funds are being doled out through state and local governments, and are often going to businesses and contractors instead of directly to families.

“‘Bidenomics’ is the right plan. It’s the right approach, and we need to just work every day to show Americans how it is delivering for them around the kitchen table,” Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview. “That’s our focus: trying to make that connection that clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, lower drug prices, better jobs — these are all things the president is delivering every day.”

So far, the message appears to be falling flat. A recent New York Times/Siena poll shows that a vast majority of voters in battleground states — 81 percent — say the economy is “fair” or “poor.” Meanwhile, 59 percent of voters in those states said they trusted Trump’s handling of the economy over Biden’s.

Those low marks come even as the U.S. economy has, by many measures, notched quarter after quarter of strong growth. Employers have added 14 million jobs under Biden’s watch, and household wealth surged during the pandemic. The median net worth of U.S. families grew by an unprecedented 37 percent between 2019 and 2022, to $192,900, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.

But there are also signs the biggest income gains went to the wealthiest Americans, according to the Fed’s survey, while average incomes inched down for those at the bottom.

“A lot of the gains that have been reported in the economy have been oriented toward wealthier people,” said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and an economic adviser to President Donald Trump. “People are feeling financially stressed because over the last two years, inflation has gone up and they’re falling behind.”

Recent union victories could help push wages even higher. In the last four months, hundreds of thousands of workers — including delivery truck drivers, health-care workers, Hollywood writers and, most recently, autoworkers and actors — have secured historic union contracts with higher pay and more job security.

The president made history this fall when he joined autoworkers on the picket line and played a supporting role in getting the deal done, making phone calls to automakers and urging them to stick to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, top Labor Department officials have been involved in recent union negotiations, including at Kaiser Permanente, where 85,000 health-care workers last week ratified a four-year contract that bumps the minimum wage to at least $23 and gives existing workers a 21 percent raise.

“This is a moment for workers, in which workers are winning at the bargaining table, they’re winning in the workplace,” said Julie Su, the Labor Department’s acting secretary. “All of those things did not happen by accident. They happened because this president has been very clear that when we build an economy that does right by workers, that’s good for employers and that’s good for the nation.”

Whether that will translate to higher approval ratings or votes, though, is unclear. White House officials say the strong economy and tight labor market made these contract negotiations possible in the first place, by giving workers the leverage to demand better working conditions. At the same time, union workers in some states have moved away from the Democratic Party in recent elections.

“The big problem for Democrats right now is that Trump did very well with Blue Collar America, no question about it, and a lot of those blue-collar workers are union workers,” Moore of the Heritage Foundation said. “It’s quite possible that by winning these big union concessions, that some of them will migrate back to the Democrats. But if I were a Democrat, I’d be very nervous about the abandonment of the rank-and-file union members.”

The Biden administration though, has a year to turn around its approval ratings and convince Americans that it’s doing enough to improve their financial standing. White House officials say they feel optimistic that Americans will begin to feel better about the economy, particularly as energy costs continue to recede. Average gas prices nationwide have fallen roughly 11 percent in the last year, from $3.80 a gallon to $3.40 a gallon, according to AAA.

The administration is also working to drive down health-care costs by capping prescription drug prices for seniors on insulin, for example, which “will help Americans feel more confident,” according to a senior White House official.

“We are still recovering from the pandemic and its devastating effects on the economy,” said Su. “Workers are, like everybody else, reassessing their role in the economy. They’ve had four decades of increased productivity but stagnating wages. It’s going to take some time for us to build an economy in which those concerns are addressed.”

By any measure, Robert Huber and his fiancée are doing well: They make six figures apiece, have gotten consistent raises and are preparing to close on a custom-built house in Midlothian, Va.

Still, he said they feel the continued squeeze of inflation.

“With food and utilities going up, it doesn’t matter what your budget level is — we’re all feeling the pinch,” said Huber, 46, who works in health-care sales. “We’re doing well, but we’ve certainly cut back on things. When you go to the grocery store and steaks are $14 a pound, when they used to be $7 a pound, it’s like, ‘Eh, maybe I’ll get something else for dinner today.’ It forces you to rethink your budget.”

Huber, a registered Independent who voted for Biden in 2020, said he plans to do so again. He doesn’t blame the president for rising prices — after all, he said, many other parts of the world have it much worse. But he said the administration could be doing more to connect with Americans.

“Where I think he’s messing up is with the messaging,” he said. “I know GDP’s up and the job market has been favorable, but that’s not what people care about. They want to know: How are you going to lower the price of my breakfast cereal?”"

In a major economic speech in Chicago, Biden said his administration’s efforts were sparking recovery after Republican policies had crushed America’s middle class. But the poll said only one in three U.S. adults approve of his economic leadership.

That 34% figure is even lower than his overall approval rating of 41%, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Biden’s approval figures have barely moved for the past year and a half, a source of concern for a president pursuing a second term on his ability to govern and focus on workers. He wants voters to connect local roads and bridge projects, factory construction and the rise of electric vehicles and renewable energy to the millions of dollars in initiatives he signed into law during the first two years of his administration.

“Bidenomics is about the future,” he declared in his Wednesday speech to cheering supporters. “Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American dream.”

At the same time, he sought to paint previous Republican tax cuts as deeply flawed, saying they helped the rich but failed the middle class for decades as the promised “trickle down” benefits never seemed to come to the less wealthy.

“The trickle down approach failed the middle class,” he said. “It failed America. It blew up the deficit. It increased inequity. And it weakened our infrastructure. It stripped the dignity, pride and hope out of communities, one after another.”

As he was departing Washington on Wednesday, Biden said he believes the U.S. will avoid the recession that many economic analysts have been expecting. Republican leaders such as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said last year that the high inflation under Biden’s watch meant that “we are in a recession,” but that is not the case under economic definitions.

GOP officials say their tax cuts have encouraged business investments and profits that have improved pay for workers and bolstered the stock market, while greater government spending would cause prices to keep rising and waste money.

Indeed, the economy has steadily improved over the past year of Biden’s term in the White House.

The Conference Board said Tuesday that consumer confidence this month reached the highest level since January 2022. Unemployment stands near a historic low at 3.7%. The inflation that has plagued Biden’s presidency has fallen to 4% from a peak of 9.1% last June. But prices are still rising significantly faster than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, a worry for voters and a line of attack for Republican lawmakers and other presidential candidates.

And smoke from Canadian wildfires, evident in Chicago on Wednesday, has added a new cloud for workers and shoppers in the U.S. The White House said it’s monitoring the air quality in Chicago but would not cancel the president’s scheduled events, which included a campaign reception in addition to the speech on the economy.

The new poll identifies a weakness within Biden’s own base. Many of the Democrats he needs to marshal in 2024 are comparatively unenthusiastic about his economic record. Seventy-two percent within his party say they approve of his handling of his job overall, but just 60% say they approve of his handling of the economy.

By comparison, during the depths of the pandemic as unemployment spiked, Republicans approved by overwhelming numbers of then-President Donald Trump’s economic leadership. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans now approve of Biden overall or on the economy, a testament to the polarization that defines modern U.S. politics.

Sarah Husted, 40, said she voted in 2020 for Biden, but “I wasn’t thrilled with either candidate.”

Living in Lincoln, Nebraska, Husted said that she feels as though inflation is getting worse, especially with regard to utilities and housing. But she largely believes the economic turmoil still reflects the disruptions caused by the pandemic.

“I don’t think that President Biden is helping the situation as much as he could, but I don’t think it’s all his fault,” she said.

That take was shared by other poll respondents interviewed by AP who voted for Biden in 2020. They generally saw him as a president grappling with partisan divisions, global competition and the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.

“He’s doing the best he can, but he can’t do anything without Congress,” said Alice Banner, 86, a retired nurse from Baltimore County, Maryland.

Ben Will, 34, noted the solid job growth during Biden’s presidency and said the infrastructure spending that Biden signed into law would help with growth.

“He’s doing a fantastic job with the cards that were dealt to him,” said Will, a marketing and advertising director from Reading, Pennsylvania.

Overall, 30% of U.S. adults say they think the national economy is good, up slightly from the 25% who said that last month, when the president and congressional Republicans were in the midst of negotiations over raising the nation’s debt limit and a historic government default was a risk. No more than about a third have called the economy good since 2021.

The administration is making a data-driven argument in addition to Biden’s speech. The Treasury Department released an analysis showing that spending on factory-related construction has doubled since 2021 after adjusting for inflation. White House economists issued a report that shows inflation is lower in the U.S. than the rest of industrialized nations in the Group of Seven.

White House aides believe that Biden’s speech on Wednesday can generate greater awareness of his policies and increase Democratic voters’ appreciation of the economy. While the president’s allies acknowledge that many Americans still hold dim views of the economy, they note that the actual economic data was far worse last November, when Democrats mounted a stronger-than-expected showing in the midterm elections.

Biden aides say they are encouraged by data showing Americans’ views can be changed by a consistent message reinforced on multiple fronts, which is what the president and his Cabinet are setting out to do by touring the U.S. over the next three weeks. Their hope is that repetition of Biden’s accomplishments, coupled with a contrast to GOP proposals to undo those initiatives, will stick with voters for 2024.

Only 36% of U.S. adults approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, slightly lower than the 42% who approve of his overall performance, according to the new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Both figures are close to where Biden’s approval numbers have stood for about the past year and a half, including just two months ago. Signs of an improving economic outlook have done little to sway how people feel about the Democratic president as he gears up for a 2024 reelection campaign that could pit him against his predecessor and 2020 opponent, Republican Donald Trump.

Job growth has stayed solid with the unemployment rate at 3.5%, while the pace of inflation has slowed sharply over the past year to the annual rate of 3.2%.

Both Biden and Trump have weaknesses as older candidates seeking a rematch. Trump, 77, faces a series of criminal indictments that include his possession of classified material and allegations that he tried to overturn the 2020 election, which has rallied support among Republicans while leaving him with substantial vulnerabilities in a potential general election contest.

Biden, 80, has yet to fully bring Democrats to his side as the lingering aftershocks of inflation still weigh on people’s minds. Along with members of his cabinet and Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden has been speaking about the $500 billion worth of new investments by private companies that he said came from incentives he signed into law.

Erica Basile, a teacher who describes herself as a “staunch Democrat,” said she feels the economy is “mediocre, but improving.”

“I do think in many ways they’re working very hard at getting the economy back on track post-COVID,” said Basile, who lives in Lynnwood, Washington.

Just 65% of Democrats approve of Biden’s economic leadership, while 76% approve of how he’s handling the job overall.

In follow-up interviews, some survey respondents felt torn between the desire to return to a sense of normalcy after Trump’s presidency and the desire for even more sweeping policies to address climate change, health care costs and taxes.

“When Joe Biden was selected to be the nominee and eventually won, my feeling at the time was that he could be the most milquetoast and undramatic president to help the country cool down,” said Steven Peters, 41, who works in information technology in White House, Tennessee. “Unfortunately, that’s what he’s been. I’m dissatisfied because I had hoped there would be more change.”

Peters added, “He’s really middle of the road when a lot of people would like to see more dramatic action.”

For GOP supporters, such as Merritt Rahn, 74, Biden has gone too far. Rahn said he is retired but also works at Home Depot and sees higher gasoline and food costs as making it harder for families to get by financially. The Jensen Beach, Florida, resident said Biden will further hurt the U.S. by moving energy sources away from oil and gas.

“It’s a death to our society and economy,” said Rahn, who added that he believes Biden “has no clue what’s going on.”

The poll also found that 55% of Democrats say they don’t think Biden should run again in 2024, though a large majority — 82% — say they would definitely or probably support him if he is the nominee. Overall, only 24% of Americans say they want Biden to run again.

Among Democrats who approve of how Biden is handling the economy, 58% would like him to seek another term. Just 20% of those who disapprove of his performance on the issue want the incumbent president to run again.

Biden continues to struggle to appeal to younger Democrats, especially on the economy. Only 52% of Democrats under age 45 say they approve of his handling of the economy, compared with 77% of those older.

The president has used the term “Bidenomics” to try to encompass his ideas to lower costs for people on Medicare, shift toward electric vehicles and renewable energy, and build factories for advanced computer chips and batteries. Yet some are still struggling to understand what the term means.

Asked about the definition of Bidenomics, Cory O’Brien, 39, said: “You know what, dude, I have no idea. Biden is a free market capitalist like most moderate Democrats are.”

The age gap extends to Biden’s reelection campaign: Just 34% of Democrats under 45 want him to run again, compared with 54% of those older than that. Still, about three-quarters of younger Democrats say they’ll most likely support him if he’s the nominee, though only 28% say they definitely will.

O’Brien, who works in education and lives in Massachusetts, said he expects the 2024 election to be “miserable” for voters because of the likely Biden and Trump rematch.

“I think it’s going to be a miserable election cycle,” he said. “We’re going to see a lot of the same stuff that we saw in 2020.”

Biden also faces renewed pressure related to investigations over his son Hunter’s business dealings. The poll finds that a majority of Americans — 58% — have hardly any confidence in Biden to reduce corruption in government, though that’s unchanged since January. Another 30% have some confidence and 10% have have a great deal of confidence.

The poll shows that 23% of Americans say they have a great deal of confidence in Biden’s ability to effectively manage the White House, 31% have some confidence and 45% have hardly any. Despite the fact that Biden has achieved several of his major policy goals, just 16% say they have high confidence in his ability to do that, while 38% say they have some confidence and 44% hardly any.

Few Americans say they think the national economy is doing well: 34% describe it as very or somewhat good. No more than about a third of Americans have called the economy good since 2021.

319,Biden's State of the Union to tout policy wins on economy - The Associated Press,Biden's State of the Union to tout policy wins on economy  The Associated Press,"Sun, 05 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JpZGVuLXBvbGl0aWNzLXVuaXRlZC1zdGF0ZXMtZ292ZXJubWVudC1jaGluYS1idXNpbmVzcy1hZjViZGQ2OTc3ZGY4ZGI2MDdlNmE4NmViM2Q4MzIyNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will use his second State of the Union address on Tuesday to remind Americans of how their lives have been improved over his first two years in office, as he tries to confront pessimism in the country and navigate the tricky politics of a newly divided Washington.

Rather than laying out major new policy proposals, Biden was expected to devote much of his speech to highlighting his efforts over the past two years to create jobs, fight inflation and improve the nation’s infrastructure. The speech comes as Biden is honing his pitch to voters ahead of his expected announcement in the next few months that he will seek another term in office despite voter frustrations about the direction of the nation.

“Next week, I’ll be reporting on the state of the Union,” Biden said Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report that saw the unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than 53 years. “But today, I’m happy to report that the state of the Union and the state of our economy is strong.”

Biden’s remarks from the House rostrum will take place in a sharply different context from a year ago. Republicans now control the chamber, rendering it unlikely that any significant legislation reaches Biden’s desk. The newly empowered GOP is itching to undo many of Biden’s achievements and raising the specter of persistent investigations — including into the recent discoveries of classified documents from his time as vice president at his home and former office.

“Jobs are up, wages are up, inflation is down, and COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden told the Democratic National Committee on Friday. “But now, the extreme MAGA Republicans in the House of Representatives have made it clear they intend to put it all at risk. They intend to destroy it.”

The president, meanwhile, is shifting his focus from legislating to implementing the massive infrastructure and climate bills passed in the last Congress — and to trying to make sure Americans credit him for the improvements.

“These things don’t sell themselves,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday on NBC. “And it’s one of the reasons I’m really looking forward to that State of the Union address. I will say that there have been so many accomplishments under this administration. It can be difficult to list them in a distilled way.”

While large-scale bipartisanship remains unlikely, Biden was set to reissue his 2022 appeal for Congress to get behind his “unity agenda” of actions to address the opioid epidemic, mental health, veterans’ health and cancer.

Biden will also call on lawmakers to responsibly raise the debt limit and keep the government funded. The president has remained opposed to negotiating to avoid default, while Republicans are pushing for unspecified deep spending cuts to reduce the deficit.

Biden, according to two administration officials who requested anonymity to preview the speech, was also expected to discuss his decision to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon Saturday, as part of a broader section on countering China’s more assertive economic and military actions around the world.

His address last year came just days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and many in the West doubted Kyiv’s ability to avoid a swift routing. Now the war is on the cusp of entering its second year, and under Biden the U.S. and allies have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defenses. Now the president must make the case — both at home and abroad — for sustaining that coalition as the war drags on.

Meanwhile, inflation, which rose precipitously last year in part because of soaring energy prices from the war, has begun to ease.

Still, only a quarter of U.S. adults say things in the country are headed in the right direction, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research; about three-quarters say things are on the wrong track.

Similarly, views of the national economy remain deeply negative, with 24% calling the national economy good and 76% calling it poor. Forty-one percent of Democrats and 8% of Republicans call the economy good. The figures are similar to when Biden delivered his State of the Union address last year, but an adjustment from Biden’s first year in office when Americans were more optimistic; about half said they thought the country was headed in the right direction when the president took office.

At the same time, 57% say their personal financial situation is good. That’s unchanged since December but has eroded slightly since earlier last year. No less than 62% of Americans had called their personal financial situation good in AP-NORC polls conducted from late 2019 through spring of 2022.

Two years after Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters, a protective fence was reinstalled Sunday around the Capitol ahead of Biden’s address.

After the speech, Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and his Cabinet plan to hold over 30 events in two days to drive the message home to the American people in their communities. Biden will visit Wisconsin to discuss job creation on Wednesday and on Thursday will be in Tampa, Florida to talk about his efforts to lower prescription drug costs and protect Social Security and Medicare.

“During the State of the Union, President Biden will outline how the past two years has seen historic job growth, falling inflation, higher wages, and record investments coming back to America,” the White House said. “The economic travel blitz showcases how the president’s vision is creating jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure, lowering costs for families, tackling climate change, investing in our future and delivering for families too often left behind.”

The travel follows Biden’s stops last week in Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia focused on rail and water infrastructure projects funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

The speech on Wednesday in Chicago, which is timed to coincide with a 2024 campaign fundraising trip, comes as the administration tries to deal with an apparent disconnect between public perceptions about the economy and actual economic conditions.

“What I would say is that the president’s economic policies are incredibly popular,” Olivia Dalton, the White House’s principal deputy press secretary, said Tuesday. “When you ask people what they think about investing in our roads, bridges and airports, when you ask people what they think about educating and empowering workers, when you ask people about how they feel about reshoring manufacturing jobs and investing in America, those things are incredibly popular.”

Biden has long argued in favor of economic policies designed to build from the “bottom up” and from the “middle out” rather than the “top down.”

“We decided to replace this theory with what the press has now called ‘Bidenomics.’ I don’t know what the hell that is,” the president said at a June 17 political rally with organized labor in Philadelphia. “But it’s working.”

Now, heading into reelection, the president and his supporters need to make the case that it is actually working, and embracing and explaining “Bidenomics” has been a goal the president and his administration set for this week.

In a Monday memo, Biden senior advisers Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon made the case that the president’s economic plan was working as designed.

“Better pay and other Biden Administration policies have helped put middle class Americans into stronger financial position than they were in pre-pandemic — despite the global challenge of Inflation,” they wrote. “Americans have higher net worths and higher real disposable incomes today than they did before the pandemic.”

Among the successes touted by Dunn and Donilon on the inflation front were efforts to bring down costs through increased competition on products and the approval of the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids.

“After ocean shipping costs increased as much as tenfold during the pandemic — driving up prices for a variety of consumer goods — the President worked with Congress to enact an overhaul of ocean shipping laws to encourage competition and protect both American importers and exporters,” Dunn and Donilon wrote.

Speech has risks

The strategy is not without risk, since Wednesday’s speech could provide fodder for an endless loop of Republican campaign ads if economic conditions falter going into the general election next year.

The president launched the latest “Invest in America” roadshow Monday with an event at the White House to announce $42 billion in high-speed broadband investments from bipartisan infrastructure law funds for communities across the country, and there are plenty of additional announcements to come.

Republicans contend that what the president’s team is trying to sell is not representative of what people are experiencing.

“The Biden administration is in a fantasy world, insisting their ‘policy has indeed worked.’ Americans don’t want Biden to ‘finish the job,’” Tommy Pigott, the Republican National Committee’s rapid response director, said Tuesday, citing polling including from a Harvard University/Harris survey showing a clear majority said their economic situation is not getting better.

Dalton and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard faced questions Tuesday about inflation and specific sectors of the economy that are not going as smoothly, including recent reports of layoffs at the Ford Motor Co.

‘Swift and decisive actions’

“Right now, the United States is in a better position on inflation than any other major economy, and why is that? It’s because the president took a number of swift and decisive actions to make sure that we got our economy on track, that we got ourselves open and chugging along again,” Dalton said.

“There have been these … repeated predictions, and yet what we’ve seen in the actual data has been a lot of resilience,” Brainard said in response to a question about the chances of avoiding a U.S. recession. “We’re continuing to see [a] strong labor market, low unemployment. We’ve actually seen that stretch of a strong labor market improve due to the very large increase we’ve seen in participation of working-age Americans. And so there are reasons to think that we are going to continue to see resilience against a backdrop of what we have referred to as more stable economic growth.”

One area of ongoing concern is in the commercial office real estate market, which has faced ongoing headwinds because of the transition of office-based workers to more remote and hybrid environments.

“Some of the other areas of commercial real estate have actually been doing quite well, like industrial, and even retail has been doing better. Multifamily has been doing very well,” said Brainard, formerly a vice chair of the Federal Reserve. “Of course, we’re very attentive to where those financial risks may lie, and so far, they seem to be being managed pretty well.”"

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su, Environmental Protection Agency Chief of Staff Dan Utech, and other key stakeholders participated in a “Good Jobs in the Clean Economy” event with labor, conservation and environmental justice leaders to discuss how their agencies are collaborating to create good quality jobs in infrastructure, clean energy, manufacturing and technology as part of the President’s Investing in America agenda.

During the event, Secretary Haaland and Acting Secretary Su signed a Signed MOU With DOL On GJI [pdf]

to promote cooperative efforts between the two agencies to build sustainable career pathways that meet industry needs for talent and worker needs for quality jobs. The partnerships will enable both departments to share resources and expertise to guide their actions to meet their shared goals to expand an equitable and diverse workforce while taking significant action to combat climate change.

“With funding from the President’s Investing in America agenda, we are putting historic resources into the American workforce throughout our nation that support conservation, legacy pollution clean up, outdoor recreation, and our collective effort to address the climate crisis,” said Secretary Deb Haaland. “I’m thrilled that our new Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Labor will support continued cooperative efforts that help us draw on the strength and creativity of every worker in America.”

“The benefits made possible by our partnership will show we don’t need to choose between good jobs and climate action when, in fact, we can achieve both,” said Acting Secretary Julie Su. “The Investing in America agenda gives us an historic opportunity to put workers first and act to address climate change and other environmental concerns. It also allows us to include workers and communities historically left behind.”

Through the “Bidenomics” strategy, the Biden-Harris administration is growing the American economy from the middle out and bottom up – from rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure, to driving over $500 billion in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United States, to creating good paying jobs and building a clean energy economy that will combat climate change and make our communities more resilient. The Administration is making a once-in-a-generation investment in America’s infrastructure and our clean energy future and taking the next steps to bring offshore wind energy to additional areas around the country.

Since Day 1 of the Biden-Harris administration, the Department of the Interior has been leading the way in creating good-paying jobs in the clean energy economy, including jobs conserving and restoring public lands and waters, reducing the risk of wildland fire, addressing toxic legacy pollution sites, improving access to recreation and constructing new onshore and offshore clean energy projects.

The Department today released a new fact sheet highlighting workforce development and job creation efforts underway. Clean Energy Fact Sheet [pdf]

WASHINGTON – The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services held a hearing yesterday titled “Inflation: A Preventable Crisis.” At the hearing, subcommittee members asked expert witnesses how the fiscal policies pursued by President Biden, including the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have overstimulated the economy, increased inflation on Americans, and provided slush funds for Democrats’ radical agendas.

Subcommittee Republican members warned that Americans are still facing higher costs due to historically high inflation and the risk of a recession, yet the Biden Administration has ignored the damage they have done to the economy in pursuit of even more damaging tax hikes and spending.

Key Takeaways:

Despite warnings from Republicans and even former President Obama’s own economic advisor Larry Summers that the American Rescue Plan would trigger inflation, the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats rushed through trillions of dollars in spending and fueled the highest inflation in more than half a century.

President Biden rushed through spending in the American Rescue Plan, ignoring both warnings of inflation and data that the economy was growing.

Dr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, testified during the hearing that, “the American Rescue Plan – 1.9 trillion dollars in stimulus – was enacted in March of 2021 at a time when the U.S. economy was growing at 6.5 percent. It was plain in the data, things like GDPNow at the Atlanta Fed showed that.” He continued, “It [the ARP] was just much too big, and destined to cause macroeconomic disruptions.”

The Biden Administration doubled down on reckless spending with the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.

In opening remarks, Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) noted that Democrats spent billions in the IRA, even though there were still funds leftover from prior relief bills. As a result, the price of groceries increased by more than 11 percent.

Inflation has driven the massive increases in the price of groceries and energy, causing extreme stress on hardworking Americans and American families.

Dr. Douglas Holtz Eakin testified, “We are hardly done with this episode. […] Food, energy, and shelter are still rising at 8.5 percent year over year. Go to the gasoline station, go to the grocery store, go home, and be reminded that your paycheck is nearly 10 percent less valuable than a year before.”

The Biden Administration has ignored, denied, and passed the blame for the damage it has done to the economy for far too long. It is time they are held accountable.

Dr. John Taylor, Professor of Economics at Stanford University, warned in his testimony, “We’re still living in a high inflation era unless monetary policy actions are taken.”

Member Highlights:

Chairwoman Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) asked the witnesses whether Democrats were aware or that the American Rescue Plan would increase inflation before passing the legislation.

Rep. McClain: “Was it predictable that the American Rescue Plan would drive inflation so significantly?”

Dr. Doug Holtz Eakin: “Yes. People said so at the time, notably Larry Summers, former Secretary of the Treasury – an outstanding economist. History has given us examples just like the American Rescue Plan. In 1951, the U.S. economy was growing at 10.5 percent – quite rapid growth. Federal spending was increased by about 50 percent – that’s roughly the American Rescue Plan – two trillion on a four trillion base. Inflation jumped by six percentage points that year.”

Chairwoman McClain (R-Mich.) also noted that the Biden Administration irresponsibly tried to spin inflation as a “high-class problem,” although inflation disproportionately affects middle-income and low-income Americans.

Dr. Doug Holtz Eakin: “If you look at the median income in the United States and say, 50 percent of it is going to food energy and shelter, that’s a three-thousand-dollar tax on food, energy, and shelter at the current inflation rates. That’s a real loss in purchasing power for other purposes, because you have to devote it to those core elements.”

Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) discussed steps Congress could take to limit inflationary spending.

Rep. Foxx: “Last Congress, I introduced the Spending Safeguard Act, which would tamp down mandatory spending increases by establishing program specific caps for new or reauthorized programs. How would legislation like this effect America’s inflation?”

Dr. Taylor: “I think it would be a step in the right direction.”

Witnesses told Rep. Foxx that it would likely take longer than anticipated for inflation to return to normal levels.

Rep. Foxx: “When do you anticipate inflation to return to pre-COVID levels, and what action should the Biden Administration, Congress, and the Federal Reserve be taking to meet that timeline?”

Dr. Doug Holtz Eakin: “…Chairman Powell addressed the National Association for Business Economics and said it would take three years to get back to the two percent target. In the interim, inflation has proved more stubborn than he had anticipated, and the terminal rate they’re going to have to get to is higher than they had anticipated, so I think it will probably take longer than anticipated.”

Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) laid out how Democrats ignored warnings from Congressional Republicans, economists, and experts that the American Rescue Plan would overstimulate the economy.

Rep. Fry: “Dr. Holtz-Eakin, you previously testified in February of 2021 that the American Rescue Plan injected too large of a stimulus into the American economy. Can you elaborate on that?”

Dr. Doug Holtz Eakin: “Certainly. The bill when proposed came at a time when the weekly and monthly data we received suggested that the economy is growing quite rapidly. A good summary of this is something produced by the Atlanta Fed known as GDPNow, which sort of gives you an estimate of what the current growth rate is in the quarter for GDP. It was at six and a half percent. This was not the same as March of 2020 when the economy was falling at a rate that ultimately contracted by nearly ten full percentage points in a single quarter. It was extraordinary.

“So we are in a completely different situation, we are growing quite rapidly, and we’re getting close to full employment, we’re getting close to potential GDP and there’s no reason to have a nearly two trillion-dollar stimulus. It’s way too big for whatever problem you might have imagined remained.”

Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) warned that rather than acknowledge the economic harms they have perpetuated, the Biden Administration is shifting the blame for inflation to the invasion of Ukraine, oil and gas producers, and everyday Americans who drive non-electric vehicles.

Rep. Langworthy: “Do you think that President Biden’s recommendation to Americans that one of the ways to reduce energy prices is for them to go out and buy an electric car. Do you think that that’s a legitimate solution for most Americans?”

Dr. Doug Holtz Eakin: “Again, the inflation phenomenon is prices across the economy – all goods and services rising at the same time. So, picking out individual items and focusing on them, which is something people do a lot, misses the larger point. We have prices going up everywhere.”

Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) pointed out that now is not the time for the Fed to take a wait-and-see approach to addressing inflation. Chairman Comer also noted that there are steps Congress can take to help the Fed ease inflation and the economy recover faster.

Chairman Comer: “What would you say the most important way to fight inflation would be? What’s the silver bullet there?”

Dr. Taylor: “I think the problem is the Federal Reserve. Globally, you have the European Central Bank, you have other central banks around the world which are tending to follow the Fed to some extent as they have in the past. That’s an important thing. So the focus should be the Fed. As I mentioned, this Congress used to have policies that would require more reporting. That’s why the Fed has reported a little bit more. But that could go further.

They blew up the deficit. It produced an anemic economic growth, if any growth at all. And it stripped the dignity and pride and hope out of a community, one after another,” he said.

Despite criticism from Republicans, Biden assured that the economy is in good shape, saying the U.S. has the lowest inflation rate of any major economy. He also criticized recent Republican spending bill proposals as well as broader “ trickle down ” economic policies.

“It’s about growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up instead of the top down,” he said. “Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well.”

Speaking at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Maryland, Biden made the case for his administration’s economic vision amid recession fears .

President Joe Biden delivered remarks Thursday on the economy as House Republicans launch an impeachment inquiry and a possible federal government shutdown.

Biden on Wednesday brushed off the House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry, saying the way he sees it, they launched the investigation against him because they want to shut down the federal government.

Biden, speaking at a Democratic fundraiser in Virginia, said that instead of being concerned about the probe, “I’m focused on the things the American people want me focused on.”

The president’s remarks were the first since Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced the launch of a Biden impeachment inquiry while the Republican House leader is also struggling to shore up votes to fund the government and prevent a federal shutdown.

“The best I can tell is they want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government,” Biden said.

He also made a reference to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a top ally of his chief rival heading into the 2024 election, Donald Trump. “The first day she was elected, the first thing she wanted to do was impeach Biden,” he said.

“Look, I’ve got a job,” Biden told his audience. “I’ve got to deal with the issues that affect the American people every single, solitary day.”

McCarthy’s sudden decision to direct an impeachment inquiry into Biden over the business dealings of his son, Hunter, and the family finances has won over even the most reluctant Republicans, with some GOP lawmakers pushing for swift action while others expect it to drag into the 2024 election year.

McCarthy opened and closed a private meeting Wednesday of House Republicans justifying his reasoning for the inquiry sought by former President Trump.

The moment is a politically pivotal one for the embattled McCarthy, whose job is being targeted by Trump’s right-flank allies. He has already signaled potential charges of abuse of power, corruption and obstruction for possible articles of impeachment.

“There’s a lot of accusations out there you just want the answers to,” McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol.

The White House mobilized to fight what it called the “unprecedented, unfounded claims” against the president regarding his son, Hunter, and family finances.

Hard-right Republicans still want McCarthy to slash federal spending below the levels he and Biden agreed to as part of a budget deal earlier this year. And that stand risks a federal shutdown if they don’t fund the government by Sept. 30, when current money runs out.

Democrats are expected to oppose those Republican efforts as well as fight Biden’s impeachment.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the first impeachment of Trump, said McCarthy’s failure to bring the inquiry before the full House for a vote was “an acknowledgement that he lacks the support in his conference to move forward.”

“He is beholden to the more extreme elements,” Schiff said as lawmakers returned to Washington late Tuesday. “It is yet another indication of the weakness in the speakership and the degree by which he is manipulated by Donald Trump.”

Yet moderate Republicans representing districts that Biden won in 2020 over Trump and who are most at risk in next year’s election generally were supportive of McCarthy’s decision to launch the impeachment probe.

“I would have voted for it,” Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., said about the impeachment inquiry.

Garcia said, “There’s smoke there so we have a requirement to go investigate that and see if there’s fire there.”

Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, another one of the Republicans from districts Biden won, said he wasn’t worried about any backlash back home.

“I think my constituents deserve some answers,” he said."
329,Analysis | Biden's Economy Is Great Everywhere Except in the Polls - The Washington Post,Analysis | Biden's Economy Is Great Everywhere Except in the Polls  The Washington Post,"Sun, 22 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMy8xMC8yMi9iaWRlbi1zLWVjb25vbXktaXMtZ3JlYXQtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1leGNlcHQtaW4tdGhlLXBvbGxzL2Q2YmFlNzIyLTcwZDYtMTFlZS05MzZkLTdhMTZlZTY2NzM1OV9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"As the US economy continues to improve, President Joe Biden continues to not get credit for it. Only 35% of voters in seven swing states trust Biden on the economy, according to a Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll, with 51% saying it was better under Donald Trump.

This is undoubtedly a frustrating situation for the president, his campaign and Democrats overall. But they can take solace, if that’s the word, from the fact that Biden is doing better than most of his peers around the world. The American public’s discontent may not be about Biden-specific issues such as his age, his party or his dog — it’s just part of a global trend of bitterness and anger toward almost all incumbents.

How’s that for optimistic?

Yes, Biden’s approval rating in another Morning Consult survey is a dismal 40%. But that’s better than Canada’s Justin Trudeau (33%), the UK’s Rishi Sunak (28%), France’s Emmanuel Macron (26%), Germany’s Olaf Scholz (25%) or Japan’s Fumio Kishida (22%). The only leader of a G-7 country with better numbers than Biden is Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, at 44%. Not coincidentally, Meloni took office only about a year ago — mostly after the major inflationary episode of 2021-2022 had begun to improve.

For everyone else, the good news is that the inflation situation is improving. The bad news is that the public is still upset about the inflation that already happened, and is in no mood to forgive and forget.

Consider that in Poland, a coalition of centrist and liberal parties just ousted the country’s long-serving right-populist governing party, while in New Zealand, the right just won a landslide, booting a progressive government that had won global plaudits for its handling of Covid. Just across the Tasman Sea, Australia has one of the most popular incumbent heads of government in the developed world: Anthony Albanese, who took office in spring 2022 after defeating unpopular conservative incumbents.

In other words, the trend is clear: Incumbents of all ideological flavors are losing everywhere and are almost universally unpopular. The only exceptions are newly elected governments that don’t have the stink of inflation on them.

On one level, this makes sense. Why should voters give Biden credit for whipping an episode of inflation that they believe he created in the first place?

On another level, it’s crazy. Fresh data released by the Federal Reserve last week confirms that Americans’ inflation-adjusted net worth surged between 2019 and 2022, and real incomes are up as well. There’s plenty of room to debate and even second-guess the stimulative policies enacted during Covid, but it’s just not the case that inflation has left people worse off than they were before. The labor market recovered rapidly and robustly from pandemic disruptions.

Of course, hectoring the public that they should be more appreciative of what they have is not a great campaign message.

Then again, Biden’s messaging is probably working better than most people realize — and his much-discussed age may be overblown as an issue. The evidence is that essentially everyone else living through the same set of circumstances is doing even worse.

Under the circumstances, probably the best thing that Biden has going for him is that Election Day is more than a year away. It’s at least conceivable that voters will eventually forgive and forget the inflation of the past.

It’s also conceivable — likely, even — that they won’t. The inflation rate will fall, but there will be no reversals of the big price increases of 2021-22.

In which case, Biden’s best shot at winning may be simply being fortunate in his opponent. Republicans aren’t planning to run a fresh-faced outsider onto whom the public can project its hopes and dreams. Donald Trump is a known and disliked quantity who is more plagued with scandals and legal problems than he was at any time during his presidency.

A yearlong campaign focused primarily on criticizing Trump sounds depressing and uninspiring — and it will be. But virtually no incumbents in any rich democracies have found a way to make themselves popular. This reality calls into question the premise that there is any magic messaging solution.

None of this, I concede, is especially comforting to Democrats. But it should be bracing. It’s not just Biden’s poll numbers that are bad — it’s those of incumbent governments across the Western world. Deep, broad and profound forces are pulling them toward defeat, and they are operating with very little margin for error.

The president’s campaign for reelection is bound to be an uphill fight. His campaign is going to need to muster real discipline to defend the administration’s record and avoid getting embroiled in extraneous new controversies. Despite a greatly improved economic situation, the political fundamentals don’t look good for the White House. As they say on Wall Street: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Montgomery Locks and Dam near Pittsburgh is in the midst of a $857 million upgrade to ensure water levels in the Upper Ohio River are high enough for large cargo ships to pass through.

On a grassy roadside nearby, a white sign announces who’s behind the work: “Project funded by President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.”

For Biden, taking credit for an improving economy — including the jobs and growth made possible by the trillion-dollar public works law — has become a political imperative, one that will help determine whether he is reelected to a second term next year. Even as Democrats relish a recent hot streak of positive economic data, they acknowledge it won’t benefit Biden politically unless voters begin to associate him with the improvements.

The White House office responsible for the infrastructure signage says there will be hundreds of thousands of signs claiming credit for projects made possible by the 2021 law, many of which are just now getting started. The same sign is posted near a road improvement project in Wisconsin and a border crossing in Arizona. Even where the work isn’t obvious, there are signs. At a large empty field in Montana, a sign announces a Superfund site is being cleaned up thanks to the law.

It’s all now collected under the banner of “Bidenomics,” the blanket term adopted by the White House to take ownership of an improving economy ahead of the 2024 election.

Despite the improvement, polls continue to show wide disapproval of how Biden has handled the economy, to the frustration of the White House and its Democratic allies. Even as inflation slows, wages rise, hiring continues apace and recession fears ease, many Americans are still pessimistic about the economy and blame the president.

“It’s understandable that Americans’ perception of the economy operates with somewhat of a lag to real economic data,” said Brian Deese, who until February served as director of Biden’s National Economic Council. “The recent uptick in consumer sentiment is promising and heartening. If we continue to see progress in that direction, I would expect it would start to flow through more clearly into approval numbers as well.”

Progress in changing Americans’ sour economic perceptions has so far been slow. About half of Americans think the economy is still in a downturn and getting worse, according to a CNN poll released Thursday. Only 37% approve of Biden’s handling of the economy – a figure that has held roughly steady since last fall.

Three-quarters of Americans describe economic conditions in the country as poor, according to the CNN poll – despite better than expected economic growth, and experts from the Federal Reserve to Goldman Sachs to Bank of America now saying a recession is no longer likely in the next year.

Voters have more concerns, though, than just their bank accounts. Biden’s age continues to worry voters, according to polls. Enthusiasm for a second Biden term remains low among Democrats. And the national mood has been dampened by years of political and economic turmoil.

“Post Covid, people are in a bad mood. They’re not very convinced and optimistic about anything because there’s a level of PTSD, certain level of depression,” a Democratic strategist said. “It’s not because of Joe Biden. It’s just because of the times.”

On Friday, government data showed the economy added 187,000 jobs in July, slightly lower than expected but still a sign of robust hiring. The report showed the unemployment rate ticking down to 3.5%, near a historic low.

The jobs report is the latest in a string of positive economic data. Last week, government figures showed the economy grew at a 2.4% rate in the April-through-June period, a faster pace than in the first three months of the year and well above economists’ expectations.

Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan rose 13% in July, the second straight month of improvement. And wages are now rising faster than prices.

White House aides acknowledge it will take time both for Americans to start feeling the effects of a stronger economy and to associate Biden with those improvements. But they see recent data as encouraging tailwinds.

“We’re finally getting the kind of clouds-clearing that we need for people to actually hear that message and see what we’re doing,” a senior administration official said. “I think communication in this day and age is always tough, it’s a fractured media environment. And that makes it even more necessary for us to keep repeating it.”

Speaking in Maine last week, Biden suggested Republicans were looking elsewhere for attack lines — including investigations of his family — now that economic conditions were improving.

“Republicans may have to find something else to criticize me for now that inflation is coming down. Maybe they’ll decide to impeach me because it’s coming down,” he said at a textile factory in Auburn, the signs behind him all labeled “Bidenomics: Made in America.”

What might serve as a laugh line for Democrats is rooted in some reality: Even significant economic improvements may not shift political winds in an increasingly partisan climate. CNN’s July polling found 70% of Democrats approved of Biden’s handling of the economy, compared to just 5% of Republicans. And while increased optimism was apparent among respondents who identified as Democrats, an overwhelming majority of Republicans were still pessimistic.

“There is a tough set of questions around, ‘Are there structural factors at play that will make it more challenging for POTUS to convince voters that the gains are under his stewardship?’” a former senior administration official said.

Biden’s advisers believe the attempt to brand the president’s economic accomplishments has been working — slowly, they acknowledge — to shift perceptions of his record, citing the uptick in consumer sentiment. Yet Biden’s economic approval remains anemic, meaning the effort that began earlier this summer with podium speeches at shipyards, factories and plants around the country will continue into the fall.

Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and several other top administration officials launched another travel blitz this week – that will include stops by the president next week in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah – highlighting key legislative accomplishments and touting positive economic data across the country.

So far, the administration has leaned on its own Cabinet to deliver its message. But Biden should take a page from the playbook of President Barack Obama, another former official said, and leverage private-sector executives to talk up the economy.

“The Biden surrogate playbook doesn’t exist,” the former official said, suggesting leaders from manufacturing, clean energy and semiconductor industries could be effective cheerleaders for Biden’s policies and the investments they’ve spurred.

Obama faced similarly negative economic perceptions at a similar point in his first term, but the economy was in much worse shape. Only 26% of Americans approved of his handling of the economy in August 2011, a month in which unemployment stood at 9.1% and the US economy created zero jobs.

He went on to handily win reelection the following year.

“Obama had to change people’s minds about where he started from and the bad hand that he was dealt and what he did to improve the economy, and Biden has that story on steroids,” the Democratic strategist said. “He has a story about turning the economy around no president has.”

White House aides and advisers acknowledge there’s still time for that story to change, for momentum to slow, or for new risks to appear.

“The bottom line is, we don’t have a history of looking at economic cycles that follow global pandemics, that follow major shocks to our supply chains and our energy markets because of geopolitical forces,” another current senior administration official said. “There’s a lot that’s unusual about this economic cycle.”

With 15 months until Election Day, the Biden administration remains most focused on sustaining the momentum – and the message.

“I think they’re pretty comfortable playing the long-ish game on this,” the first former senior administration official said. “They are asking themselves the question, ‘Where are we going to be a year from now?’”"

Americans’ views of President Joe Biden’s job performance have ebbed since the start of the year, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds. The public’s views of the national economy remain lackluster, with more than 4 in 10 saying they’re seriously concerned rising costs could push them out of their own communities.

Roughly 4 in 10 Americans say the economy or the cost of living is the most important issue facing the country, far above the share who name any other issue, and few express optimism about where the economy is headed.

Fewer agree with the Democratic Party than with the GOP on how to handle the economy, crime, America’s role in the world or immigration, but Democrats do hold an advantage on a distinctly different set of issues. Americans align more with them than Republicans on abortion, climate change and voting-related issues, according to the survey, issues which seemed to be motivating factors for much of the Democratic base in last year’s midterm elections. And the public is closely split between the Democratic and Republican approaches to helping the middle class.

Neither party has majority support for its approach to any of the topics tested in the poll, with a significant minority of the public saying their views don’t match up with either party’s positions.

Biden, who began the year with a 45% job approval rating, has since seen his numbers erode further. In polls between March and early November, about 4 in 10 approved. In the latest survey, his job approval rating stands at 37%, with 63% disapproving, a downtick that leaves him facing his worst numbers since taking office by 1 percentage point. That remains a few points higher than former President Donald Trump’s approval low point of 34%, reached in 2021 shortly after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Trump is currently the front-runner for next year’s Republican nomination to challenge Biden.

Biden’s job approval stands at 72% among Democrats and 63% among self-described liberals, down from ratings in the 80s among those groups in January of this year. Fewer than half in most demographic groups now approve of his job performance, including college graduates (48%), Black Americans (47%), Latino Americans (42%), those 45 or older (41%), those younger than 45 (33%), White Americans (33%) and those without college degrees (31%).

A 71% majority of Americans rate economic conditions in the country as poor, with 38% calling them very poor. That marks an improvement from the summer of 2022, when 82% saw the economy as poor, but remains far worse than Americans’ pre-pandemic assessments of the economy. Views of the future are only slightly more optimistic than views of the present, with 61% expecting the economy to remain poor a year from now.

By a 10-point margin, Americans say their views on the economy align more closely with the Republican Party than with the Democratic Party; they also side with the GOP over the Democrats on crime and policing (by a 14-point margin), immigration (by 14 points) and America’s role in world affairs (by 6 points). But the public sides with the Democrats by similar margins on a slate of other issues: abortion (by 16 points), climate change (by 13 points), voting rights and election integrity (by 8 points) and education (by 5 points). Americans are more closely split on which party’s vision for helping the middle class is closer to their own (35% feel closer to Democrats, 32% to Republicans). Those divides follow a similar pattern as seen in polling last spring, in the run-up to the 2022 midterms.

Political independents side with the GOP on crime and policing (by a 13-point margin), immigration (10 points), and the economy (9 points). They align with Democrats on abortion (24 points), climate change (20 points), voting rights and election integrity (19 points), helping the middle class (13 points) and education (11 points).

About one-third of Democrats don’t think their party aligns with them on immigration, world affairs and crime; roughly similar shares of Republicans disagree with the GOP when it comes to abortion and climate change.

Asked to name the most important issue currently facing the country, 42% name economic or financial issues, a slight downtick from 48% at the start of the year, but still far ahead of any other issue. Another 12% in the most recent poll mention immigration or border security, with 10% naming foreign policy issues – an unusually high level of concern for that topic, which may be due in part to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Other topics of concern include partisanship and extremism (6%), guns and public safety (6%), and elections and threats to democracy (4%).

These concerns aren’t equally distributed across party lines. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, for instance, are 17 points likelier than Democrats and Democratic leaners to mention immigration or the border as the most important issue facing the nation, and 11 points likelier to cite economic-related issues. By contrast, Democratic-aligned adults are 8 points likelier than Republican-aligned adults to name issues related to elections and democracy, and 4 points likelier to mention environmental or energy issues.

There’s little variation among all Americans, though, in how the public views Biden’s handling of some of these top issues. Just 33% currently approve of his handling of the economy, 35% of his approach to helping the middle class and 36% of his handling of crime. The president fares slightly better on environmental policy, with 43% approving.

Economic concerns hit home for many Americans

Americans’ concerns for the country as a whole aren’t necessarily the same issues that worry them within their own communities. But both nationally and locally, economic concerns loom large.

An 84% majority say they’re at least somewhat worried about the state of the economy in their community, with 43% saying they are very worried – a rise from two years ago, when only 3 in 10 were very worried. And 74% today say they’re at least somewhat worried that the cost of living will climb so high that they will be unable to remain in their community, with 43% very worried about this possibility.

A 54% majority of those in households making less than $50,000 annually say they’re very worried about being pushed out by rising costs, as do 51% of those younger than 35, 48% of people of color and 48% of those who describe themselves as living in an urban area.

A divide on approaches to crime

A 72% majority of Americans say they’re at least somewhat worried about the risk of crime in their community, including 33% who say they’re very worried, a rise from two years ago. Sixty-five percent say they’re at least somewhat worried about violent crime, and 64% that they’re at least somewhat worried about theft and property crime in their community.

Roughly two-thirds of the public gives credence to a range of proposals to reduce crime in their community. A 71% majority says increasing police patrols would be at least somewhat likely to reduce crime while 69% say the same for increasing police funding. Similar shares endorse the potential effectiveness of enacting stricter sentencing laws for property crime (68%), increasing the number of cases in which prosecutors pursue charges (67%), increasing funding for local social services and anti-poverty programs (67%) and expanding community intervention programs (65%).

But this seeming uniformity masks some significant demographic and political divides. A 78% majority of Democrats see funding for social services as potentially helpful, more than say the same about any other proposal. By contrast, it’s the policy seen by the fewest Republicans as likely to reduce crime, with just 52% believing it would be likely to help.

Republicans, White Americans and those 45 and older are all significantly likelier than Democrats, Black Americans and those younger than 45 to say that increased policing, prosecutions and harsher sentencing are likely to reduce crime in their communities.

Most Americans express at least some confidence in their local police (68%), other people in their community (66%) and their local government (58%) to reduce crime where they live, with fewer saying the same of their state government (47%) or the US government (36%). While 77% of Americans age 45 and older, and 74% of White Americans express confidence in their local police, just 58% of those younger than 45 and 45% of Black Americans say the same.

Americans who are the most concerned about the risk of crime where they live also express the most distrust of their own community – 52% of those who are very concerned about the risk of crime say they have little or no faith in the people living near them to reduce crime levels, compared with 29% of those with less heightened concerns. Those who are very concerned about crime are also significantly likelier than others to say that more police patrols, stricter sentencing laws for property crimes and pursuing charges in more cases are very likely to reduce crime.

A 57% majority of registered voters say that the outcome of next year’s presidential election could have a big effect on the amount of crime and violence in the country, while 42% say that crime levels won’t be affected by who wins. In the fall of 2020, just 31% of registered voters thought that the upcoming presidential election would have no effect on crime.

A 73% majority of Republican voters currently say that the 2024 election could have a major effect on crime and violence, with half of Democratic and independent voters saying the same.

The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 1-30 among a random national sample of 1,795 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Unfortunately today, people continue to struggle more than they did when the president first took office:

Inflation is up more than 15 percent.

The cost of groceries for Americans has risen approximately 20 percent .

His policies have led innovators to stop research into potentially new treatments, including for brain cancer and leukemia.

for brain cancer and leukemia. The bill is expected to increase launch prices of drugs according to a CBO analysis.

Polling shows that a majority of Americans disapprove of the state of the economy under President Biden. Even he regrets naming the bill the Inflation Reduction Act, since it ultimately “has less to do with inflation.” Republicans warned this Inflation Expansion Act was, in fact, a massive down payment on the Green New Deal that would fail to strengthen our economy and continue to make life unaffordable for people.

Here are some of the worst provisions from President Biden’s Inflation Expansion Act:

A natural gas tax. It’s a tax on every part of our lives. This burdensome tax harms communities and shuts down production. This has done nothing to ease prices for Americans from heating homes and buying goods, to manufacturing thousands of essential, everyday products, the cost of living is still higher for people than it was when he first took office. President Biden’s latest efforts to ban natural gas stoves and appliances doubles down on this war on American energy.

An EPA-run climate bank. It’s an unaccountable $27-billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded slush fund for liberal pet projects and Democratic cronies. It fails to ensure accountability or transparency in how the resources are used, heightening the risk for overspending, fraud, and abuse. Furthermore, loopholes in the bill’s electric vehicle tax provisions will lead to an increased reliance on China.

An EPA school bus and garbage truck program. The program is a $1 billion giveaway that Americans were forced to foot the bill for. Reportedly, the school busses hardly work.

DOE Loan Guarantee Program is Solyndra on steroids. $250-billion-dollars—expensed to the taxpayer—in government handouts to fund the Left’s rush-to-green pet projects. This amount of spending is unprecedented. Meanwhile, hardworking Americans are paying more across the board than when President Biden took office and cannot afford for the administration to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a political agenda that forces an expensive energy transition, threatens energy reliability, increases costs, and makes America reliant on the Chinese Communist Party.

The Democrats’ drug pricing scheme. The scheme means less innovation and fewer cures, as well as increased reliance on Chinese medical manufacturing and supply chains. Drug developers have already suspended development of medicines to treat multiple blood cancers. It’s expected to lead to higher launch prices, meaning more expensive drugs for patients.

House Republicans are leading on solutions to combat the consequences of the Far-Left Inflation Expansion Act and make life better for the American people.

H.R. 1. Earlier this year, House Republicans passed H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, to unleash American energy production and help bring down energy costs. H.R. 1 would claw back the Democrats’ $27-billion-dollar climate bank and repeal the natural gas tax, while lifting barriers to expanding our energy supplies and build more pipelines. This is just one part of House Republicans’ all-of-the-above energy approach to secure American jobs and ensure energy is affordable and reliable for people across the country.

Protecting Gas Stoves. With strong bipartisan votes, Republicans also passed H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, and H.R. 1615, the Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act, to stop President Biden’s de facto ban on natural gas cooking appliances and protect Americans’ choices, wallets, and jobs.

Access to Care: Just last month, Chair Rodgers released a discussion draft of policies designed to mitigate drug shortages and preserve access to care for patients who rely on medicines with currently fragile supply chains.

Oversight. President Biden spent an unprecedented amount of taxpayer dollars through his Inflation Expansion Act, and Americans have a right to know exactly how that money is being spent. Energy and Commerce Republicans are conducting thorough oversight efforts to ensure tax dollars aren’t being wasted, abused, or used in fraudulent ways.

President Biden’s approval ratings have remained low since earlier this summer, with 42% approving of his handling of his job as president overall and just 36% approving of his handling of the economy. Forty-two percent also rate his handling of foreign policy as good. The AP-NORC poll conducted in June found similar results: 41% approved of his overall job performance and 34% approved of his handling of the economy.

Among Democrats, 65% approve of Biden’s handling of the economy and 76% approve of how he’s handling his job as president overall, but approval is much lower among younger Democrats. Just 52% of Democrats under age 45 approve of how he is handling the economy, while 77% of older adults approve. And only 68% of Democrats under 45 rate his handling of his job as good compared to 84% of those older than 45.

When it comes to Biden’s ability to effectively perform key functions of the presidency, a majority of the public has hardly any confidence in his ability to reduce corruption in the government, and many have similar views regarding his ability to manage the White House, handle a crisis or achieve major policy goals.

In addition to having low confidence in Biden’s abilities, the public largely opposes him running for president again in 2024, with only 24% saying they would want him to do so. Despite viewing Biden’s job performance positively, over half of Democrats (55%) do not want Biden to run for president in 2024, although 82% say they would support him if he were the nominee. Younger Democrats are much more likely to be against him seeking re-election, with 66% of those under the age of 45 saying they would not want him to run again compared to 45% of those older than 45. However, 77% of young Democrats still report they would most likely support Biden if we were selected as the party’s nominee.

Overall, the public’s perception of the direction of the country remains pessimistic, as does their view of the economy. Seventy-four percent of the public believes the country is heading in the wrong direction, and just 34% describe the economy as good. However, Democrats have a more optimistic view of the economy than Republicans (52% vs. 15%).

The nationwide poll was conducted August 10-14, 2023 using the AmeriSpeak® Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,165 adults. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3.8 percentage points.

The White House is going all in on ""Bidenomics"" branding as the 2024 election cycle heats up.

President Joe Biden took his economic philosophy, which emphasizes building the economy from the middle out and bottom up, on the road with a speech Wednesday at the Old Post Office Building in downtown Chicago.

""The trickle-down approach failed the middle class,"" Biden said. ""It failed America.""

Despite the billing, the president seemed hesitant at first about using the term ""Bidenomics"" -- arguing it was one first coined by the news media. “I didn't come up with the name. I really didn’t. I now claim it but they're the ones who used it first,"" he said.

""I think it's a plan that I’m happy to call Bidenomics,” he then insisted, outlining a three-pronged approach aimed at placing low-income and middle-class families in a stronger financial position.

""First, making smart investments in America. Second, educating and empowering American workers to grow the middle class. And third, promoting competition to lower costs and help small businesses,"" he said.

In the 35-minute address, Biden touted the jobs and investments created as a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. He took aim at Republicans, Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama in particular, for recently celebrating the impacts of the infrastructure law despite voting against it.

""I think it’s going to help lessen the division in this country by bringing us back together,"" Biden told the crowd of ""Bidenomics."" ""It makes it awful hard to demagogue something when it's working.""

The official push by the White House on Biden's economic message -- a rebranding of the ideas he's articulated for years -- comes as polls show the president under water with voters on economic issues after a year of persistent inflation, which has recently eased, and high interest rates.

Republican presidential hopefuls frequently hit Biden over the economy, accusing him of fueling higher prices with big spending packages and harming corporations through so-called ""woke"" policies.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll last month found Americans 54-36% said former President Donald Trump did a better job handling the economy when he was in office than Biden has done so far.

Biden on Wednesday largely focused on positive economic news, touting the unemployment rate hitting a historic low earlier this year and a cooling in inflation, though prices remain higher than when he entered office.

""Bringing down inflation remains one of my top priorities,"" Biden said Wednesday. He said his attempts to bring down prescription drug costs and eliminate junk fees are two examples of providing Americans with more financial breathing room.

The administration's recently been buoyed by a May jobs report that showed payrolls grew by 339,000, beating expectations. Consumer prices rose 4% in May compared to a year ago, also a better figure than anticipated, and down from the 40-year high of more than 9% last year.

But the branding could carry political risk, if the economy worsens.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the U.S. economy has been ""quite resilient."" Powell said a recession ""remains possible"" but is not the most likely scenario. On inflation, the fed chairman said the U.S. won't meet the target 2% core inflation before 2025 and didn't rule out raising interest rates to tamp down prices.

Biden, when leaving the White House, said he doesn't believe there will be a recession.

Looking ahead, Biden vowed to continue fighting for universal pre-K and free college, as well as bringing down child care costs and addressing tax loopholes that prevent the wealthy from ""paying their fair share.""

""I'm not here to declare victory on the economy but we have a plan [that is] turning things around incredibly quickly,"" Biden said. ""We have more work to do."""

Members stressed that President Biden’s radical, costly, and burdensome regulatory agenda is a dramatic expansion of Executive Branch power and will cost American taxpayers at least $1.5 trillion dollars over the next decade. Members noted that the Biden Administration has also targeted the Trump Administration’s many meaningful, necessary, and cost-saving deregulatory actions. They concluded that America’s small businesses, workers and communities should be provided tools to achieve economic success and the committee will pursue legislative solutions to ensure commonsense regulatory reform.

Key Takeaways:

The Biden Administration has morphed into a red tape regime that jeopardizes Americans’ ability to secure quality jobs, costs families more of their hard-earned money, and hurts small businesses.

Mr. Casey Mulligan, Professor, University of Chicago: “The most notorious cost of regulation is the paperwork, sometimes known as ‘red tape.’ The federal executive branch alone issues thousands of new regulations each year that add to the 200,000 pages of federal rules already in place. One finding is that the rules finalized by the Biden Administration through the end of 2022 impose costs of nearly $10,000 per household, which is $1,300 more than the burden of the Obama Administration rules during the comparable timeframe.”

Mr. Anthony Campau, Principal, Clark Hill Public Strategies: “The U.S. federal government is now issuing more rules at a higher price tag and a faster clip than ever before. According to one study, at its halfway point, the current administration had already imposed $318 billion in total regulatory costs and 218 million hours of annual paperwork burdens, as compared with the $208.7 billion of regulatory costs and 131 million hours of paperwork the Obama Administration had imposed over that same period.”

The Biden Administration’s regulatory overreach subverts Congress, aims to derail effective Trump Administration reforms, and will cost American taxpayers trillions of dollars over the next decade.

Mr. Casey Mulligan, Professor, University of Chicago: “The Biden Administration has so far been adding regulatory costs at a rate of $617 billion per year of rulemaking, not counting regulatory costs created by statutes and other non-rule regulatory actions. President Trump’s approach not only avoided adding costs, but subtracted them. The cost savings from eight years of President Trump’s approach compared to President Biden’s is up to $80,000 per household.”

Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.): “It is estimated that just three of the Biden Administration’s rules will cause $1.5 trillion to be spent over the next decade. We know what that means for businesses and consumers: higher costs of doing business, higher prices, and fewer choices in the marketplace. And we know that this overreach will only continue the expansion of Executive Branch power at the expense of the American people.”

Congress has a responsibility to ensure a commonsense, efficient, and results-driven regulatory system. The Oversight Committee will continue to hold the Biden Administration accountable for its extreme regulatory overreach and pursue legislative solutions to ensure commonsense regulatory reform.

Mr. Adam White, Senior Fellow, American Enterprise Institute: “Congress could legislate binding procedures and standards for the agencies’ regulatory impact analyses, ensuring quality and consistency across presidencies, through amendments to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Congress could also consider requiring agencies to regularly undertake ‘retrospective review’ of existing rules, which could spur agencies to reform outdated or unjustifiable regulations, and at the very least would improve agencies’ evaluation of new rules going forward.”

Mr. Anthony Campau, Principal, Clark Hill Public Strategies: “The basic practices and procedures of the regulatory development process should not seesaw back and forth. Congress should step in and make the common-sense regulatory process reforms of the Trump Administration permanent.”

Member Highlights:

Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) emphasized that successful regulatory reforms implemented under the Trump Administration are being tossed aside in favor of a radical, excessive regulatory agenda. He stressed the importance of limiting bureaucratic regulations to help Americans and small businesses create, innovate, and thrive.

Chairman Comer: “The prior administration implemented substantial reforms to limit regulatory overreach, producing great economic success. President Biden ran on being a ‘unifying’ president, but instead he has used his platform to strip away those regulatory reforms we know were positively impacting the economy and replaced them with historic levels of new red tape. The Biden Administration wasted no time eliminating deregulatory policies and instead cleared the way for President Biden’s radical, costly, and burdensome agenda. When America isn’t tied down with red tape, or buried under heaps of federal paperwork, America’s small businesses, workers and communities are capable of soaring to new heights of prosperity.”

Chairman Comer pointed out that Congress has a responsibility to consider effective regulatory reforms. He noted that the Biden Administration’s regulatory blitz has also flown in the face of recent Supreme Court rulings.

Chairman Comer: “What a noble concept to put the power of regulating in the hands of Congress. It’s my understanding that President Trump reduced regulatory costs almost as fast as President Biden and President Obama added them. I’m concerned that some of the biggest new Biden regulations fly in the face of the Supreme Court’s decision last year in West Virginia vs. EPA . This is a big issue in my District. Do you share this concern?”

Mr. White: “I do.”

Chairman Comer: “What could the lasting consequences be?”

Mr. White: “There could be a lot of soft resistance to future decisions. It makes congressional oversight and legislative powers all the more important.”

Chairman Comer: “We support commonsense regulations. We need to examine, evaluate, and seek input on burdensome and costly regulations. Right now, there is no input from the private sector and unelected bureaucrats are now pushing devastating regulations.”

Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) stated that the Biden Administration’s regulatory push is out of control. She noted that federal rules and regulations should not be a significant cost burden on American families and businesses.

Rep. Foxx: “The Biden Administration has displayed a pattern of grossly underestimating the cost of new regulations while greatly exaggerating the purported benefits by gaming the current system. We need to make sure that federal regulations do not unduly burden families and job creators and slow our economic engine. The cost in the Biden Administration is about 10,000 dollars per household of rules and regulations. This is really a staggering burden. Is there anything the Administration has done to justify this absurd regulatory burden?”

Professor Mulligan: “No… they have not.” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) stressed that regulatory overreach is an ongoing issue and hurts countless American businesses.

Rep. Biggs: “I thought I would just bring up some things we regulate. You check out the ketchup regulations lately? Ketchup regulations define what ketchup is. Normally we let the marketplace determine that… Ketchup regulations are not designed necessarily for safety. A lot of ketchup regulations are about just thickness. How about this one. Let’s look at cheese. It’s pages and pages of regulations that have nothing to do with even cheese safety. Buns! Hamburger buns. They’re regulated. Everything comes back to excessive regulations… This is overreach.”

Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) pointed out that economic opportunities are being jeopardized by regulatory overreach. He highlighted how regulations severely impact small businesses attempting to navigate the marketplace.

Rep. Grothman: “The cost of new regulations is high. Business owners are telling me today they could have never started their company today because of all these regulations. It would make it impossible to start the company today… If you have six factories with a thousand employees, you can adapt to regulations more than a startup with 40 employees.”

Mr. White: “Surely large companies would like to do away with regulations, but at the very least they know they are in a better position to bear the costs. A lot of these regulatory frameworks force consolidation that creates a lack of competition and reinforces a lot of economic problems we see today.”

Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) emphasized that reasonable regulations are effective, but excessive regulations pushed by President Biden are burdensome and disrupting economic opportunities for all Americans.

Rep. Fallon: “Limited government, low taxes, and reasonable regulation. This is why I ran for office in the first place because I believe in these things. We heard earlier that we are anti-regulation. That is patently absurd. We are for reasonable regulation. There is a thing called over-regulation… You get crushed as a small business under excessive regulation. Under Joe Biden, agencies across the government have been implementing crippling and costly regulations at a record pace. This hurts low-income communities. It has real consequences. It cost taxpayers more in the long run. Do you trust unelected bureaucrats, or do you trust the American people more? I trust the American people. There needs to be a balance. This is why we need to support reasonable regulations. What are some examples of downstream impacts for excessive regulations?”

Professor Mulligan: “Higher prices.”

Rep. Fallon: “They clearly increase prices. Do you think it has a disproportionate impact to small businesses too?”

Professor Mulligan: “Absolutely.”

Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) stressed that the Biden Administration’s regulatory blitz is a clear effort to dramatically expand the power of the Executive Branch and subvert Congress.

Rep. Fry: “Since taking office, the Biden Administration has usurped Congress and used an incredible amount of authority to push their liberal agenda and fundamentally change the makeup of this country. Think about it, they have gone after law-abiding gun owners, push ridiculous regulations on all businesses, prioritize ESG standards over Americans’ retirement funds, push green energy over practical energy, decided Americans shouldn’t own gas stoves, and even feel the need to regulate puddles. The Executive Branch feels emboldened to expand their regulatory power over what Congress intended. Government agencies never should act like this. Congress has this role. The House has passed resolutions rebuking the Administration’s regulatory overreach. Has the Administration made any effort to halt this overreach?”

Mr. White: “No sir, in fact I am concerned by a number of agencies that are thwarting even the Supreme Court’s decisions. This is a transformative agenda.”

Larry Summers, the former Obama and Clinton official, slammed parts of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda as “increasingly dangerous” this week, saying it could end up causing higher prices for Americans.

“I am profoundly concerned by the doctrine of manufacturing-centered economic nationalism that is increasingly put forth as a general principle to guide policy,” Summers said on Tuesday while speaking virtually at an event held by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Specifically, Summers took issue with the administration’s trade stance, efforts to prop up US manufacturing and its antitrust crackdown. The former Harvard president argued this approach could prove to be inflationary.

“It is wrong to suppose that manufacturing-based economic nationalism is a route to higher incomes or better standards of living for the middle class,” Summers said.

“Bidenomics is a fundamental break from trickle-down economics, which underinvested in the American people and our competitiveness,” White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa told CNN in a statement in response to the Summers criticism. “The pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine made clear that supply chains and critical resources can be easily disrupted, hurting consumers, workers, and the entire economy.”

The White House spokesperson added that Biden’s investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and semiconductors “are not just creating new factories and jobs, they are making our economy more resilient.”

Manufacturing on the rise

Biden has made reviving American manufacturing a central part of his economic agenda. Biden signed into law legislation that incentivizes domestic manufacturing around clean energy, computer chips and other areas.

The White House has hailed a surge in private investment in American manufacturing under Biden’s watch.

“It used to be: find the cheapest market in the world, send the job overseas, and bring the product back. Not on my watch. Right here, we’re doing — we’re creating jobs in America, and we’re exporting American products,” Biden said during a speech about “Bidenomics” in Philadelphia last month.

Booming manufacturing investment has helped boost the US economy, with Morgan Stanley economists citing that as a key reason for their brighter economic projections.

Summers said he agrees with a “large part of” what the administration has done, including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, which sought to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

“I believe those two signature items of Biden policies were appropriate steps,” Summers said.

Inflation concerns persist

However, the famed economist and former president emeritus of Harvard University, and former Secretary of the Treasury, is taking issue with the doctrine behind those policies.

“We do not have a problem of a shortfall of jobs,” Summers said, noting that the number of open jobs relative to people looking for work remains high. “We do have a problem of costs.”

High inflation has hurt workers by eating into their paychecks. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, have declined, making it harder for Americans to get by.

Summers argued that globalization and the reduction of trade barriers have helped consumers by lowering inflation and ushering in a period of low interest rates.

“That is why I am so concerned by the administration’s attitudes, or non-attitudes, toward trade,” he said.

On the antitrust front, last week the Biden administration released new guidelines that signal officials plan to continue a tough approach when it comes to stopping harmful mergers.

“Unchecked consolidation threatens the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based,” Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement last week. “These updated merger guidelines respond to modern market realities and will enable the Justice Department to transparently and effectively protect the American people from the damage that anticompetitive mergers cause.”

Summers, however, argued that the new guidelines “discard” a long-standing focus on lowering consumer costs when it comes to antitrust actions.

“Yes, we should enforce the antitrust law more than we have over the last 30 years,” Summers said. “But we should do that in service of a doctrine of higher incomes through lower costs for consumers.”"

And so was the May data the month before that. But even as the U.S. emerges from the iron grip of inflation, President Biden and his signature ""Bidenomics"" approach are getting little credit. Perhaps unfairly, shouldering the blame for an underperforming economy is a typical pitfall of the presidency — yet so is owning the political boon that comes with a healthy one. And Biden, for all his attempts, is struggling to convince the public that he deserves some kudos on that front; As of July 13, just 38.7% of Americans approved of the way he was handling the economy, according to a polling average from RealClearPolitics. Why are voters so reluctant to give the president his flowers?

It's a messaging problem

Unlike other presidents, like Ronald Reagan (against whose ""Reagonomics"" Biden has contrasted his own plan), Uncle Joe isn't as strong of a salesman, John Feehery, a former GOP aide, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""He's not a very good messenger,"" Feehery said. ""Biden doesn't really get credit for being a job creator. He's a politician and people don't like giving credit to politicians."" The White House must also be ""more forceful and more cogent in the argument that the economy is humming and moving along,"" added Mo Butler, a Democratic consultant from New Jersey. ""You hear fragments of a compelling message but you don't have the message yet.""

Meanwhile, MSNBC's Chris Hayes' has a different-but-related theory as to why ""Bidenomics"" is lacking in positive press: The sectors having the worst time economically as of late ""also happen to be the ones closest to the megaphones,"" specifically the media and tech companies responsible for providing the public with news about the economy, he speculated on ""All In with Chris Hayes."" Meanwhile, those who have seen the ""greatest relative economic gains"" are those ""at the very bottom"" of the totem pole and the ""least influential in the national conversation about the economy.""

To that end, the media, against which most Americans hedge their judgments about the state of the nation, has been particularly doomsday about the economy. People can't believe Biden is doing a good job on the economy because ""it isn't what the business press tells them,"" said The National Review's Timothy Noah. ""When it comes to awareness of 'the economy,'"" added Paul Waldman in The Washington Post, ""people have very little to go on from their individual lives"" and instead use the media to learn ""what's happening in the country as a whole."" And throughout ""much of Biden's term,"" the debate in the media has ""pitted Republicans saying that we're living through an economic catastrophe against Biden and his allies saying, A lot of people are suffering out there, we know it's bad, but we're making progress."" That constant capitulation, combined with GOP negging, certainly hasn't bolstered voter confidence.

It's a time and perception problem

""Although inflation has been falling for nearly a year,"" John Cassidy wrote for The New Yorker, ""the process has been gradual, and people may be only starting to notice."" Most of the public also tends to watch ""individual price levels"" rather than the specific inflation rate, and many of those ""remain considerably higher than they were when Biden took office.""

""The vast majority of U.S. workers did not lose their jobs during the Covid downturn,"" added Eric Levitz in The Intelligencer. ""Therefore, they did not experience the labor market's rapid recovery as a reprieve from precarity."" Instead, this post-pandemic period has been characterized by ""falling real wages, as prices have grown faster than paychecks."" As a result, ""for most U.S. voters, Bidenomics has yet to deliver unambiguous economic improvement."" (Worth noting: Wage growth in June ""rapidly outpaced"" inflation for the first time since March 2021, though that data was released six days after the publication of Levitz' article).

The American public is also probably just shell-shocked after a tumultuous three years, and not ready to let its guard down. ""Just think of what the American people have just been through,"" Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, said at the end of last month, citing the coronavirus pandemic and the spike in energy prices that came as a result of the Russo-Ukrainian war. ""Those are pretty traumatic economic events, and it's going to take a while for people to feel really confident and secure."""
341,Biden-Harris Administration Protects Boundary Waters Area Watershed - US Department of the Interior,Biden-Harris Administration Protects Boundary Waters Area Watershed  US Department of the Interior,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 19:10:03 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvaS5nb3YvcHJlc3NyZWxlYXNlcy9iaWRlbi1oYXJyaXMtYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24tcHJvdGVjdHMtYm91bmRhcnktd2F0ZXJzLWFyZWEtd2F0ZXJzaGVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,US Department of the Interior,"WASHINGTON – Today, the Biden-Harris administration took action to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and surrounding watershed, a spectacular network of rivers, lakes and forests in northeastern Minnesota that comprise the most heavily visited wilderness area in the United States.

Responding to concerns regarding the potential impacts of mining on the area’s watershed, fish and wildlife, Tribal and treaty rights, and robust recreation economy, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland signed Public Land Order 7917 withdrawing approximately 225,504 acres in the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota from disposition under the United States mineral and geothermal leasing laws for a 20-year period, subject to valid existing rights. This action will help protect the Rainy River watershed, including the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and the 1854 Ceded Territory of the Chippewa Bands, from the potential adverse impacts of new mineral and geothermal exploration and development.

“The Department of the Interior takes seriously our obligations to steward public lands and waters on behalf of all Americans. Protecting a place like Boundary Waters is key to supporting the health of the watershed and its surrounding wildlife, upholding our Tribal trust and treaty responsibilities, and boosting the local recreation economy,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. “With an eye toward protecting this special place for future generations, I have made this decision using the best-available science and extensive public input.”

“I applaud Secretary Haaland’s decision to protect the long-term health of the Rainy River watershed, including the irreplaceable Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “This landscape is an international resource renowned for its multitude of recreational opportunities and provides millions of visitors with unparalleled wilderness experiences.”

Today’s decision is the culmination of more than a year of evaluation by federal partners and robust public involvement regarding the potential impacts of mining on the important natural and cultural resources of the Rainy River Watershed.

In October 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service submitted a withdrawal application to the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management, which manages the subsurface mineral estate under the national forest. Extensive public input was sought on the requested withdrawal, and the Forest Service conducted a science-based environmental assessment to evaluate the potential impacts of prohibiting new mineral and geothermal exploration and development within the Rainy River watershed for the next 20 years. The analysis and decision were informed by approximately 225,000 comments gathered from two public comment periods, three virtual public meetings and two Tribal consultations.

More than 150,000 visitors from around the world every year are drawn to the 1.1-million-acre Boundary Waters, the only lake-land wilderness in the National Wilderness Preservation System. It boasts more than 1,200 miles of canoe routes, 12 hiking trails, and 2,000 designated campsites, and contributes up to $17.4 million annually to the more than $540 million recreation and tourism economies in Cook, Lake and St. Louis counties.

Located adjacent to Voyageurs National Park, Grand Portage National Monument, and Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario, the area contains over 1,100 lakes, interspersed with islands and surrounded by forests that extend nearly 150 miles along the border with Canada. Congress expanded protections for the wilderness area in 1978, when it directed the Forest Service to maintain high water quality and to minimize “to the maximum extent possible” the environmental impacts associated with mineral development.

The public land order withdrawing portions of the Superior National Forest from operation of the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights, is authorized by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The Secretary of the Interior has the authority to withdraw this area for a maximum of 20 years, subject to renewal. Only Congress can legislate a permanent withdrawal.

Today’s action builds upon decades of local efforts to protect the landscape, watershed and the outdoor recreation economy they support. This is consistent with the principles of President Biden’s America the Beautiful initiative to support locally led conservation and restoration efforts.

A map of the area is available on the BLM’s website. Additional information on the Forest Service’s application and related environmental analysis is available online the Forest Service’s website.

President Joe Biden on Wednesday formally unveiled “Bidenomics,” the ground-up economic philosophy he claims serves as the driving force behind the US economy’s success.

When an economy grows “from the middle out and the bottom up instead of just the top down… everybody does well,” Biden said in a speech from Chicago.

But the economy’s track record under Biden is anything but flawless. And while Biden’s growing list of Republican challengers differ on many issues, when it comes to the economy, they’re in agreement that Biden failed.

In reality, it’s a mixed bag.

Americans have grappled with inflation for more than a year, including a painstaking issue with housing affordability as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 10 times in a row to bring that inflation down.

In addition, a tight labor market has left many small businesses with ongoing hiring difficulties. Meanwhile, in anticipation of a recession, large companies have tightened their belts and resized their workforce by laying off thousands of workers.

But it hasn’t all been bad. American workers have rejoiced in a robust labor market that has allowed them to quit their jobs for a better one — one that can pay them more or allow them the flexibility of working from home.

Many Americans were given a financial boost during the Covid pandemic in the form of stimulus checks and a break from student loan payments, although the latter are restarting later this year.

The economy evolved immensely during and after the pandemic. Here’s what Biden can take credit for – and what he can’t.

Fiscal largesse

Some major spending packages passed by Congress did happen under Biden’s watch — from the American Rescue Plan to the Inflation Reduction Act — funneling trillions of dollars toward infrastructure, workforce development, state and local governments and the costly public health response to Covid.

While government spending bolsters consumer demand, it also boosts business investment. Manufacturers’ spending on construction has soared in recent months due to funding Congress approved for infrastructure.

The Treasury Department released an analysis this week that showed the increase in construction spending from manufacturers has been “principally driven by construction for computer, electronic, and electrical manufacturing” and that “the surge appears to be uniquely American — not mirrored in other advanced economies.”

Biden can claim credit for that, but until manufacturers begin to hire workers at a solid clip, it’s hard for Biden to declare there’s a manufacturing boom.

For now, demand for goods has slowed in the United States and other major economies, according to business surveys from S&P Global and the Institute for Supply Management.

In other aspects, the labor market certainly had a boost from Biden’s fiscal policies. The American Rescue plan provided $40 billion toward workforce development, funneled through state and local governments, which aimed to address demographic disparities and invested in the public health workforce.

Still, the economic outlook remains uncertain. While Biden joked Wednesday that he has heard people “forecast the possibility of a recession for 24 months, and it hasn’t happened,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a central banker panel Wednesday he is not ruling out a recession. However, some economists and bank CEOs think a recession could come later than expected.

Plentiful jobs and record low unemployment — but not all thanks to Biden

Since Biden took office in January 2021, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7% from 6.3%. All the jobs that were lost due to the pandemic-induced recession were fully restored last summer. Since then, the American workforce has consistently outpaced the pre-pandemic workforce.

However, the labor market had begun to make a comeback well before Biden’s inauguration. Many of the job gains during his presidency were likely a continuation of the bounce-back effect that came as the economy reopened.

Americans are also earning more. Since Biden became president, average hourly earnings have risen by 12% to $33.44, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although that is also connected to the pace of post-pandemic recovery.

And, as Biden pointed out Wednesday, several polls indicate job satisfaction is at a record high.

That said, the labor market is unbalanced.

There are almost 4 million more job openings than the number of people looking for work. That has forced employers to raise wages to lure in more workers.

Biden sees that as a victory. “Pay for low-wage workers is growing at the fastest pace in over two decades,” he said Wednesday.

However, the Fed is less gung-ho about those wage increases, since they’re feeding directly into inflation.

Is Biden to blame for inflation?

Republicans have repeatedly slammed Biden for decades-high inflation, decrying it as the consequence of out-of-control government spending. The causes of inflation are nuanced, but a faction of economists and analysts argue that generous government spending played some role.

Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chair who helmed the central bank during the Great Recession, and Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, argued in a paper presented at the Brookings Institution in May that inflation’s eruption was first driven by shortages and energy prices.

But the two economists asserted that inflation continued to rise because of stimulus-fueled demand and low interest rates.

Although the spending packages passed under Biden are not the main culprits behind inflation – war in Ukraine and the pandemic played a huge part – government spending did play some role. It’s just no longer a source of inflation.

“I will add, though, without crossing any lines, that the spending during the pandemic was very high and it’s come down — and so we look at the fiscal impulse from the level of spending and it’s really not material. It may even be slightly contraction, but let’s just say it’s flat,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday during a panel hosted by the European Central Bank. “If you look at where the inflation is in the economy, I wouldn’t say that that’s an important driver of inflation or something that we think about or consider.”

Inflation has in fact retreated from the four-decade high in June 2022, in large part due to falling energy prices, but Bernanke’s paper argued that the economy needs to slow further to address the labor market’s persistent impact on inflation.

Biden’s response to the inflation criticism is that it’s worse in other major economies.

Americans are in more debt than ever

Whether or not Biden is to blame for inflation, it’s undeniable that it has created financial hardships for Americans.

Household debt is at a $17 trillion record high, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

That’s a 16% increase from when Biden took office.

Americans are piling on debt and struggling to make loan repayments on time as inflation continues to erode the value of their paychecks.

It’s clear that Americans have been remarkably resilient in the face of high inflation, punishing rate hikes, persistent housing unaffordability, economic uncertainty and an unforgiving pandemic that upended every facet of society. Biden should be given credit whenever it is due, but so should everyday Americans."

President Joe Biden’s top economic advisers believe the worst effects of inflation are in the rear-view mirror. They are increasingly confident the economy is heading for a soft-landing, averting a recession. And a growing number of economists are beginning to agree.

There’s just one problem: most Americans are convinced the economy is in bad shape, and they blame the president.

Enter “Bidenomics.”

Searching for a solution to Americans’ negative perception of the economy and a vehicle to take credit for an economy that is increasingly trending in the right direction – all as Biden’s reelection campaign gets underway – the White House is embracing the term.

“Bidenomics” was at the heart of a major economic speech the president delivered Wednesday in Chicago, where he ticked through positive economic indicators and outlined a vision of economic revival.

“I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics,” Biden said at the Old Chicago Main Post Office.

“I didn’t come up with a name,” he said, crediting the news media for inventing the term Bidenomics. “I really didn’t. I now claim it.”

Ahead of the speech, aides described the address as an opportunity for Biden to lay out his economic vision for the future while also articulating how he believes his economic policies have delivered so far.

But it was also an opportunity for Biden to explain what his economic policy was not.

“Folks, let me say as clearly as I can, the trickle-down approach failed the middle class. It failed America, blew up the deficit, increased inequity and weakened our infrastructure,” he said.

Throughout his speech, Biden took aim at his predecessor for failing to accomplish what he’d promised, including improving the nation’s infrastructure.

And he vowed to continue pressing for tax increases on the wealthy and expanding childcare and education access, both items he’s unsuccessfully sought during his first term.

Those items are opposed by many Republicans, but Biden said his agenda could unify Americans.

“I think we’re going to help lessen the division in this country by bringing us back together,” he said. “It makes it awful hard to demagogue something when it’s working.”

White House officials have been preparing a more comprehensive economic messaging push for months and the decision to launch now reflects the White House’s settled confidence that the economy’s positive trajectory is sustainable. The debt ceiling impasse also needed to be resolved and Biden’s key economic legislation needed to begin to be implemented.

Now, officials see Bidenomics as an opportunity to tie together the president’s economic accomplishments, the vision behind those policies and a growing economy under one term.

“Bidenomics is rooted in the simple idea that we need to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top down,” reads a bolded section of a memo distributed by two of the president’s senior advisers, Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon, earlier this week.

That Dunn and Donilon are messaging experts and not economists is a telling sign of the origins of “Bidenomics” as partly a branding exercise. Aides are hopeful a more concerted effort to convince Americans of the economy’s strength – and Biden’s own role in managing it – will improve his political standing.

How much a new name can help in that effort remains to be seen. Biden has been traveling the country for the better part of two years talking about his efforts to boost manufacturing, invest in new infrastructure and create job training programs for Americans without college degrees.

Though polls show Americans broadly support elements of Biden’s economic agenda – a point Dunn and Donilon made in their three-page memo – a wide swath of Americans continue to widely disapprove of how he’s handled the economy: 66%, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in May.

That same poll showed most Americans view the economy as lackluster, with 76% describing it as in poor shape, up from 71% who felt that way in March.

Asked about the disconnect between increasingly positive economic data and Americans’ perceptions of the economy, Biden’s chief economic adviser Lael Brainard pointed to the “record economic uncertainty” that Americans have faced over the last two years as the country emerged from the pandemic and experienced the knock-on effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“What the president would say is people need to see it. They need to see it in their communities. And that’s what his policies are all about,” Brainard said in an interview. “As Americans see that and experience it, the president is confident that they are going to feel much more optimistic about their own economic futures.”

While the president’s top messaging advisers home in on the “Bidenomics” term as a way to lift up his economic record and contrast it with Republican economic policies, the prominent push also runs the risk of Republicans co-opting it to describe the not-so-bright spots in the current economy or to tie the president to the still-looming possibility of another economic downturn.

“It’s really not about a term,” Brainard said when asked about how Republicans might co-opt it. “It’s not about a word. It’s about an economic plan that the president has put in place that is in contrast with trickle down (policies).”

“Listen, even if the economy is doing well, the Republicans will say it’s doing poorly,” Dunn, the president’s senior adviser, said on MSNBC earlier this week. “So, we’re not going to spend a huge amount of time worrying about them.”

Attaching a “-nomics” to the end of a president’s name has been routine since President Richard Nixon. As often as not, it’s used as a pejorative by opponents; nothing helps simplify something as complicated as a bad economy than a buzzword.

No president has been more associated with a “-nomics” than Ronald Reagan, whose “Reaganomics” described a supply-side, trickle-down approach that has largely defined Republican economic policy for the last 40 years.

Biden has made little attempt at disguising his distaste for that approach; he’s made a part of his stump speech a takedown of policies he insists will never benefit middle-class, blue-collar workers.

“Not a lot trickled down to my parents’ kitchen table when I was growing up,” Biden has said in various forms over the past several years (never mind that Biden was in his 40s during Reagan’s attempt at trickle-down economics).

Bidenomics, at least in the White House’s definition, is as much identified by what it is not as it is by a particular set of policies or ideas.

“If Reaganomics was based on the idea that if you cut taxes for the wealthiest corporations, the wealthiest people in this society, and that at some point, the remnants of those will trickle down to the middle class and the working class, Bidenomics is the exact opposite. Bidenomics says that the way to grow the economy in this country is you grow the middle class,” Dunn said on MSNBC.

Biden himself seemed surprised this month that his surname had achieved “-nomics” status.

“I didn’t realize I had Bidenomics going,” he said during a news conference with his British counterpart on June 8, suggesting he’d learned the term in the pages of the Wall Street Journal.

Ten days later – as the White House put the final touches on the forthcoming messaging push – he hadn’t seemed to achieve any more clarity on what, exactly, this theory of his was.

“We decided to replace this theory (trickle-down economics) with what the press has now called ‘Bidenomics,’” he said during a political rally with union members in Philadelphia. “I don’t know what the hell that is. But it’s working.”

But when faced with the question of whether “Bidenomics” can be the answer to changing public perception of the president’s record, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered a frank reply: “We’re going to try. Right?”"

It’s been hard for voters to digest the mix of roads-and-bridges spending, tax hikes on big companies, tax credits for parents, tax breaks for renewable energy, grants to build computer chip factories, insulin price caps and slogans like “Build Back Better.”

And that barely covers the full breadth of what the administration is doing and trying to do.

Last week, the president gave a speech on “Bidenomics” in hopes that the term will lodge in voters’ minds ahead of the 2024 elections. But what is Bidenomics? Let’s just say the White House definition is different from the Republican one — evidence that catchphrases can be double-edged.

Biden says his economic philosophy is the opposite of a Republican approach that favors broad tax cuts to spur growth. He sees the government as using the tax code in a more targeted fashion and fashioning other programs to foster investment in new technologies, create jobs and boost upward mobility. He wants to do more to educate workers and foster competition within the U.S. economy in hopes of reducing prices.

“I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics to what everyone in The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times began to call ‘Bidenomics,’” the president said. “I didn’t come up with the name. I really didn’t.”

But to Republicans, “Bidenomics” is a slur they can deploy. It’s a philosophy of government spending and anti-oil policies that they say fueled a spike in inflation last summer to a four-decade high. High prices have left U.S. adults deeply pessimistic about the economy, with just 34% approving of Biden’s leadership on the issue, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.

Here’s the latest for Monday July 3rd: Baltimore police search for mass shooting suspects; France deploys thousands of police to stop violent protests; Massive downpour in Chicago; Hotel worker strike in Southern California.

Based on follow-up interviews with poll respondents, they’re far more aware of gasoline and grocery store prices than the details of Biden’s policies. When asked over the course of multiple polls, a few could cite the bipartisan infrastructure package that Biden signed into law. But the Inflation Reduction Act as well as the CHIPS and Science Act have yet to fully surface on the public radar, despite outreach by the administration and news coverage.

GOP lawmakers were faster to embrace the catch-term than the president.

“Instead of priming the pump, Bidenomics has emptied the tank,” future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a 2021 floor speech. “From inflation to gas lines, the American economy today looks more like it did in 1979 than 2019.”

In case you’re wondering, McCarthy’s 1979 dig refers to high prices under then President Jimmy Carter, who in the 1980 election was bested by Republican Ronald Reagan.

A White House official, insisting on anonymity, said the term Bidenomics was not poll-tested.

The administration says it came from media reports, with The New York Times, National Public Radio, Bloomberg News, The Economist, and even AP using it in reports before the president took the oath of office.

Nor is the phrasing all that novel. Commentators have given the American public the portmanteau words Nixonomics, Carternomics, Reaganomics, Clintonomics, Bushonomics, Obamanomics. When the conservative economists Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore wrote a book to describe the policies of then President Donald Trump, they entitled it “Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy.”

President Gerald Ford went with “Whip Inflation Now,” or WIN, in the mid-1970s. Ford’s push had a bit more fanfare than the Bidenomics launch did with the president’s speech this past week at the Old Chicago Main Post Office.

For Ford’s effort, Meredith Willson — famous for writing the musical “The Music Man” — crafted a song entitled ”WIN!” In 1974, The New York Times published the lyrics: “Win! Win! Win! We’ll win together, Win together, that’s, the true American way, today. Who needs inflation? Not this nation.”

But, of course, Biden is trying to offer the country a doctrine rather than a jingle.

Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said the president wants to show the voters that he has plans and solutions for their troubles, not that he’s necessarily fixed everything.

“For 40 years people have been clamoring for an approach to the economy that puts working people at the center instead of prioritizing the wealthy and that’s what he’s delivering on,” Ferguson said. “So the story that he can tell is a different approach to the economy and the proof is in the pudding. It’s also so core to who he is. People believe he’s the guy who’d make the economy work as hard for working people as working people work for the economy.”

“It’s really kind of basic: we just decided to invest in America again,” Biden said Tuesday. “That’s what it’s all about.”

His arrival in Milwaukee came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, a major piece of economic legislation he signed into law with great ceremony but polls show that most people know little about it or what it does. It also occurred a week before Republicans descend on Milwaukee for the party’s first presidential debate. But as Biden spoke, much of the political world was focused on his predecessor, Trump, who was charged late Monday in Georgia on an alleged scheme to illegally overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Wisconsin is among the handful of critical states where Biden needs to persuade voters that his policies are having a positive impact on their lives by generating roughly $500 billion in corporate investments in factories and other facilities. The president ignored Trump in his speech, but he made the economic case personal by directly challenging the state’s Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who was just reelected in 2022 and not up again until 2028.

Biden said that his ideas are in opposition to “the conservative Republican view, the so-called MAGA view, which is focused on corporate profits.”

“But you know who believes that?” the president said. “Your significant Senator Ron Johnson. He believes outsourcing manufacturing jobs is a great thing.”

Other Democrats on Tuesday openly compared Biden’s trip to discuss policy with the legal challenges of Trump, the Republican frontrunner trying to oust him in 2024.

“The contrast between Republicans and us is incredible,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday on a conference call.

Republican lawmakers are focused on criticizing Biden’s economic leadership over inflation hitting a four-decade peak last summer, saying that many U.S. families are still struggling as a result of higher prices.

“Real wages are down and gas prices are up,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said on X, the social media platform formerly known at Twitter. “You are paying the price for failed leadership.”

Biden toured Ingeteam, a clean energy manufacturer of onshore wind turbine generators in Milwaukee, and talked up provisions of the law to boost domestic manufacturing and clean energy, lower health care costs and crack down on billionaires who paying their avoid taxes.

Ingeteam plans to hire 100 workers using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law money to start producing electric vehicle charging stations domestically, according to the White House.

Also timed to Biden’s trip, multinational tech firm Siemens is set to announce that it will start manufacturing solar inverters in Wisconsin’s Kenosha County, a move prompted by increased demand brought by the tax incentives from the IRA law.

Administration officials say the trip is aimed at recognizing the effects of the law, which passed Congress on party-line votes. According to the White House, in Wisconsin, private firms have committed more than $3 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments since Biden was sworn into office.

Some critics of the legislation say provisions of the law could ultimately end up increasing inflation, even though the annual rate of inflation has fallen from 9% last summer to 3.2% in its most recent 12-month reading. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said during a virtual Peterson Institute for International Economics event in July that while he supported the IRA, the Biden administration’s overall economic agenda is “increasingly dangerous.”

“I am profoundly concerned by the doctrine of manufacturing-centered economic nationalism that is increasingly being put forth as a general principle to guide policy,” Summers said.

Vice President Kamala Harris and top Cabinet officials will be fanning out across the country this week to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act and its provisions. Biden has scheduled an anniversary event at the White House on Wednesday.

The president’s stop in Wisconsin comes shortly before Republicans hold their first presidential primary debate in Milwaukee on Aug. 23. Former President Donald Trump — the leading Republican candidate in polls — has yet to say whether he will boycott or hold a competing event.

Democratic gains helped decide a critical state Supreme Court race this spring that moved Wisconsin’s highest court under liberal control for the first time in 15 years. Republicans, though, will compete aggressively in the state, selecting Milwaukee as the site of its 2024 national nominating convention.

Charles Franklin, director of Marquette Law School Poll, said the trip could help Biden win support from independents, who make up about 10% of voters in the state.

“What he really needs to do is get independents in the state to like him a bit better,” Franklin said. “Coming and talking about his achievements, about factories that are working with American jobs — all of that is a good reason to come to speak to those folks in the state who are not partisans.”

“Because Democrats are already behind him,” Franklin said, and “Republicans are almost certainly not going to cross over.”

Lots Of His Own Voters Don’t Believe Him. President Biden’s economic messaging focuses on the middle class, infrastructure investments and job creation. Sam Wolfe / Bloomberg via Getty Images

The economy is doing well. Americans just don’t believe it.

By many metrics — employment, consumer spending and wages — the economic recovery from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic was rapid. But Americans have been displeased with President Biden’s handling of the economy since he moved into the job. An Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from June found that just 34 percent approved his handling of the economy, barely up from 33 percent from the same pollster in May. A Gallup survey from April found that 64 percent of Americans had little or almost no confidence in Biden on economic issues.

Biden is trying to change that narrative. In a speech in Chicago last month, Biden introduced his economic messaging, one that focuses on the middle class, infrastructure investments and job creation. “Bidenomics is about the future,” he said. “Bidenomics is just another way of saying ‘restore the American Dream because it worked before.’”

But that message may be hard to sell, because arguably those economic shifts haven’t led to dramatic improvements in most Americans’ day-to-day lives.

While the U.S. bounced back quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdowns, that recovery was also marked by record-high inflation and nearly a year of historic interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. That’s left economists forecasting a recession like a dark cloud on the horizon. Some significant wage gains were made, especially for low-income workers, but those were on top of pre-COVID wages that were long considered by many economists and workers to be too low. And wage improvements were smaller for the middle class, which made them easier to ignore in the face of rising inflation. Add all of this together and it’s not hard to understand why even some Democrats are feeling kind of blah about the economy, and why they might not be too excited about Biden’s promises for the future.

Let’s get one thing out of the way — yes, some of the displeasure with Biden’s economic performance is influenced by partisanship. Republicans are the most likely to disapprove of his handling of the economy, and they really disapprove. In the AP poll, only 10 percent ranked him positively on that score. But the surveys are picking up more than just partisan differences. Only 60 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners approved of his handling of the economy, and in many cases that approval is lukewarm. In a Navigator Research poll of registered voters, just over a quarter of Democrats strongly approved of Biden’s handling of the economic issues, while 46 percent somewhat approved. In a Morning Consult poll from April, Democrats graded Biden a B on the economy.

That pervasive middling feeling among many Democrats is a problem for a president who’s trying to convince the country that his economic policies can improve their lives. Biden has begun his campaign touting his focus on growing the middle class and creating jobs. But the reality is more complicated than that. While it’s technically true that the economy added millions of jobs under Biden’s watch, that’s at least partly a circumstance of when he took office. The pandemic and resulting economic shutdowns created a deep and sudden recession in the spring of 2020, when millions of Americans lost their jobs in the span of a few weeks, but the recovery began under former President Donald Trump, and Biden came in during the upward swing. And much of the job growth has been in industries disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, which means a lot of the jobs that are being “created” under Biden are making up for the early pandemic losses.

And it’s not clear that the job market will continue to boom — or that people are all that happy with it. In June, unemployment remained low but job growth slowed somewhat, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A slim majority of workers are extremely or very satisfied with their jobs overall, according to a Pew Research Center survey from March, but only 34 percent say they’re satisfied with how much they’re paid. Quit rates have also declined since last spring, meaning fewer workers are confident they could find a new and better job if they left their current one.

Meanwhile, inflation remains high, at just over 4 percent. That’s a marked improvement from a year ago, when inflation reached a peak of 9.1 percent, a 41-year high. The Fed temporarily paused its rate hikes in response, but they might resume again later this summer. Inflation has been one of the highest-ranking voter concerns in polls since before the midterms, but a recent Echelon Insights poll from June offers more specifics about what concerns voters. When asked to rank their concerns from among a more detailed list of choices, 28 percent of Republicans named “cost of living” and 17 percent said “jobs and the economy.” Among Democrats, those figures were 20 and 11 percent, respectively. Cost of living includes everything from grocery store prices to rents, which are finally easing but have been historically high.

Much of what happens with inflation is beyond Biden’s control, and it’s not clear whether or when inflation will return to normal or what the new normal might be. Families are still paying more for goods and services than they were before the pandemic, and they may be locked into high rents or mortgage payments, which means they’ll continue to feel squeezed even as inflation goes down.

And while concern about rapid wage growth drove the Fed’s rate hikes, it’s not clear that higher wages are leading to markedly better living conditions for some Americans. Post-COVID-19 wages have been growing, but mostly from the bottom. Real wage growth for low-wage workers from 2019 to 2022 was 9 percent, according to an analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which means it’s grown faster than inflation. That was partly driven by a high quit rate: The tight labor market meant that employees could leave jobs that weren’t satisfying or well-paying enough for better jobs. That often meant leaving low-paying service sector jobs, like in restaurants, and service sector employers had to raise their wages to lure employees back.

But while that wage growth has been real, wages were starting from a low place. Inflation, meanwhile, has still meant that those workers are paying more for everyday goods and services than they were before, eating into the feeling that they’re making more. “Often, if you are more working class or struggling at the bottom, you are probably spending more than you’re earning, perhaps because you’re in debt, perhaps because you’re working with government assistance,” said Mike Konczal, a director of macroeconomic analysis at the Roosevelt Institute. “And those things are not adjusted for inflation.”

And some of the recent gains for low-wage work may be temporary. Elise Gould, a senior economist at the EPI, said that Biden-era policies were actually responsible for some of that wage growth among the lowest-earning workers. Pandemic-era programs like enhanced unemployment benefits and child tax credits gave low-income workers the cushion they needed to be able to look for new jobs with higher wages, she said. But much of that assistance is gone or is drying up, and the gains could disappear. “There’s nothing that we have right now, in terms of labor standards … that’s going to lock in the wage gains that we have,” she said.

For those in the middle class, wage growth hasn’t been as high. The EPI report found that real wage growth for lower-middle-wage workers was 3.9 percent, 2.4 percent for middle-wage workers and 1.8 percent for those in the upper middle class. The change was driven largely by those who found new jobs, though, which meant that those who stayed in the same jobs likely saw less benefit. And middle-class Americans have seen their wealth take a hit because of higher interest rates, according to a recent Bloomberg analysis.

For younger voters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, high rents and home prices and general cost-of-living squeeze is about to run into student loan repayment. For the past three years, student debt payments have been paused, but that reprieve will stop at the end of the summer, and a recent Supreme Court ruling guaranteed that the promise of reduced or completely forgiven monthly payments is gone, at least in the near term.

For voters affected by student loans, any economic plan probably has to address relief because it’s integral to those other economic worries. “University and college used to be a guarantee to getting a job,” said Rahhel Haile, a founder of the Minnesota Youth Collective, which advocates for student loan relief and other issues important to younger voters. “And now it’s not as much of a guarantee as it used to be in previous generations.” What Biden does next on student loans, and the costs of college more generally, will determine whether young voters think he has their interests in mind, she said. “I think they need to see more effort … I think he needs to advocate more for young people,” she said.

In the same Echelon poll, respondents were allowed to choose a hypothetical third party that could get their votes. A plurality of Democrats said they wanted a party that would “Put the middle class first, pass universal health insurance, strengthen labor unions, and raise taxes on the wealthy.” Overall, this option was the most popular overall, with support from 31 percent of all respondents and 45 percent from Democrats. That’s the kind of agenda the Biden administration says it has, but he has yet to deliver on most of it. And asking voters to trust in the future is different than pointing to concrete results."

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above.

That 34% figure is even lower than his overall approval rating of 41%, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Biden’s approval figures have barely moved for the past year and a half, a source of concern for a president pursuing a second term on his ability to govern and focus on workers. He wants voters to connect local roads and bridge projects, factory construction and the rise of electric vehicles and renewable energy to the millions of dollars in initiatives he signed into law during the first two years of his administration.

“Bidenomics is about the future,” he declared in his Wednesday speech to cheering supporters. “Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American dream.”

At the same time, he sought to paint previous Republican tax cuts as deeply flawed, saying they helped the rich but failed the middle class for decades as the promised “trickle down” benefits never seemed to come to the less wealthy.

“The trickle down approach failed the middle class,” he said. “It failed America. It blew up the deficit. It increased inequity. And it weakened our infrastructure. It stripped the dignity, pride and hope out of communities, one after another.”

As he was departing Washington on Wednesday, Biden said he believes the U.S. will avoid the recession that many economic analysts have been expecting. Republican leaders such as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said last year that the high inflation under Biden’s watch meant that “we are in a recession,” but that is not the case under economic definitions.

GOP officials say their tax cuts have encouraged business investments and profits that have improved pay for workers and bolstered the stock market, while greater government spending would cause prices to keep rising and waste money.

Indeed, the economy has steadily improved over the past year of Biden’s term in the White House. Unemployment stands near a historic low at 3.7%. The inflation that has plagued Biden’s presidency has fallen to 4% from a peak of 9.1% last June. But prices are still rising significantly faster than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, a worry for voters and a line of attack for Republican lawmakers and other presidential candidates.

And smoke from Canadian wildfires, evident in Chicago on Wednesday, has added a new cloud for workers and shoppers in the U.S. The White House said it’s monitoring the air quality in Chicago but would not cancel the president’s scheduled events, which included a campaign reception in addition to the speech on the economy.

The new poll identifies a weakness within Biden’s own base. Many of the Democrats he needs to marshal in 2024 are comparatively unenthusiastic about his economic record. Seventy-two percent within his party say they approve of his handling of his job overall, but just 60% say they approve of his handling of the economy.

By comparison, during the depths of the pandemic as unemployment spiked, Republicans approved by overwhelming numbers of then-President Donald Trump’s economic leadership. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans now approve of Biden overall or on the economy, a testament to the polarization that defines modern U.S. politics.

Sarah Husted, 40, said she voted in 2020 for Biden, but “I wasn’t thrilled with either candidate.”

Living in Lincoln, Nebraska, Husted said that she feels as though inflation is getting worse, especially with regard to utilities and housing. But she largely believes the economic turmoil still reflects the disruptions caused by the pandemic.

“I don’t think that President Biden is helping the situation as much as he could, but I don’t think it’s all his fault,” she said.

That take was shared by other poll respondents interviewed by AP who voted for Biden in 2020. They generally saw him as a president grappling with partisan divisions, global competition and the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.

“He’s doing the best he can, but he can’t do anything without Congress,” said Alice Banner, 86, a retired nurse from Baltimore County, Maryland.

Ben Will, 34, noted the solid job growth during Biden’s presidency and said the infrastructure spending that Biden signed into law would help with growth.

“He’s doing a fantastic job with the cards that were dealt to him,” said Will, a marketing and advertising director from Reading, Pennsylvania.

Overall, 30% of U.S. adults say they think the national economy is good, up slightly from the 25% who said that last month, when the president and congressional Republicans were in the midst of negotiations over raising the nation’s debt limit and a historic government default was a risk. No more than about a third have called the economy good since 2021.

The administration is making a data-driven argument in addition to Biden’s speech. The Treasury Department released an analysis showing that spending on factory-related construction has doubled since 2021 after adjusting for inflation. White House economists issued a report that shows inflation is lower in the U.S. than the rest of industrialized nations in the Group of Seven.

White House aides believe that Biden’s speech on Wednesday can generate greater awareness of his policies and increase Democratic voters’ appreciation of the economy. While the president’s allies acknowledge that many Americans still hold dim views of the economy, they note that the actual economic data was far worse last November, when Democrats mounted a stronger-than-expected showing in the midterm elections.

Biden aides say they are encouraged by data showing Americans’ views can be changed by a consistent message reinforced on multiple fronts, which is what the president and his Cabinet are setting out to do by touring the U.S. over the next three weeks. Their hope is that repetition of Biden’s accomplishments, coupled with a contrast to GOP proposals to undo those initiatives, will stick with voters for 2024.

The poll of 1,220 adults was conducted June 22-26 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.

356,5 pillars of Biden's economic policy and how effective they've been - The Washington Post - The Washington Post,5 pillars of Biden's economic policy and how effective they've been - The Washington Post  The Washington Post,"Sat, 12 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzA4LzEyL2JpZGVuLWVjb25vbWljLXBsYW4tcGlsbGFycy1pbXBhY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"President Biden has defined “Bidenomics” as encompassing almost everything good in the U.S. economy — falling unemployment, robust wage growth, new small business creation. And he’s planning to make the concept central to his bid for a second term. “Bidenomics is just another way of saying, ‘Restore the American Dream,’” the president said in a recent address.

Republicans have defined the term in the almost the exact opposite way. Former president Donald Trump has called Bidenomics “total economic surrender to China and other foreign countries.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) calls it “blind faith in government spending and regulations.”

Beyond the partisan talking points, how has “Bidenomics” changed the U.S. economy?

Since taking office, the president has pushed through dozens of changes and personnel appointments that have upended everything from how workers unionize to how large corporations merge. Biden and his aides have sought to revive domestic manufacturing through a clean energy boom, while also trying — with mixed success — to expand the federal safety net.

Biden’s advisers say the president wants an attempt to move beyond the “trickle-down economics” that defined the last four decades in Washington. Biden frequently says past administrations focused on tax breaks for rich people and corporations, but that he aims instead for “growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out.”

The underlying idea is that new government investment “crowds in” additional investments from private companies, a break from past belief that constraining the public sector would free the private sector to grow more. The result is a federal government that intervenes directly much more than it’s done in decades — to boost unions, block corporate monopolies, and spur economic and industrial growth, among other goals.

“The idea of trickle-down [economics] is if the public sector stops investing — if it just disinvests in our public infrastructure — the private sector will come in and make up the difference,” Jared Bernstein, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Washington Post Live last month. “Joe Biden knows that’s always been wrong, and that, in fact, it’s backward.”

Republicans see “Bidenomics” not as a coherent doctrine, but a collection of sometimes contradictory policies designed to please various interest groups in the Democratic coalition. Critics in both parties have blamed Biden’s attempts to spur growth for exacerbating the highest inflation rates in four decades, and courts have repeatedly blocked his attempts to increase competition among corporate giants. Even to his allies, the execution of Biden’s overarching vision has been, at times, uneven and incomplete.

“Bidenomics is much less a coherent approach to economic policy and much more a grab bag of subsidies designed to advance key interests of the Democratic Party coalition,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank.

Here are five key parts of Bidenomics — and how they’ve fared over the president’s first two years in office.

Run the economy hot Return to menu Biden’s first major economic act was to sign the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion stimulus aimed at pushing past the recession caused by the pandemic. Determined to avoid the sluggish growth that characterized the recovery from the Great Recession under President Barack Obama, Biden argued that “the biggest risk is not going too big … it’s if we go too small.” Advertisement The result, in part, was the fastest-growing economy in decades. The nation’s gross domestic product surged by roughly 6 percent — a level not seen since the 1980s — as the unemployment rate plummeted and the number of new small businesses soared. The president is fond of emphasizing that the United States has had the fastest recovery among the Group of Seven industrialized Western economies, which he and many economists attribute to the rescue plan. And growth has powered on for two years, including 2023 so far. In hopeful moment, storm clouds over Biden economy appear to lift But economists are still debating how the rescue plan contributed to inflation. Price increases have proven perhaps Biden’s central political liability, even though Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and supply chain snarls — two factors largely beyond the president’s control — exacerbated the crisis. And although inflation has eased recently, voters still rank it as a top concern.

Revive domestic manufacturing through green energy Return to menu Biden has signed three sweeping economic laws aimed in part at reviving U.S. manufacturing — one to bolster the domestic semiconductor industry, another to repair the nation’s crumbling infrastructure and a third to spur the clean energy industry. These bills have other key goals — the Inflation Reduction Act took aim at climate change, for instance, and the infrastructure law was primarily intended to improve decaying public works. But the laws are linked by the belief that the United States should bring back supply chains sent across the world over decades of globalization, through a mixture of new tax incentives, trade restrictions and domestic subsidies. Small-town GOP officials are torn over Biden’s clean energy cash The White House has touted early signs that these efforts are working, even before most of the money has been spent. The Treasury Department has found spending on manufacturing plants has exploded, with a particular boom in electronics and computers. Taking advantage of the generous new credits, clean energy firms are rushing to construct new plants and facilities, spreading billions in new investment across the country. Advertisement But challenges have emerged. The United Auto Workers have expressed frustration that the administration has awarded loans to EV battery manufacturers without mandating any wage or benefit protections, reflecting broader fears that the clean energy revolution may hurt organized labor. (Administration aides may have little choice in that matter, as they are implementing a law they barely managed to pass through Congress.) And the United States has enormous ground to make up: The number of manufacturing workers has risen about to its pre-pandemic high, but it remains far below what it was for much of the 20th century.

Rein in corporate power Return to menu Another core plank of “Bidenomics” has been to try to mute the power of large corporations, particularly by breaking up monopolies and cracking down on “junk fees.” Advertisement Met by opposition in Congress, Biden’s antitrust agenda has largely fallen to Lina Khan, who the president selected to lead the Federal Trade Commission. Khan has transformed the agency, pushing it to be far more aggressive in blocking large corporate mergers, and the Department of Justice has stepped up similar efforts. Business executives speak of a “chilling effect”: The number of monthly merger notifications fell by roughly 40 percent from 2021 to 2022, according to government data compiled by White & Case. Still, Khan has suffered some setbacks in the courts, recently losing a case over Microsoft’s takeover of Activision Blizzard. Noncompete clauses are everywhere, even for dancers and hair stylists Biden has also taken aim at “junk fees” — hidden costs from companies that make services appear cheaper than they are. The administration has moved to eliminate credit card late fees, require airlines to disclose full prices for tickets and force cable providers to list service prices. And the administration is also pushing new rules to ban corporations from requiring workers to sign overly broad agreements not to work for competitors."

Will they sour on Biden?

Ashley Robinson has been paying her student loans for over a decade, consistently unable to chip away at $50,000 in debt because interest replaces the payments she makes. President Joe Biden's debt relief efforts last fall offered a moment of elation and then, quickly, deep disappointment.

""In terms of a massive, broken promise? Yeah, I think that definitely negatively impacts how I feel toward him,"" said Robinson, 33, a D.C.-based independent consultant.

Biden announced a plan to relieve the debts of 43 million Americans last year, allowing between $10,000 and $20,000 in cancellation to people who made below a certain income.

The attempt -- a campaign promise from the president -- was overturned by the Supreme Court this past summer, leaving the administration with far narrower pathways to pursue for student debt reform.

For many young voters, disappointment over student loan relief bleeds into the gloomy sentiment of the economy at large, the top election issue in the latest ABC News/Ipsos polling from November and one that threatens Biden's enthusiasm among a key voting bloc: the youth.

Seven in 10 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 believe that the economy is either ""very bad"" or ""fairly bad,"" according to a poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School in October and November.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Like their older counterparts, young people have faced rapidly increasing prices for everyday essentials and higher rates for borrowing on credit cards or mortgages over the past year. But they're more likely to have weathered such financial challenges alongside student debt.

Because of the strong trend of young people voting for Democrats, their displeasure may not prove a decisive factor in the election next year -- but for voters like Robinson, she says it contributes to a sense of apathy all the same.

""I'm not enthusiastic about voting, but voting is something that's important to me. So I continue to participate,"" she said.

Recognizing that Biden faced few ways to achieve debt relief without relying on executive power given the split majority in Congress, and that even those efforts were shut down by a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Robinson said she knows it's not ""going to be a cakewalk for anyone.""

Still, it feeds into her broader sentiment about Biden and his administration: That it's ""just simply not as progressive as I've needed it to be.""

""I genuinely believe that this is Biden's best, but I don't believe that Biden's best is sufficient,"" she said, adding that she wished he had been more proactive and aggressive in delivering relief.

Turnout has been high among young voters in the last two election cycles, though -- and Robinson says she'll be one of them come 2024.

Abby Kiesa, the Deputy Director of CIRCLE, an independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement at Tufts University, says that's because young voters are driven by a combination of issues.

""I don't necessarily think the lack of cancellation of all student loan debt tanks Biden's ability to really talk with young voters,"" Kiesa said.

About 12% of youth put student loan debt into their top three issues, while Black voters are twice as likely to list it in their top three, Kiesa said, citing a recent CIRCLE survey from November.

With 11 months to go, Kiesa said the impact of Biden's failed student debt relief policy could be determined by how much he's able to communicate what else his administration has done.

Over 3.6 million people have received some form of debt relief under Biden for a total of $132 billion. The Education Department has also rolled out a new payment plan, the SAVE Plan, that it calls the most affordable option for the majority of borrowers.

And the administration is working on a narrower debt relief policy, likely to be unveiled before the 2024 election, that will aim to target borrowers who have been the hardest hit by loans. But it, too, could face legal challenges.

The large majority of people who have received debt relief are those who were in faulty programs, either income-driven repayment plans or the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Both programs have been plagued with systemic failures that didn't allow people to receive the debt relief that was promised to them once they hit a certain number of years in repayment.

Over 900,000 people have gotten debt relief through fixes to the income-driven repayment system, and almost 750,000 people have gotten relief through fixes to the PSLF program.

One young person with student debt who spoke to ABC News, Liam Gude, hasn't been the recipient of any of that relief and even thought Biden's initial policy was too skimpy.

After landing a job this fall as an environmental planner, Gude said he vaulted from years of low-paid work into the middle class, giving him every reason to be optimistic about the nation's robust job market and wider economy.

Instead, Gude feels downbeat, blaming President Biden for a failure to achieve major student debt cancellation that has left Gude saddled with $98,000 in loans.

""Biden has taken the most milquetoast position that he could,"" Gude, 30, said of an executive order that would have canceled up to $20,000 in debt per borrower but was struck down by the Supreme Court in June.

""That would have been a drop in the bucket,"" said Gude, a self-identified progressive who lives in Western Massachusetts. ""It's laughable – it's an insult.""

Gude takes issue with other economic policies, such as a series of interest rates at the Federal Reserve that, in theory, threaten to drive up unemployment in an effort to fight inflation. Biden's handling of the Israel-Gaza war have also disappointed Gude, he said

Still, he acknowledged, ""Biden is way better than Trump."" But that doesn't necessarily mean Gude will vote for Biden, he said, noting he wants to see more progressive proposals, including an ambitious effort to cancel student debt.

Some young people with student debt said they plan to vote for Biden despite his failure to secure ambitious debt cancellation.

Michael Stewart, a student loan borrower, said he was more excited about Biden during the 2020 campaign due in part to his promise to address education-related debt. But, Stewart added, some of that enthusiasm also stemmed from a distaste for Biden's opponent.

""I definitely was more excited for him four years ago but that's because of the alternative,"" Stewart told ABC News.

After casting a vote for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 primary, Stewart threw his support behind Biden – and he intends to do the same next year. While Biden failed to achieve his campaign promise on student debt relief, he made a legitimate effort, Stewart added.

""I really fault him 0%,"" Stewart said. ""He did all he could."""

With the presidential election just over one year away, the Biden Administration faces a challenge: how to convince skeptical voters that the economy is in much better shape than they think.

As his aides search for a message that could break through to voters, President Joe Biden has been on a tour across the U.S. to tout his economic record and discuss the ways his policies are helping the middle class, making what he calls “Bidenomics” a key pillar of his reelection pitch. But Biden seems aware of the risks of tying himself to an economic climate that still makes voters wary: “I’m not here to declare victory on the economy,” Biden said on Thursday at a South Carolina manufacturing facility. “I’m here to say we have a plan that’s turning things around quickly, but we have a lot more work to do.”

The President’s stop in South Carolina, a deep-red state that he lost by more than 10 points in the last presidential election, comes amid an Administration-wide effort to build up public awareness of Biden’s legislative victories as he runs for reelection in 2024. Polling shows voters remain discontented with the economy as inflation holds steady, despite record job creation numbers and an unemployment rate hovering near 50-year lows. Biden’s approval rating was just below 42% in late June, according to a FiveThirtyEight polling average.

In the past, Biden has blamed his low approval rating on the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, both of which led to high gasoline prices, rising food costs, and increases in other cost-of-living expenses as inflation hit a 40-year high last summer. But as inflation cools, the Biden Administration is now eager to take full political ownership of the U.S. economy.

“I think it’s the most important issue to the race,” says Bryan DeAngelis, a longtime Democratic strategist who was involved in the 2009 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform. “The economy is always number one in voters’ minds. So barring something unforeseen happening in the future, I expect this will still be issue number one on the campaign trail and then on Election Day.”

Two senior White House officials, requesting to speak on background, told reporters on Thursday that the President is feeling good about his economic strategy as unemployment has now stayed below 4% for the longest stretch of consecutive months since the 1960s. “People are starting to feel the results of this,” one of the officials said. “We need to tell the story.”

Part of the strategy is to sell Americans on “Bidenomics,” a term White House aides have described as a broad collection of policies aimed at reviving and reshaping the economy to help the middle class. The Biden Administration has pointed to a range of efforts, including bolstering manufacturing investments, expanding high-speed internet access, and cracking down on industries that charge so-called junk fees.

But while Biden’s team hopes crafting a coherent message around the economy will win over voters, strategists on both sides of the aisle warn it could represent one the President’s biggest vulnerabilities in the race. Mike Lux, a long-time Democratic strategist who has worked as a senior staffer or advisor on six different presidential campaigns, says economic issues are Republicans’ “strongest chance at hurting Biden.” Already, the Republican frontrunners—former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis—have doubled down on Biden’s economic record and vowed to make it a top campaign priority. “When I left office, we handed Joe Biden the fastest economic recovery ever recorded — all with no inflation,” Trump said at a campaign event in April. “He took that booming economy, and he promptly blew it to shreds.”

Robert Blizzard, a veteran GOP pollster, says that voters are still concerned that their family’s incomes are falling behind the cost of living, and fears of a possible recession continue to loom large on people’s spending. “I think one of the challenges that this President has in particular is anytime he opens his mouth on anything, he is running the risk of alienating more Americans,” he says. “This strategy has the risk of significant pushback.”

For much of Biden’s presidency, his team has tried to defend his economic achievements, including dedicating a significant portion of his State of the Union address in February to highlight his record on job growth and unemployment. As the presidential race begins to take shape, the Administration appears set on intensifying messaging efforts about its economic agenda. “I do think it will be easier now than it was a year ago when inflation was so high for Biden to sell his economic policies,” says Brad Bannon, a long-time Democratic strategist. “But they need to keep their pedal to the metal and make a consistent effort to talk about his achievements over the next year and a half.”

In South Carolina on Thursday, Biden declared that Republican-led states are gaining factory jobs because of economic measures he pushed through Congress despite stiff GOP opposition. He pointed to government investments in computer chips, batteries, and electric vehicles that will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. “I didn’t get much help from the other team, but that didn’t stop us from getting it done,” Biden said. “Every Republican member of Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Blizzard argues part of the challenge is that most Americans are yet to fully feel the impact of Biden’s signature economic laws, including the bipartisan infrastructure bill, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. “I don’t think anybody knows what the hell the CHIPS act is,” he says. “If I did a focus group with voters across the country on what the CHIPS act is, they would probably wonder if it’s Doritos or Lays.”

Still, Democratic strategists believe the real risk for Biden is avoiding the issue entirely because it’s unpopular. “The economy is on people’s minds,” Lux says. “You can’t avoid the topic. So we need to lean into the fight. We need to make our case. I don’t think we have any choice.”"

Biden touted ""good news today"" following the Labor Department's Friday announcement that a booming 336,000 jobs were added in September, the strongest monthly gain since January and eclipsing forecasts of 170,000 jobs added last month. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.8%.

""We have the highest share of working-age Americans in the workforce in 20 years,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House's Roosevelt Room. ""And it's no accident. It's Bidenomics.""

Yet polling shows Americans remain concerned about the economy primarily due to stubborn inflation, which although down significantly from a year ago, remains above pre-pandemic levels.

Nearly 70% of Americans said the economy is getting worse, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll last month, while only 22% said the economy is improving. Eighty-four percent of Americans said their cost of living is rising, and nearly half of Americans, 49%, blamed food and grocery prices as the main driver.

Biden, asked by a reporter why many Americans still don't feel good about the economy despite progress on jobs, pointed to negative media coverage.

""You all are not the happiest people in the world - what you report,"" Biden said. ""And I mean it sincerely. You get more legs when you're reporting something that's negative. I don't mean you're picking me. It's just the nature of things.""

He added: ""You turn on the television, and there's not a whole lot about boy saves dog because he swims in the lake. You know, it's about somebody pushed the dog in the lake. I mean, I get it.""

In addition to the robust September jobs numbers, job gains for July and August were revised up by a combined 119,000, pushing the advances for each month over 200,000 and painting a more robust picture of summer hiring than previously thought.

It's a sign that a recession once predicted might not materialize.

""I think the 300,000-plus people who got jobs feel better about the economy,"" Biden said. ""The American people are smart as hell and know what their interests are. I think they know they're better off financially than they were before. It's a fact.""

He has repeatedly claimed that he inherited an economic disaster. It was his policies, he alleges, which brought us back from the brink—and Biden is likely to repeat that narrative in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.

The only problem with Biden’s version of events is the facts.

For starters, Biden has frequently said that inflation was out of control when he became president, going so far as to say it was one of the reasons he ran for office. But inflation averaged less than 2 percent during the primary campaign and averaged closer to 1 percent during the general election campaign. When Biden took office, annual inflation was a mere 1.4 percent.

Fast forward a year and a half, and inflation was 1.3 percent—for a single month. Prices were rising about as fast in one month as they did in the entire year before Biden took office. The annual inflation rate broke 9 percent for the first time in four decades.

>>> America Is Hurtling Toward Financial Calamity. It’s Not Too Late To Change Course

The president’s retelling of events is also incongruous with his own previous statements on inflation. He used to say that inflation was merely transitory. Why, then, would he decide to run for president on a transitory issue? And why would he now take credit for reducing inflation if it was only transitory to begin with?

That reduction in inflation has been little consolation for the average American family, buckling under the weight of rising prices, particularly for necessities like food and shelter. While the rate of price increases has certainly slowed in recent months, as government deficit spending also slowed and the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, prices are still up about 14 percent under Biden. That is substantially more than the increase in average earnings.

Adjusting those earnings for inflation, called real earnings, shows that people can buy less today than when Biden took office. The average family has seen real annual earnings fall about $6,000 under Biden, while higher interest rates have increased borrowing costs another $1,400. That means a family effectively can buy $7,400 less today than it could in January 2021.

While real earnings have improved slightly over the last several months, they are still below their May 2022 level, and down 5.5 percent under Biden. Simultaneously, the monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home has risen 80 percent, or about $9,500 a year. The president is fond of saying his administration is providing families with ""breathing room,"" but it looks like that breathing room is underwater.

And Biden’s distortion of the facts continues with the labor market. He is quick to brag about a record number of jobs being added in his first two years of office, and he is technically correct about non-farm payrolls increasing dramatically, but this is cherry-picking in the extreme, not to mention taking the data out of context.

The economy lost 20.5 million jobs in March 2020, an unprecedented decline. But the recovery was also unprecedented, as businesses reopened, and lost jobs were restored. Recovering lost jobs is hardly the same as job ""creation"" however, a word that the president uses frequently.

Yet, even if Biden wants to play that game, he still doesn’t win. Using Biden’s own logic, President Trump added 12.5 million jobs in nine months, averaging 1.4 million jobs per month. Biden has added 12.1 million jobs in two years, averaging 500,000 jobs per month.

>>> When Government Policy Hits Home—And Your Wallet

Did Trump ""create"" more jobs in less time than Biden? According to Biden’s logic, yes. But the entire discussion of merely regaining lost jobs after the government-imposed shutdowns is meaningless.

When the initial lockdowns ended in late Spring 2020, many people immediately returned to work. Although Biden loves to tout manufacturing jobs numbers, he ignores the fact that 41 percent of those jobs lost in the initial outbreak of COVID were recouped by June 2020.

The recovery that began two years ago was unprecedentedly large because the decline before it was equally large. What Biden inherited was an economy growing at a $1.5 trillion annualized rate—hardly ""reeling,"" as he now describes it. And yet, the economy managed two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth a year and a half after Biden took office, with many economists forecasting negative growth to return this year.

These may be politically inconvenient facts, but they’re facts, nonetheless.

Before trying to misrepresent them in his State of the Union address, Biden should consider the words of Winston Churchill: ""United wishes and good will cannot overcome brute facts. Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may resent it. Ignorance may deride it. Malice may distort it. But there it is."""

He would also like you to associate those good feelings with him. Hence what the White House is calling “Bidenomics.”

The White House has spent much of the summer laying out its theory of the case on the economy in speeches, appearances, and memos, all looking ahead to Biden’s reelection bid in 2024. The president’s message is that Bidenomics is about growing the economy “from the middle out and bottom up” instead of the top down. It’s framed in opposition to the Reagan-era trickle-down economics, which held that cutting taxes and regulations for corporations and the wealthy would spur prosperity that eventually works its way down to everyone. (It’s an approach that’s left lots of people waiting on that trickle.) Bidenomics — a name the administration has adopted, not invented — is also a departure from standard Democratic fare, at least somewhat. On the whole, it’s greater in magnitude and has more of a supply-side bent to it, being more focused on increasing the amount of stuff than on redistributing stuff, than prior Democratic regimes.

Beyond its exact contours, Bidenomics is an attempt by the president to package his approach to the economy, much of which is quite complex, in a way that — he hopes — voters can appreciate and understand. But more than a specific set of economic principles, Bidenomics seeks to create a narrative around the economy and tell a story about what’s happening in order to counter the vague sense of negativity felt by many Americans. In economics and politics, perception can be as important as reality, and Biden is trying to shape that perception.

“Being able to tell a story about the economy is important,” said Angela Hanks, chief of programs at Demos, a progressive think tank, and a former official at the Department of Labor. “It doesn’t have to be a book about the economy, but it has to be a story that people can understand and hold in their heads and connect to things that are happening in their real lives.”

Just how receptive the American public will be to Biden’s economic appeal is an open question. The way people feel about the economy is notoriously partisan — Republicans say everything’s awful when a Democrat is in the White House, and vice versa. While consumers overall are starting to feel better about the economy, they’re still bothered by high inflation, and it’s not clear that the economy’s vibes are all that great, whatever the data says. Whether tying himself to the economy will be a win for Biden is unclear, but he may not have a choice either way.

What even is Bidenomics?

Bidenomics is a made-up way to package some very real things. Legislatively, it entails items such as the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and the CHIPS Act. On the regulatory front, it tries to boost competition in ways big, such as antitrust enforcement, and small, like eliminating junk fees. From the bully pulpit, it is a bent that is more pro-worker and focused on specific industries.

“Being able to tell a story about the economy is important”

The way the White House lays it out, at the core of Bidenomics are three pillars: making smart public investments in America, empowering and educating workers, and promoting competition. Within those pillars, Bidenomics takes big swings at change but also tackles issues at the margins, and some of it appears to be working.

“It’s a very sweeping economic agenda,” said Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. “Remember, there are a lot of ways to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, everything from setting up a factory that wasn’t there before, frankly, standing up an industry that wasn’t there before, to making your experience at StubHub and or renting an apartment more hassle-free and less expensive. It’s very micro, and it’s very macro.”

It’s not entirely clear if Bidenomics started as a Big Theory of the Economy and What to Do About It or a term the White House has come to embrace sort of after the fact. The president has acknowledged it wasn’t exactly his term of choice — a little bit like Obamacare for the Affordable Care Act, it’s a potentially pejorative-ish moniker that the president’s team has chosen to embrace and try to spin.

“I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics to what everyone in the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times began to call ‘Bidenomics,’” the president said in a June 18 speech in Chicago. “I didn’t come up with the name.”

Biden joked he doesn’t “know what the hell [Bidenomics] is” at a separate event earlier in the month, “but it’s working,” he said.

“A sum of Bidenomics seems to be, like, taking credit for the general suite of macro data,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economic adviser to the Obama administration. “Outcomes are part luck, part presidential policy, partly he didn’t get half the things he wanted done.”

The economy is moving in a favorable direction. Inflation is cooling, though it’s still higher than where policymakers would like for it to be. The job market is strong, as is economic growth. The US continues to avoid a recession, and the scenario where the economy sees a soft landing — meaning it cools without dipping into negative territory — appears to be increasingly likely.

What the White House is doing is trying to showcase it, whether that be highlighting the super-fast repair of a collapsed bridge in Philadelphia or celebrating the groundbreaking on a new Intel plant in Ohio or touting the $40 billion states are getting to roll out more broadband infrastructure. The intended appeal here is supposed to be that these investments and activities will make a difference now and also for years down the line.

“It is a long-term investment in capacity. Some people call it industrial strategy; others call it industrial policy. I sometimes like to call it investment policy or supply-side policy, but what it is is this attempt to stimulate specific capacities in the economy,” said Yakov Feygin, who heads the Future of Capitalism program at the Berggruen Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. “It was a long-term investment into the supply side, not into recovering the economy overnight from a big recessionary shock.”

Bidenomics is different-ish than what you’d see from other Democratic administrations

I asked pretty much everyone I spoke to for this story whether they felt Bidenomics was really that different from run-of-the-mill Democratic politics and policy; whether it’s a break from, say, what the Obama and Clinton administrations would have done. The response, by and large, was that it isn’t some out-of-left-field philosophical shift but that it is distinct.

Joelle Gamble, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, said she sees Bidenomics as an “evolution” of Democratic policies past. “Congressional Democrats and Democratic presidents have been fighting for middle-class Americans against trickle-down economics for decades, and now that fight is front and center for Biden,” she said. “Investing in manufacturing, investing in hollowed-out communities, really empowering workers, promoting competition.”

One thing that sets Biden’s economic approach apart is the magnitude of it

“I think it’s sort of 85 percent pretty standard fare for Democrats — higher taxes on the rich and corporations, more spending on infrastructure and people, more active government regulation trying to achieve a broader set of goals,” Furman said.

One thing that sets Biden’s economic approach apart is the magnitude of it. To put it simply, under the Biden administration, a ton of money is being dumped into the economy, and spending is being approved and encouraged to the tune of trillions of dollars. “If you combine the magnitudes of the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, and the Infrastructure Act, you have a transformational set of policies,” Bernstein said. Private spending has shot up in turn.

A hot economy is good for workers — businesses having to compete for labor means people can be pickier about the jobs they take, get better positions, and boost their pay. Wages have risen significantly for lower-wage workers and, more recently, wage gains have begun to outpace inflation for workers overall.

The White House says there’s more to Bidenomics’ benefit to workers than a strong labor market. They say that Biden is exceptionally pro-union and that the president really aims to be on workers’ side. “Markets don’t always deliver the most optimal outcomes, especially when it comes to labor markets, when there’s a lot of power for firms in the labor market,” Gamble said. “You need a counterbalance.”

Bidenomics is articulating an approach for progressive supply-side economics, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has made the case for in the past. Running in contrast with the Reaganomics view of supply-side economics, meaning tax cuts and deregulation to incentivize growth, this modern progressive view seeks to increase labor supply and invest in infrastructure. It also entails the federal government putting its thumb on the scale in favor of issues such as climate and technology.

“This is the left’s supply-side argument,” Hanks said. “What does it look like to have a supply-side policy where you invest in building things and doing things and pay attention to whether you’re creating the conditions for people who have been left out to get a job? It feels, frankly, like something that in the past folks have been hesitant to try.”

To be sure, Bidenomics entails big spending on the demand side as well, specifically with the American Rescue Plan, which was passed when he came into office and meant to help the country rebuild from the pandemic. It included measures such as stimulus checks, plussed-up unemployment insurance, and an expanded child tax credit. The spending and stimulus done under the Trump administration in response to the pandemic bleeds into that, too.

“Any evaluation of Bidenomics has to recognize the scale of fiscal spending that was undertaken in response to the pandemic,” said Alex Williams, senior economist at the advocacy group Employ America. “Part of the growth resilience right now is almost certainly still from actually responding to a recession with large-scale fiscal spending and transfers.”

Some economists note that some of Bidenomics does look a little Trumpy, not only in the pandemic-related spending but also in its made-in-America bent. Europe has complained that the Inflation Reduction Act is protectionist and overly focused on boosting industries within the US. Biden has kept some of Trump’s tariffs in place. The administration has made no secret of its desire to lift up manufacturing and promote industries and jobs at home.

Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank, ticked off the list of what he sees as overlap between Biden and Trump: “Lots of protectionism, spending a bunch of money to try and boost manufacturing, an embrace of industrial policy, economic nationalism.”

“[Biden] is the first president other than Trump that is pretty protectionist in their approach and has expanded ‘Buy American’ a lot,” Furman said.

Bernstein said that Biden’s approach shouldn’t be characterized as protectionist but instead is a “very intentional thrust to improve domestic production in key areas” such as electric vehicles, battery production, solar panels, and microchips. He noted that domestic production involves foreign direct investment, and that part of the Biden administration’s approach to trade is broader than perhaps under a different regime.

“For a long time, trade was viewed through a prism of will it help consumers? Full stop,” Bernstein said. “We also think that workers must be in the equation. Trade policy must reflect not only consumer welfare but worker welfare and community welfare, and hollowing out communities in the interest of consumer-oriented trade with no regard for workers, that doesn’t fit into Bidenomics.”

Biden needs a story he can tell on the economy that the American public will buy into

Polling shows that voters tend to trust Republicans over Democrats on the economy, even though historically the economy has generally done better under Democratic leadership. There’s no single reason that’s the case, but it is true that Republicans tend to have a straightforward message on the economy — slash taxes, cut the red tape — that’s easy to distill and understand. Democrats don’t really have that.

“I think for a long time Democrats have lacked a real coherent analysis of what their economic plans will do,” Hanks said.

Bidenomics is, in part, a way to try to change that. It takes a lot of actions and tactics that are, admittedly, quite complex on the part of the Biden administration and Democrats, and tries to package them. Semiconductors are important, as they power everything from cars to computers to washing machines. They are also not a thing any regular person wants to have to think about in their daily lives.

“What I think you’re looking at is an attempt to articulate what all of these things add up to and a clearer overarching vision,” Hanks said. “It is built out of these things that are already happening, and we have to be able to say it in a way that makes sense to people — the why behind it and why it makes sense to achieve.”

“Biden came into a genuinely very complex economic situation and has performed genuinely very admirably”

Williams, from Employ America, echoed the point. “Biden came into a genuinely very complex economic situation and has performed genuinely very admirably, but because of the complexity of the situation, it’s difficult to adequately communicate in terms of the simple parables that people are used to using to explain the economy,” Williams said.

The Bidenomics strategy is a tricky one. The economy is, by many measures, in good shape. The investments the country is making in a variety of areas, from climate to broadband, could in the long term do a lot of good. The pandemic was a stark reminder of just how fragile America’s supply chains are and why they need shoring up. Many consumers appreciate being able to sit next to their kids on a flight or finally get hearing aids over the counter, both of which were Biden initiatives on the competition front.

At the same time, many people don’t necessarily associate these positive developments with Biden, nor do they feel very positive about the economy or him overall. Polls show that voters remain quite negative on the economy and on the president’s handling of it. Whatever the aggregate data says, you can’t tell people their perceptions and personal experiences are wrong.

That makes the goal of Bidenomics a sort of two-pronged one: to get Americans to see all of the good that there is in the economy right now, and to tie it back to the White House.

“Why we need to articulate a vision like Bidenomics is because we need to connect the outcomes that people think are good and don’t necessarily attribute to government with the actions the government’s taken,” Gamble said. “And this is a perennial challenge.”

There’s no solid, one-sentence answer on what exactly Bidenomics is, and to a certain extent, it doesn’t really matter. What will ultimately matter are the results, what this approach looks like five, 10, 20 years down the line, and what doing things a little bit bigger and a little bit more intentionally, accomplishes."

(AP) — President Joe Biden said Tuesday that Republicans’ ideas for cutting the budget could undermine U.S. manufacturing and help China dominate the world economy.

Speaking at a semiconductor maker in North Carolina to highlight his own policies, Biden is trying to shape public sentiment as he faces off with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., about whether the federal government should raise its legal borrowing capacity.

McCarthy sent a letter Tuesday saying that talks should start about possible spending cuts in return for the debt limit increase. Biden has said Republicans need to put forth their own budget plan before negotiations start. Without an agreement, the federal government could default on its financial obligations.

The president tried to ratchet up pressure on Tuesday by saying that the GOP demands on the budget would only empower China, the country’s key geopolitical rival. Being tough on China has been a core part of the identity of former President Donald Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House in 2024, and his Make America Great Again movement. The Democratic president said their objections to his policies would instead strengthen China.

“It would mean ceding the future of innovation and technology to China,” Biden told the crowd. “I’ve got news for you and for MAGA Republicans in Congress: not on my watch. We’re not going to let them undo all the progress we made.”

Biden’s trip to Wolfspeed follows the Durham-based company announcing plans last September to build a $5 billion manufacturing facility in Chatham County that is expected to create 1,800 new jobs. Biden had won passage last July of a $280 billion legislative package known as the CHIPS Act, which was intended to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry and scientific research.

It’s nothing new for the Biden administration to highlight the CHIPS Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, the $1 trillion infrastructure legislation and a roughly $375 billion climate bill — major legislation that the Democratic administration steered into law before Democrats lost control of the House.

But now, just weeks after Biden unveiled his own budget — it includes $2.6 trillion in new spending — his administration is looking for chances to lean into its battle with Republicans over spending priorities and who has better ideas to steward the U.S. economy in the years to come. Republicans have rejected Biden’s budget but have yet to unveil their own counteroffer to the Democrats’ blueprint, which is built around tax increases on the wealthy and a vision statement of sorts for Biden’s yet-to-be-declared campaign for reelection in 2024.

His trip is part of a larger effort to draw attention to his policies, which have been overshadowed by high inflation.

Besides Biden’s visit to Wolfspeed, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and other senior administration officials will fan out to 20 states over the next three weeks to highlight the impact of Biden’s economic agenda, according to the White House.

Biden has said he intends to run for a second term but has yet to formally launch his reelection campaign.

His effort to highlight legislative victories could also give him an opportunity to present voters with images of an administration focused on governing as Trump braces for a possible indictment.

Trump is being investigated over payments during his 2016 campaign to two women who alleged affairs or sexual encounters with him. The ex-president denies being involved with either of the women — porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal.

Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020. Among the other states that Biden and administration officials will be visiting in the weeks ahead are Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin — crucial battlegrounds that Biden won in 2020 and states expected to be competitive again in 2024."

When voters were asked an economic right direction/wrong track question, the poll found 25 percent right direction to 61 percent who said the economy was on the wrong track.

The survey also asked voters whether they believed “the Biden administration has taken historic actions to lower costs for American families.” Biden was on the losing end, with 30 percent believing that statement and 59 percent not buying it.

Cutting to the chase, when asked if Biden’s economic plan was working, by a margin of 31 percent to 55 percent, people said they didn’t believe it was working. Even worse for the “Bidenomics” narrative, a significant majority of respondents said they don’t believe inflation is getting better: 22 percent better to 56 percent worse.

People simply don’t believe Biden’s claims about inflation, such as those he made in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed.

“Our work isn’t done, but as supply chains continue to unsnarl, company profit margins fall from historically high levels, and rents continue to moderate, inflation should decline even further, creating more breathing room for working families,” the president wrote.

Biden seems to have forgotten that corporate tax revenues played a key part in a 43 percent increase in federal revenues over the past two years. Because the year-over-year Consumer Price Index inflation rate that reached 9.1 percent last June has come down to 4 percent, the media narrative, as CNN put it, asserts that inflation is “coming back down to earth.”

But here again, the media and the Biden team are missing the point. A better reflection of just how well “Bidenomics” is performing is the Winston Group’s Presidential Inflation Rate (PIR), which measures a president’s handling of inflation from their inauguration month to the month of the most recent CPI report. It helps explain the disconnect between the Biden economic narrative and the American public.

Biden’s PIR is based on the January 2021 CPI when he took office and the May 2023 CPI report. The percent difference between these two important index points gives us the overall price increase since Biden took office, a better measure of his policies than the year-over-year inflation rate increase or decrease. We do the same analysis for Presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.

In April, Biden’s overall inflation rate had been 16 percent; in the May report, his inflation rate had increased to 16.3 percent, which means prices have gone up 16.3 percent since the beginning of his administration. Of the previous seven presidents, only Carter had a worse number.

For some additional context, in their first term, four presidents, Trump, Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton never had a 4 percent inflation rate or higher in any month. Collectively, that comes to 192 months without inflation at or over 4 percent.

In contrast, during his 29 months in office, Biden has had 26 months with inflation running hot — at over 4 percent, reaching a 40-year high of 9.1 percent last June. According to the PIR, looking at specific inflation categories, food prices are up 18.9 percent since the start of Biden’s term, a slight increase from last month. Gas prices have come down from their peak but are still at a staggeringly high 51.4 percent increase and electricity also remains high at 21.8 percent, a half-point decrease from last month.

Biden and company like to claim success on inflation; but compared to four recent former presidents, his inflation record is a clear weakness.

Cherry-picking

Last Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee, telling members interest rate hikes may be on pause but aren’t over. His prepared remarks indicated that there is an expectation “that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.”

The Fed Chair reiterated his commitment to achieving his 2 percent inflation target but acknowledged that reaching that level has “a long way to go.” The Congressional Budget Office’s 2027 projection to reach 2 percent supports the argument that the “Bidenomics” recovery may overtake the Obama-Biden historically slow recovery from the Great Recession.

Unfortunately, cherry-picking and manipulating data to serve Biden’s reelection efforts has become the hallmark of the administration’s communications strategy, with no better example than a memo from West Wing aides Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon, released this week in the lead-up to the Chicago speech.

The memo’s title, “‘Bidenomics’ Is Turning the Page on Failed Trickle-Down Policies and Transforming Our Economy — And It Is Strongly Supported by the Vast Majority of Americans” — couldn’t be more misleading.

When the Winning the Issues survey asked participants whether Biden’s economic policies were correct or incorrect, only 31 percent said they were correct while 52 percent believed they were incorrect.

They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I doubt that Reagan would care that the Biden campaign has reached back to the 1980s for their newly minted campaign narrative. What he wouldn’t support are the big government, big spending policies that haven’t done the job — and the American people know it.

“Reaganomics,” the supply side policies of the 40th president, was scoffed at by Democrats, liberal economists and the media at the time. But the Reagan recovery proved them wrong and put the country’s economy back on a fast track. Critics had little to say when Reagan once joked, “I could tell our economic program was working when they stopped calling it ‘Reaganomics.’”

“Bidenomics” should be so lucky.

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above.

The president toured the Philly Shipyard, where there was a steel-cutting ceremony for the Acadia, a vessel that will help to build offshore wind farms. Biden ticked through the various union jobs being created by the project, promoting a message he has started to amplify as he seeks a second term.

“A lot of my friends in organized labor know, when I think climate, I think jobs,” the president said. “Union workers are the best in the world.”

But tensions are rising between unions and companies about a rapidly evolving economy in which artificial intelligence, clean energy and e-commerce are rewriting some of the basic rules of work. Biden is trying to allay those concerns by saying unions should be a part of the way ahead. But the Democratic president also knows from past experience that a strike could harm his reelection chances.

Biden has long called on businesses to hire unionized workers, saying that the premium paid will lead to higher quality work. Companies, however, seem reluctant to meet unions’ terms in separate contract talks with script writers, actors, autoworkers and UPS employees.

Hollywood production is shut down as the Writers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild are striking, partially over concerns about streaming revenues as well as AI taking away jobs from creative workers. The strike has put TV shows and movies in limbo.

The United Auto Workers are starting contract talks, and members say they expect a possible strike. They want to ensure there are union protections at new battery plants for electric vehicles. The union contract expires before midnight on Sept. 14.

The Teamsters are threatening a strike by 340,000 UPS workers if a deal is not reached with the delivery company by July 31. As more Americans shop online, UPS drivers say they need air conditioning in more trucks and equal pay for weekend shifts. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien has asked Biden not to get in the middle of negotiations.

Biden administration officials say that unions are empowered to press for more benefits and better pay because of the strong job market. Unemployment is a low 3.6 percent, and job openings are relatively high. The White House says that Biden’s policies have created these conditions.

But a series of strikes could also sink the U.S. economy and Biden’s message to voters.

Last year, the administration hustled to forge a tentative agreement between rail companies and their unionized workers to avoid a strike that could have injured the economy before the midterm elections. The tentative deal prevented a strike, but it failed to appease workers, and Congress ultimately had to intervene by imposing an agreement.

When asked if an autoworkers or Teamsters strike could similarly threaten growth, administration officials declined to speculate and said only that the president believes in the right of collective bargaining for workers.

Biden spent part of this week focused on efforts to expand unionization into new industries. On Monday, he met with younger workers trying to unionize at Starbucks, minor league baseball, bus-maker Blue Bird and Sega. Labor Department data shows that workers under age 35 are much less likely to belong to a union than their older peers, meaning that the future of the union movement might depend on bringing in younger generations.

Unions also aided Biden’s election victory over President Donald Trump in 2020. Just 16 percent of voters in 2020 lived in a union household. But 56 percent of people in union households backed Biden for president against Trump, a Republican, according to AP VoteCast.

Union votes generally matter more in Northern states with an industrial legacy such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, key states for a Democrat seeking to win the electoral college. But there are few union votes in sunbelt states such as Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, where Biden hopes to compete in 2024 and where many of the investments in new computer chip and battery plants are being made.

Samantha Smith, strategic adviser for clean energy jobs at the AFL-CIO, said it’s important for the shift away from fossil fuels to not come at the expense of workers, arguing the goals of renewable energy and higher pay need to be complementary goals, not competing ones. Smith said unions have confidence that the manufacturing, infrastructure and energy investments under Biden will lead to more union jobs.

“First of all, we do have the most union-friendly president that anyone can remember — that’s why we endorsed him early,” Smith said. “We have a lot of confidence in this president and his ability to turn more than $1 trillion of investments — including in clean energy — into union jobs.”"

President Joe Biden's reelection pitch is taking shape around one word: Bidenomics.

The four-syllable label has become the White House's way of broadly gesturing to his economic platform, which -- as they are quick to tout -- includes targeted investments in U.S. industry, support for unions and more.

This summer, Biden and his surrogates have fanned out across the United States to advertise that record, particularly in swing states like Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Campaign advisers say it will continue to be a core part of Biden's messaging strategy.

""Since I took office, I've seen more than $3 billion in private investment in clean energy manufacturing, all across Wisconsin,"" he said in Milwaukee earlier this month. ""That's Bidenomics. That's investing in America.""

But Biden's ready embrace of the term also represents a significant political wager: that he will benefit electorally by hitching his political image to the state of the economy, an issue on which he has gotten low marks in past polling.

Republicans see opportunity in that sour mood.

""We need to send Joe Biden back to his basement and reverse American decline. And it starts with understanding we must reverse Bidenomics,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at Wednesday night's GOP presidential primary debate, drawing applause from the conservative audience.

Still, Biden and his advisers believe he's making a good bet.

""The president has a plan, and it has very concrete components: smart investments, infrastructure, manufacturing and giving people higher wages,"" a senior administration official told ABC News. ""Anybody saying that we should repeal this agenda … I think they're going to have a tough sell.""

A recent flurry of positive economic data seems to support that claim. Manufacturing is rising steeply, with the White House saying in June that nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since Biden took office. And at its meeting last month, the staff of the Federal Reserve said that a recession, which they had been predicting, was no longer expected to happen.

But Americans still report feeling pessimistic. Biden's approval ratings on the economy have consistently hovered at around 33% since the peak of the pandemic. That's lower than his overall approval rating, which stands in the low 40s, according to FiveThirtyEight.

Breaking through there will be paramount for Biden as he builds a campaign message around economics. The cause of that persistent pessimism remains something of a puzzle to both the administration and some economists alike. Various explanations say consumers' decreasing purchasing power, sheer partisan bias, negative media coverage, or skittishness from COVID-19-related economic disruptions are to blame.

But to Darren Grant, an economics professor at Sam Houston State University, there is no mystery to the pessimism. His recent work on the topic shows a simple explanation for Americans' economic view: inflation rose, and wages didn't keep up.

When Grant published his paper earlier this year, ""some were eager to claim the public had become unreasonable,"" he said. ""I found that the public's view of the economy is not fundamentally irrational.""

That decline in consumers' purchasing power, which Grant found could explain ""most"" of Americans' recent shift in attitude, has gradually reversed over the course of 2023, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Grant also found that the unemployment rate matters significantly less for people's economic attitudes than it has in the past. That might explain why Biden's trumpeting of low unemployment rates isn't making much of a dent in voters' assessment of the economy.

Like many economists, Grant isn't sure why historically high employment doesn't, on its own, seem to be having the heartening effect it once did. His best guess is that the job market is less flexible these days -- in other words, it will take more time for the benefits of a thriving job market to fatten people's wallets.

""If you've dug a hole, then you need to get out of it,"" Grant said. ""That could take a little while.""

Andrew Davis, a self-described liberal Republican who lives in Washington, D.C., characterized his current financial state as a ""crunch period,"" with particularly high costs at the grocery store and in his utility bills.

""I'm not gonna say the bottom's out, but I don't -- my money doesn't stretch,"" he said.

While Biden touts positive economic indicators, Republicans are presenting prospective voters with a different story about the economy. GOP presidential hopefuls have sneered at ""Bidenomics"" and made inflation -- which peaked last summer at around 9% and has since dropped back to 3% -- a near-constant talking point in their campaigns.

""Bidenomics in a nutshell is: You pay more for the necessities of life, your standard of living goes down, the government gets bigger and more powerful, and ultimately China will benefit,"" DeSantis, the No. 2 Republican hopeful, according to national polling, said in a recent interview on Fox News.

Republicans are also putting forward economic plans of their own. Last week, former President Donald Trump sketched out a plan to impose a 10% tariff on all foreign imports in an attempt to put what he terms a ""ring around"" the U.S. economy, which some experts have warned would destabilize global trade.

""When companies come in and they dump their products in the United States, they should pay, automatically, let's say a 10% tax,"" Trump said in an interview on Fox Business. ""I do like the 10% for everybody.""

Some onlookers -- including those in the White House -- believe those messaging fights are part of the puzzle. Data suggests that people sense a disconnect between their own personal finances and the state of the economy more broadly.

A majority of Americans say the economy is in bad shape, but at the same time say their own finances are good, a Quinnipiac poll released last week found.

""There's no question that there is a disconnect,"" said Mark Copelovitch, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

He agrees that some people have been hit particularly hard by economic stressors, ""but there are lots of people who are better off who also think they aren't doing well.""

Copelovitch's forthcoming research finds that some of the best predictor of people's views of the economy are their partisan identities and how much right-wing media they consume.

Democrats are about three times more likely than Republicans to say that the economy is ""good,"" according to an AP/NORC poll released last week. That's consistent with the general trend that, going back to the early 2000s, people feel better about the economy when their own party controls the White House, CBS News polling shows.

The White House shares the hunch that the pessimism has a lot to do with media coverage.

""There's an obvious mismatch between a year of hundreds, if not thousands, of headlines about a recession, and the fact that there just hasn't been a recession,"" the Biden administration official said. ""If you're seeing headlines like that, and you're hearing punditry like that nonstop for a year, it certainly gives you a bad sense of the overall economy, even if you yourself are doing OK."""

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above.

The unemployment rate rose to 3.6 percent, from a 53-year low of 3.4 percent, as more Americans began searching for work but not all of them found jobs.

Friday’s report from the government made clear that the nation’s job market remains fundamentally healthy, with many employers still eager to hire. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress this week that the Fed would likely ratchet up its rate hikes if signs continued to point to a robust economy and persistently high inflation. A strong job market typically leads businesses to raise pay and then pass their higher labor costs on to customers through higher prices.

February’s sizable job growth shows that so far, hiring is continuing to strengthen this year after having eased in late 2022. From October through December, the average monthly job gain was 284,000. That average has surged to 351,000 for the past three months.

Economists pointed to other data in Friday’s report that suggested that the job market, while still hot, may be better balancing employers’ need for workers and the supply of unemployed people. More people have been coming off the sidelines to seek work, a trend that makes it easier for businesses to fill the millions of jobs that remain open.

The proportion of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one has risen for three straight months to 62.5 percent, the highest level since COVID struck three years ago. Still, it remains below its pre-pandemic level of 63.3 percent.

With more potential hires to choose from, employers seem under less pressure now to dangle higher pay to attract or retain workers. Average wage growth slowed in February, rising just 0.2 percent, to $33.09, the smallest monthly increase in a year. Measured year over year, though, hourly pay is up 4.6 percent, well above the pre-pandemic trend. Even so, that’s down from average annual gains above 5 percent last year.

What the Fed may decide to do about interest rates when it meets later this month remains uncertain. The Fed’s decision will rest, in part, on its assessment of Friday’s jobs data and next week’s report on consumer inflation in February. Last month, the government’s report on January inflation had raised alarms by showing that consumer prices had reaccelerated on a month-to-month basis.

Ahead of the February jobs data, many economists had said they thought the Fed would announce a substantial half-point increase in its key short-term interest rate, rather than a quarter point hike as it did at its meeting in February. Friday’s more moderate hiring and wage figures, though, led some analysts to suggest that the central bank may not need to move so aggressively at this month’s meeting.

“There’s clear signs of cooling when you dig deeper into the numbers,” said Mike Skordeles, head of economics at Truist, a bank. “I think it makes the case for the Fed to say … we’ll still hike rates, but we’re not going to do” a half-point hike.

The Fed’s final determination, though, will rest heavily on Tuesday’s report on consumer prices.

“Everything now hinges on February’s CPI report,” said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.

When the Fed tightens credit, it typically leads to higher rates on mortgages, auto loans, credit card borrowing and many business loans. Its rate hikes can cool spending and inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession.

Even for workers who have received substantial pay raises, ongoing high inflation remains a burden. Consumer prices rose 6.4 percent in January compared with a year ago, driven up by the costs of food, clothing and rents, among other items.

Frustrated by wages that aren’t keeping up with inflation, Rodney Colbert, a cook at the Las Vegas convention center, joined a strike Thursday by the Culinary Workers union to demand better pay and benefits. Colbert said that his hourly pay was $4-$5 less than what cooks were paid at casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.

“I’ll average approximately 28 hours a week, and that’s not enough,” Colbert said. “Just in the past two years, my rent has gone up $400, so that’s a lot.”

Nationally, nearly all of last month’s hiring occurred in mostly lower-paid services industries, with a category that includes restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment adding 105,000 jobs, its second straight month of strong gains. Warmer-than-usual weather likely contributed to the increase. With the weather likely allowing more building projects to continue, construction companies added 24,000 jobs.

Retailers added about 50,000 jobs last month, health care providers 63,000. Local and state governments — some of them flush with cash from stimulus programs — added 46,000 jobs.

Much of that job growth reflects continuing demand from Americans who have been increasingly venturing out to shop, eat out, travel and attend entertainment events — activities that were largely restricted during the height of COVID.

“We’ve created more jobs in two years than any administration has created in the first four years,” President Joe Biden said Friday about the employment report. “It means our economic plan is working.”

Economists note, however, that the very strength of the job market is itself contributing to the high inflation that continues to pressure millions of households.

In February, in contrast to the solid hiring in the services sector, manufacturers cut 4,000 jobs. And a sector that includes technology and communications workers shed 25,000 jobs, its third straight month of losses. It is a sign that some of the announced layoffs in the economy’s tech sector are being captured in the government’s data.

Last month, the government reported a surprising burst of hiring for January — 517,000 added jobs — though that gain was revised down slightly to 504,000 in Friday’s report. The vigorous job growth for January was the first in a series of reports to point to an accelerating economy at the start of the year. Sales at retail stores and restaurants also jumped, and inflation, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, rose from December to January at the fastest pace in seven months.

The stronger data reversed a cautiously optimistic narrative that the economy was cooling modestly — just enough, perhaps, to tame inflation without triggering a deep recession. Now, the economic outlook is hazier.

Justina Gallegos, Deputy Director for Industrial Innovation, Office of Science and Technology Policy



In 2021 and 2022, President Biden signed into law his Investing in America agenda, a series of strategic public investments in industries critical for the long-run economic growth of the United States. This included the largest investment in reducing carbon emissions in American history. The clean energy investments in the agenda—primarily in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act—include incentives for manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, investments in demonstration projects, loans and loan guarantees for a variety of technologies, and production and investment tax credits for clean energy generation. This suite of public sector tools provides unprecedented investment certainty to the private sector, with several provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act extending over a decade.

The most recent available data indicate that the President’s agenda has supported robust investment in the construction of manufacturing facilities and strong performance in key targeted industries including solar and wind energy, grid energy storage, and electric vehicles.

This brief highlights progress-to-date towards deploying these clean energy technologies. It describes how the President’s Investing in America agenda is translating into tangible outcomes and progress towards the President’s climate goals, and it outlines how the deployment of clean energy technologies will lower greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy security, and spur economic growth.

Investment in the construction of clean energy manufacturing facilities is exceeding expectations

As explained in a recent issue brief, the Investing in America agenda is intended to catalyze strategic private sector investments, and initial signs indicate that private companies are already responding. Since January 2021, private companies have announced over half a trillion dollars in new investment, including nearly $360 billion in clean energy manufacturing, EVs and batteries, and power generation.

One of the first ways these private clean energy investments will be visible in the economic data is through the construction of manufacturing facilities. Indeed, since President Biden took office, inflation-adjusted spending on the construction of manufacturing facilities has nearly doubled. This increase has exceeded forecasters’ expectations, suggesting that the Investing in America agenda is catalyzing more private sector funding than initially expected (Figure 1).

This growth in the construction of manufacturing facilities is strong relative to growth in other forms of construction. For example, inflation-adjusted manufacturing construction spending increased by 27 percent in the first ten months of 2023. Meanwhile, other types of non-residential construction grew 7 percent over the same period (Figure 2).

The Investing in America agenda is driving clean energy deployment

Other data sources indicate that the public clean energy investments in the President’s Investing in America agenda will translate into unprecedented private sector clean energy deployment in the coming years. In many cases, the acceleration is much faster than forecasters had previously anticipated.

Clean energy deployment

A central goal of the Investing in America agenda is to increase the amount of energy generated from clean sources like solar and wind, which will lower energy costs, improve energy resilience, and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Near-term investments in manufacturing, coupled with incentives like tax credits, are intended to reduce the costs of deploying clean energy at scale.

There has already been notable progress towards expanding U.S. solar and wind manufacturing capacity. Since the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022, over 100 gigawatts of planned manufacturing capacity have been announced for solar module assembly—which would produce enough solar panels per year to power more than 10 percent of U.S. homes. These announcements represent 79 new facilities and/or expansions and more than $13 billion in investment.

As the manufacturing base expands, solar and wind deployment are projected to grow rapidly—considerably faster than projections before the Investing in America agenda was signed into law. According to the latest Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) forecast[1] from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States is on track to have 338 gigawatts of solar capacity in 2030—nearly twice the capacity forecasted in the beginning of 2021 (Figure 3).[2] Likewise, for wind energy capacity, the latest AEO forecast estimates that the United States will have 300 gigawatts of wind turbine capacity in 2030, a 43 percent increase from their 2021 projection (Figure 4). For context, this estimated capacity from solar and wind in 2030 would be roughly double the total existing renewable capacity on the grid at the end of 2022.

Grid-scale energy storage deployment

Energy storage is another essential component of a clean electricity grid. Battery storage—either via grid-scale battery systems or an aggregation of smaller batteries in a virtual power plant—enables companies to store excess electricity from wind and solar energy and put that energy back on the grid when it is needed the most, helping to reduce total energy costs.

To grow the amount of energy storage on the grid, incentives from the President’s Investing in America agenda are spurring historic private deployment of large-scale energy storage capacity. Thanks to cost declines in battery energy storage, in just one year, grid-connected battery energy storage is on track to more than double. It is expected to nearly double again in 2024 (Figure 5). The latest forecasts, following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, show a dramatic expansion in capacity for grid-scale battery storage, far outpacing previous estimates (Figure 6). As of August 2023, grid-storage battery capacity is ahead of even this 2023 estimate.

Electric vehicle sales

The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) can lower energy costs, improve air quality, cut emissions pollution, and reduce noise pollution. Throughout the United States, it is cheaper to charge a vehicle using electricity than to fill it with gasoline. The average EV in the United States produces fewer emissions than the average new gasoline-powered vehicle, even when accounting for the current electricity mix of the U.S. grid. The Inflation Reduction Act is projected to double the share of clean electricity generation by 2030, further lowering the total carbon footprint of current and future electric vehicles as the grid becomes cleaner.

To reap the benefits of this technological innovation, the Investing in America agenda includes a range of incentives designed to support the EV industry. This includes investments to support EVs and EV battery manufacturing, funding to build a national network of EV chargers, and consumer tax credits to lower the cost of purchasing an EV. Private sector companies have begun to respond to these incentives. Since the beginning of 2021, firms have announced over $150 billion in investments to manufacture EVs and EV batteries. New EV models are also offering consumers more options. Between 2021 and the second quarter of 2023, the number of EV models increased from 34 to 55, with 14 new EV models in the last year alone.

EV sales have risen rapidly during this period from roughly 20,000 sales per month in 2020 and 2019 to over 90,000 per month in 2023 (Figure 7). At the start of 2023, forecasters estimated that beginning in 2026, more than one million EVs would be sold each year, and by 2030, nearly 1.8 million EVs would be sold—more than five times the forecast in 2021 (Figure 8). Actual sales have surpassed these forecasts. More than one million EVs have already been sold in 2023—three years ahead of the projections made earlier this year and 18 years ahead of the projections made in the beginning of 2021.

Clean energy deployment builds a better economy for Americans

Manufacturing and deploying clean energy technologies enables the United States to move faster towards the Biden-Harris Administration’s climate goals. Meeting these goals means reducing the impacts of climate change by cutting emissions, improving energy security and reliability, and spurring equitable economic growth. Some of these investments are spread out over a decade, meaning many of the associated benefits will accrue over time. Forecasters’ estimates preview some of these benefits to come.

First, more rapid deployment means more rapid progress towards preventing and mitigating the impacts of climate change. According to the most recent U.S. government forecast, U.S. emissions could fall nearly twice as much by 2030 compared to before the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law were in place. To the extent that deployment is indeed faster than originally anticipated, these emissions projections would improve even more.

Second, deploying clean energy can improve U.S. energy security and reliability while lowering energy prices. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the share of electricity from clean sources in 2030 could grow to 80 percent—nearly twice the expected amount before the Inflation Reduction Act passed. Strong growth in domestic clean energy industries supports energy security, reliability, and supply chain resiliency while creating good jobs. Deploying more clean electricity sources will provide opportunities to increase energy system reliability and security by reducing overreliance on traditional fuel sources alone. Increased long-duration energy storage capacity can also reduce outages and improve energy reliability. Meanwhile, new technologies like virtual power plants and other distributed energy resources can improve overall grid reliability. Similarly, the transition to electric vehicles can reduce U.S. consumers’ exposure to macroeconomic shocks from oil price volatility.

Third, investments in clean energy can contribute to long-term broad-based economic growth. In the aggregate, strong investments in manufacturing construction are contributing to GDP growth (Figure 9). In the latest data, private manufacturing facility construction contributed 0.3 percentage points to the total 3.0 percent real four-quarter growth. This means manufacturing construction accounted for roughly 10 percent of all GDP growth over the year, the largest annual contribution to GDP growth since the U.S. government began collecting these data in 1959.

In the long-run, these investments in clean energy are likely to pay for themselves in terms of the benefits accrued. According to a recent analysis, a dollar of spending on clean energy generates roughly twice as much in output as a dollar in spending on fossil fuel energy. A more recent working paper estimates that the production tax credit in the IRA will boost U.S. GDP by lowering the cost of electricity, meaning it generates more benefits than it is expected to cost—without even counting the benefits from reduced carbon emissions and air pollution.

Conclusion

In order to meet the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious climate goals, the United States needs to deploy clean energy at an unprecedented scale. To lower emissions across sectors like power generation and transportation, there is a need for generational investments in not only clean power generation but also related technologies like grid-scale energy storage and electric vehicles.

President Biden’s Investing in America agenda responds to this need with carefully designed incentives to mobilize private sector investments, including in clean energy technologies. At the macroeconomic level, there is already strong evidence that private sector commitments are translating into tangible construction projects to build new manufacturing facilities.

In critical clean energy industries, the latest available data indicate that the Investing in America agenda is enabling the United States to outpace previous projections of the rate at which the country would move towards its clean energy goals. Current data suggest the United States is moving rapidly towards a clean energy economy, even faster than many forecasts—both forecasts prior to the enactment of the President’s agenda and, for some technologies, forecasts immediately after the enactment of the agenda—had anticipated.

Ultimately, these investments will improve the economic and social wellbeing of Americans. Greater manufacturing capacity and deployment of clean energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles translate into lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved energy security and reliability, lower costs, and stronger economic growth in the long run.

Together, these latest data show that the President’s Investing in America agenda is already generating benefits—economic and otherwise—to the American people. Looking ahead, the latest forecasts suggest these investments are mobilizing more activity than previously anticipated, putting the United States even closer towards its goals of addressing climate change, promoting energy security, and generating steady, stable economic growth.

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above.

Last month’s job growth marked an increase from July’s revised gain of 157,000 but still pointed to a moderating pace of hiring compared with the sizzling gains of last year and earlier this year. From June through August, the economy added 449,000 jobs, the lowest three-month total in three years. In addition, the government revised down the gains for June and July by a combined 110,000.

Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 3.8%, the highest level since February 2022 though still low by historical standards. But the rate rose for an encouraging reason: A sizable number of people — 736,000 — began looking for work last month, the most since January, and not all of them found jobs right away. Only people who are actively looking for a job are counted as unemployed.

Indeed, the proportion of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one rose in August to 62.8%, the highest level since February 2020, before COVID-19 slammed into the U.S. economy.

A decelerating job market could help shift the economy into a slower gear and reassure the Fed that inflation will continue to ease. The central bank’s streak of 11 interest rate hikes has helped slow inflation from a peak of 9.1% last year to 3.2% now. Given signs that inflation is slowing, many economists think the Fed may decide no further rate hikes are necessary.

Friday’s jobs report also showed that wage gains are easing, a trend that may help signal to the Fed that inflation pressures are cooling: Average hourly pay rose 0.2% from July to August, the smallest such gain in a year and a half. Measured year over year, wages last month were up 4.3% from August 2022, slightly below the 4.4% increase in both July and June."

Story Highlights 42% overall job approval rating, similar to last month’s 40%

47% approve of handling of Ukraine situation; 46% of race relations

Rating on economy up five percentage points since March, to 37%

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Joe Biden’s job approval rating is a relatively steady 42%, and his ratings are subpar on nine key issues currently affecting the U.S.

Americans’ approval of the president’s handling of the situation in Ukraine (47%) and race relations (46%) are slightly higher than his overall rating. Meanwhile, 44% of U.S. adults approve of Biden’s handling of education, and fewer than four in 10 approve of his job performance on the other six issues -- labor disputes, foreign affairs, relations with Russia, the economy, relations with China and immigration.

###Embeddable###

Gallup has periodically measured Biden’s handling of seven of the nine issues included in the latest Aug. 1-23 poll, with the exceptions of race relations and labor disputes. Education was last measured one year ago, while all of the other issues were previously asked about earlier this year in February or March.

Biden’s rating on the economy has risen by five percentage points since March, as the U.S. economy has shown signs of improvement in recent months. Still, his rating remains weak, at 37% -- and is well below the 54% economic approval recorded shortly after his inauguration in 2021.

###Embeddable###

Although improved, Biden’s rating on the economy trails his overall job approval rating, which has averaged 41% over the past year.

Partisans’ Overall Job, Issue Ratings of Biden Sharply Polarized

Democrats’ approval rating of Biden’s job as president remains high, at 87%, compared with 39% among independents and 3% among Republicans. Democrats’ rating of Biden has ranged between 78% and 87% since December 2021.

###Embeddable###

More than eight in 10 Democrats approve of Biden’s handling of race relations, the situation in Ukraine and education, while their ratings of his job on relations with Russia, foreign affairs, the economy and labor disputes range from 71% to 78%. Smaller majorities of Democrats approve of his handling of immigration and relations with China.

Democrats are at least twice as likely as independents to approve of Biden on each of the nine issues. Republicans’ approval on seven of the issues is in the single digits. Race relations (16%) and the situation in Ukraine (13%) garner slightly higher approval ratings from Republicans.

###Embeddable###

Bottom Line

Americans’ approval of Biden’s overall job as president and his handling of nine issues are generally steady and are middling at best, topping out at 47% on Ukraine. Democrats remain firm in their approval of him, but his weakest ratings among his base are for his handling of immigration and relations with China. Less than half of independents approve of the president’s performance on any of the measures, including a 39% overall job approval rating from this key group.

As the 2024 presidential campaign begins to heat up, there will be increased focus on Biden’s approval rating and its implications for his electability. If he continues to struggle to earn ratings above the low 40s, history suggests he would be unlikely to win reelection.

Two years ago, President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which makes historic and much–needed investments in improving transportation infrastructure, modernizing the electric grid, expanding access to high-speed internet, cleaning up legacy pollution, replacing lead pipes, and building a clean energy economy. The law also includes Build America, Buy America requirements to ensure the domestic manufacturing of construction materials including iron and steel and to incentivize the domestic production of electric vehicle charging stations, fiber optic cable for high-speed internet, and water infrastructure parts. In the short run, researchers have projected that the law will support hundreds of thousands of jobs, primarily in construction and manufacturing. In the long run, the law is designed to enhance productivity and deliver broad-based economic growth.

While many of the economic benefits of the legislation will play out over the coming years and decades, job gains in construction industries suggest that some benefits have already begun to emerge.

The construction sector is highly cyclical, with employment growing during economic expansions and declining during recessions. Consistent with this trend, the economy has added 670,000 jobs in construction since President Biden took office in January 2021—an average of 20,000 jobs per month. This is a slightly faster pace than in the years before the pandemic, with some sub-sectors—heavy and civil engineering and construction of buildings—seeing much faster growth than pre-pandemic. Employment in the construction sector has exceeded the pre-Great Recession high for the first time, with last month setting a new record high going back to the start of the data in 1939.

Job gains in the construction industry are particularly beneficial to American workers, as these jobs tend to be relatively high-paying. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to further improve the quality of these jobs, such as by requiring the use of project labor agreements for large-scale federal construction projects and updating the Davis Bacon Prevailing Wage Rule for the first time in nearly 40 years, raising pay for more than one million construction workers over time.

To better understand recent developments in construction employment and the effects of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, this blog explores two major sub-industries of the construction sector: heavy and civil engineering and construction of buildings. It identifies unusually rapid job gains in both industries, largely driven in recent months by employment growth in highway, street, and bridge construction and in nonresidential building construction. These developments are consistent with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s success in creating good jobs for American workers in construction.

Employment in Heavy and Civil Engineering

The heavy and civil engineering industry comprises establishments that work on engineering projects, such as building utility systems, roads, bridges, and transit. Employment gains in this industry, especially road and bridge construction (which is often funded by the federal government), provide a good initial indicator of the effects of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

In the latest data, since the President took office, overall employment in heavy and civil engineering was at a series high (data go back to 1990). Since the start of the Administration, the sector has added 92,400 jobs, with much of the recent growth coming from employment in highway, street, and bridge construction (Figure 1).

Looking at the more detailed sub-sectors, since January 2021, the highway, street, and bridge construction industry has added 38,300 jobs, 37,600 of which were added after the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed into law in November 2021 (Figure 2). In January 2023, employment in highway, street, and bridge construction finally surpassed its pre-Great Recession high, continuing to grow since and setting a new series high (data go back to 1990) in the latest data. This pace of job growth is notably strong; whereas from 2011-2019, the industry added an average of 700 jobs per month, over the past year, it has added four times that amount—2,800 jobs per month.

Employment in the Construction of Buildings

The construction of buildings industry is composed of establishments that are primarily responsible for the construction of buildings, including new construction, additions, alterations, maintenance and repairs. It is typically subdivided into residential building construction (single-family and multi-family homes) and nonresidential building construction (factories, offices, airports, warehouses, and more). Job gains in the construction of buildings, particularly nonresidential buildings like manufacturing facilities, airports, bus terminals, factories, and warehouses, suggest progress with implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the rest of the President’s Investing in America agenda.

Like heavy and civil engineering, the industry has seen striking gains in recent years. Since January 2021, the industry has added 187,000 jobs, with job gains roughly evenly split between residential building construction (93,000) and nonresidential building construction (94,000). Whereas initial employment gains in building construction were driven by residential building, gains since mid-2022 have been driven by increases in nonresidential construction (Figure 3). Notably, as shown in Figure 4, nonresidential building construction employment has now reached a series high (data go back to 1990). The pace of job gains in nonresidential building construction also exceeds that of previous periods of growth; over the last year, nonresidential building construction has added an average of 3,800 jobs per month, well above the average between 2011 and 2019 of 1,800 and the average between 2004 and 2007 of 2,200. Notably, these job gains have come as spending on the construction of manufacturing facilities has hit record highs.

Conclusion

Strong employment growth in two critical sub-industries of construction indicate that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already taking effect by stimulating demand for high-paying construction jobs that are rebuilding our nation’s roads, bridges, pipes, and more. Moving forward, investments in workforce development will help meet this demand and increase access to the industry for underrepresented groups. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law newly enabled states to invest in workforce development using their highway formula funds, which total nearly $250 billion over five years. More than half of states are already taking advantage of this flexibility, investing $39 million to prepare their workforces for high-quality jobs in construction and other transportation-related occupations.

Moreover, developments in construction employment are just one measure of how implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has progressed in the last two years, reflecting only a subset of the near-term benefits of infrastructure investment. Since President Biden took office, the Administration has announced nearly $400 billion in public infrastructure and clean energy investments, with 40,000 infrastructure projects moving forward. Economic research suggests that as these infrastructure investments continue to progress, additional benefits for American families—including increased productivity and economic growth—will emerge."

From its first week in office, the Biden administration has described “environmental justice” as one its top priorities. The environmental justice (EJ) movement began in the 1980s as an effort to make sure environmental rules were fairly enforced in poor and minority communities. But Biden’s EJ agenda goes far beyond that reasonable approach.

The administration asserts that certain communities are unfairly burdened by pollution and “on the frontlines of the climate crisis” based mostly on socioeconomic factors. In response, the White House has launched the “Justice40 Initiative,” a policy mandating that 40% of the benefits from climate and environmentally oriented programs must flow to these “EJ communities.”

The amount of spending that is subject to Biden’s 40% rule is enormous: For example, roughly half of the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is earmarked for projects that are arguably environment- or climate-related.

In a series of sweeping executive orders, the White House describes its EJ agenda as an “all-of government” reform that will change the focus of virtually every federal agency. But details about how the program will be implemented—in particular, what constitutes a “benefit” and how to satisfy the 40% rule—remain vague. Nonetheless, it is possible to anticipate the following problems:

Biden’s EJ agenda diverts spending and administrative resources away from traditional environmental priorities—such as reducing air and water pollution and lowering greenhouse gas emissions—and directs them toward amorphous social goals.

The EJ agenda also makes government programs less focused and less effective across the board.

Ironically, the inefficiencies imposed by EJ policies will be particularly burdensome for environmental and infrastructure projects.

Introduction

On January 27, 2021, his seventh full day in office, President Joseph Biden signed Executive Order 14008, “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.”[1] The order committed his administration to an array of policies aimed at pushing the U.S. toward economy-wide, “net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The document also created a new guideline, known as the “Justice40 Initiative,” specifying that 40% of the benefits from climate and environmentally oriented programs must flow to specific disadvantaged communities known as “environmental justice communities.” Biden’s order states: “It is therefore the policy of my Administration to secure environmental justice and spur economic opportunity for disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment in housing, transportation, water and wastewater infrastructure, and health care.”[2]

To help implement this agenda, the order created the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, consisting largely of representatives from community-based activist groups, and elevated an existing interagency working group to become the Environmental Justice Interagency Council, which includes more than a dozen Cabinet secretaries, along with other key administration officials. Together with seven additional executive orders[3] and related announcements, Biden’s EO 14008 represents a profound realignment of federal programs and spending priorities, all set in motion without congressional approval and with almost no public debate.

For most Americans, the general notion of “environmental justice” sounds reasonable. If communities are unfairly burdened with pollution due to discrimination, it seems appropriate for the government to intervene. Like other calls for “equity” and “fairness,” Biden’s environmental justice (EJ) agenda receives little pushback or scrutiny in the media. Yet the policies launched with EO 14008 require virtually all federal agencies to embrace a new set of priorities that reshuffle—and, in some cases, undermine—the goals that those agencies were established to pursue. Not surprisingly, these sweeping policies are already spreading confusion and inefficiency throughout the federal bureaucracy. Moreover, while they employ the language of environmentalism, Biden’s EJ policies attempt to replace traditional environmental objectives—such as saving habitats or reducing greenhouse gas emissions—with a much broader set of progressive social goals.

The administration’s EJ initiatives build on a philosophical and legal movement that dates back to the 1980s. The movement’s pioneers—positing that minority communities were more likely to be chosen as sites for toxic-waste repositories and subjected to higher levels of air and water pollution—developed the concept of environmental racism[4] to explain the disparity. These arguments informed President Clinton’s 1994 Executive Order 12898,[5] and they have since been marshaled in efforts to implement EJ principles at the state level in roughly two dozen states.[6]

But the Biden administration’s policies go significantly further, and they have less basis in the existing scholarly literature. While there is at least some scientific research to suggest that pollution disproportionately affects minorities and the poor, the White House’s new “climate justice” agenda is premised on the claim that these same communities are invariably “on the frontlines of climate change”—which can be supported only by tendentious interpretations of spotty evidence.

In addition to adopting a broader conception of the EJ mission, the current administration also has vastly more money to spend on these initiatives. Under Biden, liberals in Congress have had spectacular success in passing major spending bills. Roughly half of the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is earmarked for projects that are arguably environment- or climate-related.[7] At the time the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that bill’s climate and energy provisions would cost $392 billion over 10 years. But a recent report from Goldman Sachs estimates that IRA’s various green subsidies will cost as much as $1.2 trillion over that period, due to uncapped tax credits for electric vehicles, green energy manufacturing, and other green technologies.[8] Assuming that this and future administrations execute these policies in accordance with Justice40 guidelines, that would mean that hundreds of billions in future federal spending will be subject to the 40% rule.

Biden’s EJ policies have generally rolled out more slowly than the administration initially promised. But as his presidency enters the final third of its current term, several EJ milestones have been passed: In May 2021, the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council[9] (WHEJAC) issued its initial recommendations,[10] which range from pragmatic (reducing urban air pollution; replacing lead pipes for drinking water) to wildly unrealistic (“100% renewable electricity by 2030”). The following year, the White House launched a Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST),[11] which designates 37% of U.S. census tracts as “disadvantaged communities.” The White House also promised a periodically updated Environmental Justice Scorecard to keep track of how federal agencies are complying with the Justice40 mandates. After several delays, the EJ Scorecard[12] was unveiled on April 21, 2023, alongside a new Executive Order titled “Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All.”[13] That most recent order established a new White House Office of Environmental Justice and placed further demands on federal agencies to meet EJ goals.“ Environmental justice will be the mission of the entire government woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal and territorial governments,” the president said.[14]

According to the White House, the Justice40 Initiative “seeks to address the intersectionality of underinvestment, environmental injustice, and the climate crisis.”[15] But crucial details about this revolutionary, government-wide policy shift remain vague. For example, the executive order mandates that 40% of the “benefits” of federal environmental programs must flow to designated communities. But the concept of benefits is only loosely defined. In one major sticking point, would nationwide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions satisfy the requirement? Or would EJ rules imply that 40% of the money allocated to mitigating pollution should be spent within the designated districts? The latest executive order and the recently unveiled EJ Scorecard aim to hold federal agencies accountable for complying with the 40% requirement. But the metrics used to evaluate the agencies’ performance remain fuzzy, as do the mechanisms by which compliance will be enforced.

Judging by its executive orders and public statements, the White House envisions environmental justice as a sweeping reform that will change the focus of virtually every federal agency. As of today, however, Biden’s EJ agenda exists mostly in three forms: concrete spending plans included in the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill; a set of general instructions to federal agencies laid out in a series of executive orders; and various notional goals articulated by White House staffers and EJ advisors. Only a few of the administration’s EJ initiatives currently exist as ongoing programs with measurable results.

One policy area that is changing rapidly is EPA’s program awarding grants to not-for-profit community groups for local environmental initiatives such as air-quality monitoring and green jobs training. That process has been put on steroids. EPA’s budget has quadrupled since fiscal year 2021,[16] and the eventual sum earmarked for nonprofits is enormous. The Inflation Reduction Act[17] alone sets aside $3 billion for “environmental and climate justice block grants.” What standards are being used to select these grassroots organizations? What sorts of oversight will be in place to guard against fraud, abuse, or simply the inefficient use of funds? Republicans in Congress recently raised concerns that EPA grants programs might become a “slush fund for far-left organizations.”[18]

It is true that some of Biden’s EJ policies will bring tangible benefits to poor and neglected communities. For example, the administration frequently cites programs to cap toxic leaks from abandoned mines in rural and tribal regions and to replace lead drinking-water pipes in communities, including Flint, Michigan. But those and similar programs could easily exist without sweeping executive orders—in fact, they do. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill allocates $50 billion to upgrading drinking-water systems around the U.S., including $15 billion dedicated to replacing lead pipes.[19] That bill also earmarks $11 billion for cleaning up abandoned mines.[20] Those programs can move forward as Congress has mandated, whether or not they are described as part of an EJ agenda.

If other similar problems exist, they, too, can be addressed by Congress. In short, one can easily accept that certain communities have suffered disproportionate environmental harms without concluding that the only solution is to reorganize the entire government around a poorly defined goal of “environmental equity.”

At the same time, advocates for an across-the-board EJ agenda tend to discount the burdens that these policies will impose. In addition to the costs that it places on taxpayers, the EJ project threatens to damage the economic prospects of poor communities and undermine some key environmental goals that EJ supporters claim to support. Overall, Biden’s EJ agenda will potentially have negative impacts that far exceed any modest benefits. Even as many details of the policy remain loosely defined, it is possible to anticipate the following problems:

Biden’s EJ agenda diverts spending and administrative resources away from straightforward environmental goals, such as reducing air and water pollution and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Under the mandate that 40% of program “benefits” must specifically help marginalized communities, agencies will be forced to prioritize programs in those districts even if the favored projects are only loosely connected with traditional environmental priorities.

The EJ agenda also makes government programs less focused and less effective across the board. Even the Department of Defense and other agencies involved in national security are now required to “embed environmental justice into all aspects of their work.” This process requires diverting staff, resources, and executive focus away from critical missions and toward “stakeholder consultation,” “report[ing] data on the benefits directed to disadvantaged communities,” and similar tasks.[21]

Ironically, the inefficiencies imposed by EJ policies will be particularly burdensome for environmental and infrastructure projects. New recordkeeping requirements and greater public engagement are adding layers of bureaucracy and red tape to existing programs. Obtaining permits for infrastructure projects will become even more time-consuming. Moreover, EJ policies restrict where projects can be located and include myriad cost-boosting demands, such as incentives that favor union workers. These provisions will make clean energy and other projects more expensive and delay their completion. At a time when this administration insists that the world is in a “climate emergency,” its own EJ policies will slow down progress toward meeting emissions objectives. EJ policies will also raise new hurdles to private industry, restricting job opportunities, particularly in poor communities.

In assessing this agenda as a whole, it is important to note that today’s EJ movement has two wings. On one side is what we might call “practical EJ.” This group focuses on tangible disparities in environmental harm: higher levels of particulate pollution in poor neighborhoods, say, or pesticide exposure among low-income farmworkers. They tend to favor pragmatic solutions. The other group could be characterized as “extreme EJ.” These activists have their roots in an older far-left worldview, one that aims for radical social change and regards the traditional environmental movement with skepticism. These activists see pollution and climate change as manifestations of a racist, exploitative society. In its more extreme form, the EJ movement embodies a set of progressive beliefs, including the claim that “systemic racism” continues to shape all aspects of American society, that the “lived experiences” of marginalized people are a better guide to policy than scientific data, and that capitalism is at the root of most social and environmental problems. As a result, they tend to be less interested in incremental environmental improvements. Instead,

they aim to fundamentally change our underlying political and economic systems. These changes would include shutting down what they call the “extractive economy,” and launching a “just transition”[22] to a kind of postcapitalist society in which energy and food are produced locally and businesses are communally owned.

The two wings of the movement overlap considerably, and both are part of Biden’s EJ coalition. While the most extreme forms of EJ are fully embraced by only the most progressive flank of Biden’s coalition, his EJ policies give these advocates for radical change more power both inside and outside the government, including on WHEJAC. Through its EJ grant program, the administration is also in the process of handing out billions in funding that is likely to go to community nonprofits involved in political advocacy, in addition to local environmental projects. Most Americans support broad environmental goals.[23] But under the anodyne banner of “environmental justice,” some radical activists hope to remake U.S. society along a collectivist model that few Americans support. Nonetheless, the Biden administration has invited many of these activists to play a central role in shaping U.S. policy.

This report will outline the history and philosophy of the EJ movement in both its practical and extreme forms. It will document the high costs and risks of organizing U.S. environmental, energy, and infrastructure policies on the EJ model. And it will argue that environmental and climate issues are best addressed through pragmatic, results-oriented policies, not a vague and politically driven EJ framework.

The Birth of a New Environmental Paradigm

The environmental justice movement first came to national attention in Warren County, North Carolina, in 1982. State officials, grappling with the cleanup of PCB-laden soils, had chosen the poor, black-majority district as the location for a toxic-waste landfill. NAACP and other civil rights groups joined local residents in protesting the facility. Over a period of six weeks, more than 500 people were arrested trying to stop trucks from unloading their materials at the site.[24]

The protests didn’t stop the landfill, but they helped bring the concept of “environmental racism” into mainstream discourse. Activists, academics, and policymakers began taking seriously the claim that the impact of toxic wastes, air pollution, and other environmental harms falls disproportionately on poor, minority communities. The Warren County activists’ immediate claims were vindicated when state engineers later determined that the landfill threatened to contaminate groundwater and would itself need to be remediated.[25]

More broadly, Warren County’s travails with toxic waste came to be seen as paradigmatic. The protests spurred a wave of studies examining the relationship between the siting of toxic-waste facilities and the racial and socioeconomic makeup of the surrounding communities. In 1983, in response to a request by Walter E. Fauntroy, a black pastor who was Washington, DC’s nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the General Accounting Office studied the demographics of the areas surrounding four Southern toxic-waste sites, finding that blacks made up the majority of the population near three of the four sites studied.[26] This was followed by a national study from the United Church of Christ’s Commission for Racial Justice, “Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States,” which found, based on zip codes, significantly higher percentages of minority residents in communities with commercial hazardous-waste facilities.[27]

Another milestone was sociologist Robert D. Bullard’s 1990 publication of Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality, which studied the overrepresentation of environmental hazards in minority communities.[28] Considered the “father of environmental justice,” Bullard has published dozens of books on the topic and won many awards for his activism.[29] He is a member of WHEJAC. In 2021, he told Houston Public Media that he hopes that Biden’s policies “do not just make environmental justice a footnote, but make it a headline.”[30]

In response to concerns about environmental inequities, President George H. W. Bush established the Environmental Equity Working Group in 1992. Two years later, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,” which required every federal agency to “make achieving environmental justice part of its mission” by promoting more equitable enforcement of statutes, improving public participation, and conducting research.[31]

Studies over the past two decades have produced a more nuanced picture of the relationship between poverty, race, and pollution. But on the whole, they confirm that levels of pollution are higher in disadvantaged communities. For example, one 2018 study looked at fine-particulate pollution and found that poor people were more exposed in general: “Blacks, specifically, had 1.54 times higher burden than did the overall population.”[32] But the causes for these patterns are less well understood.

In a 2019 paper, economists from Georgia State University, the University of Kentucky, and Duke University reviewed a wide swath of EJ research examining possible causal mechanisms. The authors identified four:[33]

“Disproportionate siting on the firm side”: Firms decide to site their noxious activity in poor/minority neighborhoods from a disregard or malevolence toward the group, a desire for inexpensive land or to be near low-wage laborers or transportation networks that are also characteristic of these neighborhoods, or because they are steered there through government incentives.

“‘Coming to the nuisance’ on the household side”: Lower-income households can’t afford housing in cleaner environments and end up near polluted sites. Conversely, when such sites are cleaned up, housing prices rise, leading to so-called environmental gentrification.

“Market-like coordination of the two”: This model assumes a process of Coasean bargaining[34] between firms and disadvantaged communities, in which residents are willing to put up with some amount of pollution and not assert environmental rights—for example, the right to clean air—in return for compensation from the polluter, in the form of “cash transfers, . . . local jobs, investments in parks and community centers, and so forth.”

“Discriminatory politics and/or enforcement”: The authors cite a number of studies showing that government action against polluters is most strongly associated with the “political power of local communities” but not necessarily with income or race.

The authors conclude, in other words, that the cause of disparities in pollution exposure is multivariate. “Which came first,” the authors ask, “the siting of facilities in a poor, non-white neighborhood, or the sorting of such households near pollution? . . . [T]his problem has proven difficult to unscramble.” Simplistic policy solutions based on preconceived notions of blame for environmental problems are somewhat beside the point. Assuming that antidiscrimination laws are being enforced, racialized explanations—whether involving individual bias or systemic racism—might be empowering for activists, but they do little to address the underlying problems.

A more straightforward approach is to track pollution levels more closely, and then focus enforcement and remediation on the areas at highest risk. This is an approach that some states and cities have used to detect high levels of lead exposure among children.[35] One such project in New York City’s Williamsburg neighborhood, for example, identified lead hot spots affecting the city’s Hasidic Jewish community, among others.[36] If the EJ paradigm is correct, such monitoring will detect higher pollution levels in poor and minority communities, and those problems can be promptly addressed. If the relationship between pollution and population distribution is more nuanced, a monitoring-based approach will allow scarce remediation resources to be targeted more accurately. It is not clear that most EJ activists would endorse this approach, however. As we will see below, many activists see environmental funding as a form of economic and political empowerment for their communities; reducing levels of specific pollutants is only one among many goals.

A 1998 book by Brookings Institution senior fellow Christopher H. Foreman, The Promise and Peril of Environmental Justice, offered a compelling case, from a mainstream liberal perspective, that “environmental justice” may be more harmful than helpful to community goals. Foreman brings a unique perspective to the issue. As a black Harvard Ph.D. specializing in public health, Foreman is sympathetic to the goal of protecting health in minority communities. He observes that, for many activists, EJ claims “are mostly about accountability and political power rather than the more technical issue of environmental risks facing communities.”[37] “Empirical support for claims of disproportionate pollution impacts and discriminatory regulatory enforcement is actually much weaker than environmental justice advocates usually admit,”[38] he writes. As a result, Foreman concludes: “Environmental justice advocacy probably directs community attention away from those problems posing the greatest risks and may therefore have the ironic effect of undermining public health in precisely the communities it endeavors to help.”[39]

Twenty-five years later, Foreman’s analysis still rings true. While the EJ literature includes many examples of rigorous research, many of the movement’s leading activists tend to focus more on compelling narratives of environmental victimization. These narratives endure even when their factual foundations are shaky. For example, discussions of the impact of highway construction on minority communities invariably mention New York’s “Power Broker,” Robert Moses. In a 2020 interview with Democracy Now!, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez described the Cross Bronx Expressway as “a notorious project of racism by Robert Moses.”[40] Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg described the bridges on Long Island parkways designed by Moses as being too low to accommodate buses “carrying mostly black and Puerto Rican kids to a beach,” which “obviously reflects racism that went into those design choices.”[41]

Yet both stories about New York’s highways are myths. The population of the South Bronx was two-thirds non-Hispanic white in 1950, just before Moses began work on the Cross Bronx Expressway;[42] and there were bus and other public transportation routes to Jones Beach and other Moses-built beaches.[43] Other urban highway design choices, such as Interstate 375 in Detroit, may have been influenced by racist decision-making;[44] but the fact that leaders continue to cite environmental racism where none existed shows how compelling the narrative remains. Both stories reinforce the moral dimension of the EJ paradigm: the claim that pollution exposure isn’t merely an artifact of living in a poor neighborhood but a “targeted,” deliberate, racist imposition.[45]

After Clinton’s Executive Order 12898, federal EJ policy initially leaned toward the practical side, focusing on cases where discriminatory policies led to the siting of pollution sources in minority communities or on lax enforcement of environmental rules. This commonsense approach to EJ had bipartisan support. But the policy shifted during Clinton’s second term, when EPA adopted a new rule applying a “disparate impact” standard to the environmental permitting process. As Reason magazine stated in 1998, under the previous standard, in order to prove that a permit had been granted in violation of federal civil rights law, litigants would have to show that the decision to locate a facility in a minority community was done deliberately and with “discriminatory intent.” Now, it was enough to show that a facility would have a “disparate impact” on minorities.

As Reason pointed out, the rule gave “fringe activist groups a potential veto over any future or existing industrial future or existing industrial facility that needs federal permitting. ‘All it takes is a postcard,’ ” one critic of the policy said.[46]

The EPA move empowered activist groups to oppose a host of projects on EJ grounds, including some that might have provided jobs and opportunity—with minimal environmental costs—in minority communities. The Reason report documented how a proposed chemical plant in impoverished Romeville, Louisiana—one that met all emissions requirements and promised to hire local workers—ran afoul of EPA’s new rule. “The EPA has blocked Shintech from building its plant in poor and black Romeville because Romeville is … poor and black,” the magazine concluded.[47]

Over the next two decades, advocates for a more radical EJ approach gained ground ideologically, especially at the grassroots. Boosted by the Occupy Wall Street movement and further elevated during Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaigns, progressive ideas gained traction through the aughts and teens. At the same time, concerns about climate change were growing. Many left-leaning activists—including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg[48] and Canadian writer Naomi Klein[49]—argued that capitalism and economic growth were the main culprits. Grassroots activists wove those threads together, launching regional and national groups that combined calls for tackling climate and environmental issues with demands for social and economic “justice.” These groups included Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services (or T.E.J.A.S.), the Just Transition Alliance, the Climate Justice Alliance, and many more. Many of these organizations combine projects fighting local pollution with expansive progressive goals. In their literature, the term “environmental justice” serves to describe a much broader agenda. As the Brookings Institution’s Foreman noted, the EJ paradigm “provides a rubric under which to reiterate familiar economic redistributive claims and to propose new avenues of redress.”[50] The Climate Justice Alliance, for example, describes its mission as working for “regenerative economic solutions and ecological justice—under a framework that challenges capitalism and both white supremacy and hetero-patriarchy.”[51] Among that group’s top priorities is the fight against what opponents call “Cop City,” a planned Atlanta, Georgia, law-enforcement training center that became a magnet for Antifa and other violent, far-left protesters in 2023.[52]

When it came time to seek advice on implementing its EJ policy, the Biden administration reached out to this network of established organizations. WHEJAC’s list of members reads like a Who’s Who of longtime EJ activists, including leaders of the three groups mentioned above.[53] The committee includes an admirable diversity of ethnic, tribal, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and many of its members are highly credentialed leaders in the field. But the White House seemingly made no attempt to seek ideological diversity in recruiting advisors: the group includes no economists, no members of mainstream labor organizations, no for-profit business leaders, and certainly no skeptics of EJ policies in general.

Despite this outreach, not all the Biden administration’s moves have pleased the EJ activist community. One of the White House’s thorniest problems has been defining which Americans—and which communities—qualify as “disadvantaged.” While EJ activists have long focused on race as the paradigmatic focus of environmental injustice, the administration’s CEJST[54] took a non-race-based approach. (The decision to avoid using race as a CEJST metric was likely made in expectation that the Supreme Court would overturn affirmative action in the Students for Fair Admissions case, which it did in June 2023.[55] While that case concerned college admissions, legal experts believe that the ruling will make other race-based policies more vulnerable to legal challenges.)[56]

The screening tool—which was finally released in February 2022 and revised in November of that year—applies dozens of criteria to each of the country’s 74,000-plus census tracts (as delineated in the 2010 census) to determine whether a tract qualifies as disadvantaged.[57] These include proximity to hazardous-waste facilities; exposure to airborne particulates; traffic volume; income and education levels; rates of asthma, diabetes, and heart disease; and whether a community appeared on “redlining” maps from the 1930s. The tool puts significant portions of most U.S. cities in the disadvantaged category, as well huge swaths of rural America, including most of Oregon and West Virginia. (Federally recognized tribal lands are automatically designated disadvantaged.) In all, 37% of census tracts and 33.2% of residents—109 million Americans in all—fall under the screening tool’s “disadvantaged” banner.[58]

According to an analysis by the climate-advocacy site Grist, CEJST metrics do function as a rough proxy for race: the higher the percentage of nonwhite residents in a tract, the more likely it is to be identified as disadvantaged.[59] Nonetheless, many EJ activists were displeased that the screening tool does not focus explicitly on race. Movement icon Bullard told the New York Times: “When you look at the most powerful predictor of where the most industrial pollution is, race is the most potent predictor…. Not income, not property values, but race. If you’re leaving race out, how are you going to fix this?”[60] Bullard and others worry about the racial composition of the designated tracts, as detailed by Grist: “While tracts with a higher percentage of nonwhite residents are more likely to be flagged by the tool, the system also flags about 3,500 tracts where 20 percent or fewer residents identify as non-white. Likewise, the tool leaves out more than 2,200 tracts where 80 percent or more of the population identify as non-white.”[61]

The decision to exclude race from the screening tool dismayed members of WHEJAC. After reviewing a prepublication draft of the report, 10 members of the group wrote to the White House, asking, “Will this skew results away from, for example, African Americans?” “We need to get assurances,” WHEJAC member Elizabeth Yeampierre, cochair of the Climate Justice Alliance in New York, told a Greenwire reporter: “We continued to have concerns about the lack of transparency. Our communities have to be more than poster children to an agenda.”[62]

In April 2023, the administration released the first phase of the Environmental Justice Scorecard, presenting results from 24 agencies—which range from heavy hitters such as EPA and the Departments of Agriculture and Transportation to small-budget entities, including the Denali Commission and the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Scorecard is intended “to provide transparency for the public, and to increase accountability for federal agencies.”[63] In truth, it provides, at best, a fuzzy picture of how EJ priorities are affecting various agencies’ programs. The agencies’ reports included a mix of tangible metrics, such as budget numbers, and amorphous jargon. If it is true that this administration is putting environmental justice “at the center of the federal government’s work,” as the White House said in 2022,[64] it is high time that policy analysts, members of Congress, and the public take a harder look at what that means in practice.

The Case Against Environmental Justice Policies

The philosophical weakness of the EJ cause is not obvious at first. As noted above, there is legitimate evidence that poor and minority groups are exposed to higher levels of many pollutants.[65] The movement’s initial focus—ensuring that pollution regulations are enforced as aggressively in minority communities as they are in mostly white regions—was straightforward and in keeping with American legal tradition: when it comes to laws regarding pollution, all citizens should be treated equally.

Over the decades, however, the focus of the EJ movement evolved. The evolution can be seen clearly in EPA’s adoption, in the late 1990s, of a “disparate impact” standard for challenging new projects, described above. The rule meshed with a growing sense among EJ advocates that all pollution exposure in minority communities should be presumed to be the result of racism. Under this paradigm, it isn’t necessary to look as closely at pollution levels or health impacts, or to weigh the complex factors that contribute to pollution exposure. Pollution is simply defined as a form of racism. And—since racism is ubiquitous in American society, as this view maintains—we can assume that, as a rule, minorities suffer unfair exposure to pollution. Therefore, the modern EJ framework concludes, minority communities are entitled to targeted benefits as a matter of course.

Biden’s EJ policies take this worldview a step further, in claiming that certain communities are “on the front lines of climate change” and are therefore entitled to special programs and funding meant to address that claimed disparity. But unlike the earlier era of EJ policies, which had some scientific backing, these claims have little empirical support.

Climate activists make a reasonable claim that some of the world’s poorest people—residents of low-lying Bangladesh, or farmers in sub-Saharan Africa—are more vulnerable to rising temperatures and sea levels. The same case might be made for Alaska’s tribal populations. But extrapolating similar claims to America’s poor and minority communities in general remains mostly conjecture. These arguments also typically involve generous cherry-picking of examples. For example, activists often point out that many of Houston’s minority neighborhoods are built on low-lying terrain that is more vulnerable to flooding.[66] They are less likely to mention that some of America’s most expensive real estate—including estates in the Hamptons, Florida condos, and Malibu beach houses—also sits in potential flood zones.

Only a handful of studies have examined how those same communities might be affected by climate change. A 2021 EPA study looked at “social vulnerability” in the event of a 2°C increase in global temperature. It found that, on average, minorities are less likely than nonminorities to suffer property damage from either inland or coastal flooding. The most dramatic disparity broken out in the report’s executive summary was merely that “minorities are 41% more likely than nonminorities to currently live in areas with the highest projected increases in traffic delays from high-tide flooding.”[67]

In truth, much talk of “climate impacts” today is a mix of speculative long-range predictions and present-day exaggeration intended to rally support for climate-friendly policies. While the media and green activists—and even some scientists—tend to blame all hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and similar phenomena on climate change, the evidence connecting today’s extreme weather events to global warming remains in contention.[68]

There is reason to believe that continued warming will lead to bigger storms in the future, and it may be contributing to heavier rainfall events today. But tornadoes, wildfires, and hurricanes caused havoc long before today’s focus on climate. People living in substandard housing or in former wetlands have always been at greater risk from tornadoes or flooding. The urban poor living without air conditioning have always been at risk from heat waves. These are principally problems of poverty or poor development planning. Extreme weather events may worsen over coming decades; but for the past century, deaths from weather disasters have actually fallen dramatically.[69]

Predictably, the Biden administration treats the claim of climate vulnerability as a foundational truth, one that doesn’t require scientific support or nuanced policy discussions about how best to address the problem. Prior to issuing Executive Order 14008, the administration held no public meetings on the issue. It empaneled no fact-finding commission. It shared no research identifying the areas where pollution can be clearly correlated with racial or other forms of bias or determining the most effective solutions to those inequities. Biden’s EO 14008 and subsequent EJ policies simply take the foundational claims of the EJ movement as axiomatic—and have made them the foundation not only for policies related to air and water pollution, but also for climate policy. As a result, the administration’s EJ agenda is less scientifically based and more a leap of green faith.

The lack of a serious effort to back up these claims is not surprising because EJ activists typically do not focus on highly technical climate predictions or debates over energy infrastructure; they tend to see warming in political, rather than scientific, terms. Many describe climate change less as a global atmospheric phenomenon and more as a form of economic exploitation. Yeampierre, cochair of the Climate Justice Alliance, expresses this view forthrightly: “Climate change is the result of a legacy of extraction, of colonialism, of slavery,” she told Yale Environment 360.[70] Under this framework, almost any form of economic inequity or social hardship can be redefined as an impact of climate change.

In short, the EJ movement has evolved from one that sought to protect minority communities from environmental discrimination into one that asserts that the government must discriminate in favor of these communities on the basis of vague, unsubstantiated claims. As Christopher Foreman noted in the 1990s: “A major reason why one simply cannot accept advocacy claims of risk at face value is that they are often anchored, ultimately, not in the dangers posed by a site or substance ostensibly at issue, but rather in a desire for transformed power relationships to be achieved on behalf of politically energized and engaged communities.”[71]

It is important to acknowledge that these energized and engaged communities—and the groups that advocate for them—have achieved real victories in improving environmental conditions. Many issues that activists have raised—from water quality in Flint, Michigan, to chemical exposure among farmworkers—deserve attention. At the same time, Foreman recognized that the EJ movement could effectively harness environmental issues to achieve what activists believe are even more important objectives: gaining political power and resources for their communities.[72] It is hard to fault activist groups for using any tool available to help their communities. But it is up to policymakers to develop programs that are based on concrete data and aim for measurable results. The modern EJ paradigm, especially in its extreme form, makes that increasingly difficult.

In reality, pollution levels and racial discrimination have both been significantly reduced since the early days of the EJ movement. According to EPA, between 1970 and 2020, the combined emissions of six key air pollutants (fine and coarse particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and lead) have fallen by 78%.[73] Meanwhile, the assertion that poor and minority communities are uniquely exposed to climate risks remains poorly supported. Nonetheless, the Biden administration is attempting to base the nation’s entire environmental and infrastructure policy on the claim that pollution and climate impacts are severe and that both must be fundamentally understood as examples of racism and injustice.

As we’ve seen, the EJ paradigm is a flawed foundation for environmental policy. But the problems with the EJ agenda are not just ideological. They also introduce a host of pragmatic problems—greater costs, delays, and bureaucratic hurdles—that interfere with the smooth functioning of both government and the private sector. The policies threaten to be especially harmful in four main areas.

Justice40 shifts resources away from traditional environmental goals.

Since the 1960s, U.S. environmental policy has focused on clear-cut goals: preserving open space and habitat; reducing pollution (for the benefit of both humans and wildlife); and—especially in recent decades—cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. In other words, environmental policies centered on the environment. But the modern environmental justice movement—and this administration’s EJ policies—broaden that agenda to include a sweeping array of social and economic priorities. President Biden’s Executive Order 14008 states:

To secure an equitable economic future, the United States must ensure that environmental and economic justice are key considerations in how we govern. That means investing and building a clean energy economy that creates well-paying union jobs, turning disadvantaged communities—historically marginalized and overburdened—into healthy, thriving communities…. It is therefore the policy of my Administration to secure environmental justice and spur economic opportunity for disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment in housing, transportation, water and wastewater infrastructure, and health care.[74]

The executive order makes clear that securing clean air, clean water, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions are not the administration’s only—and perhaps not even its primary—goals. Instead, the White House says that it intends to use these programs as tools to bolster unions, build “healthy, thriving communities,” and fix problems with housing, transportation, and health care. It is not the purpose of this report to argue that those social welfare goals are illegitimate. But the Biden EJ plan redefines social problems as examples of environmental injustice and maintains, in turn, that equitable environmental programs will simultaneously address poverty, housing shortages, and other social ills. In other words, the plan asserts—without evidence—that a single policy can solve both environmental and social problems.

That claim, in turn, rests on a large, but only vaguely articulated, assumption: that costly programs to address pollution and climate change will also spur a social and economic revival in marginalized communities. John Podesta, longtime advisor to Presidents Clinton and Obama, serves as this administration’s Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation. After passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, his team produced a report titled Building a Clean Energy Economy.[75] In a cover letter to that report, Podesta writes that IRA’s goal is to “create good-paying, high-quality jobs and shared economic growth,” adding that “Congress and President Biden designed these programs to benefit working families and parts of the United States that are too often overlooked and underserved.”[76]

In fact, the economic benefits of transitioning from a fossil-fuel-based energy system to one that relies mostly on clean energy are very much in dispute. California, Massachusetts, and some other states making aggressive transitions to renewable energy[77] also have some of the country’s highest electricity prices,[78] creating burdens on businesses and consumers. (Over the past three years, California has lost 500,000 residents as its citizens leave for other, less expensive, states.)[79]

President Biden maintains that phasing out fossil-fuel vehicles in favor of EVs will generate “one million new jobs in the American automobile industry.”[80] Industry analysts disagree. EVs contain fewer parts and take less labor to build than internal combustion vehicles. One study suggests that, globally, some 80,000 jobs in auto manufacturing and supply chains have already been lost in the transition to EVs.[81] Another study predicts that the switch to EVs could cost the U.S. 75,000 automotive jobs by 2030.[82]

In short, claims that the administration’s policies will simultaneously boost economic opportunities while slashing emissions are far from proven. The “Clean Energy Economy” that the White House touts will bring an unpredictable mix of costs and benefits, with no guarantees that they will revitalize poor and minority neighborhoods. If the predicted benefits from clean energy investments don’t naturally flow to the designated communities, future administrations will be pressed to enforce EO 14008’s 40% commitment more aggressively. The IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill already have prevailing wage and domestic content incentives intended to raise the wages of U.S. blue-collar workers. Biden’s executive orders also instruct agencies to locate more projects within EJ communities and to take similar steps to ensure that any economic windfalls reach marginalized groups. In every federal environmental or infrastructure program, the environmental benefits of a project—such as how many tons of CO 2 it will displace—will need to be balanced against EJ goals. The entire thrust of Biden’s Justice40 agenda is to ensure that federal agencies tilt that balance toward social and economic benefits. But when those goals are in conflict, environmental objectives will suffer.

The Justice40 initiative will also force conservation-oriented agencies to juggle competing agendas. For example, the Department of the Interior has a host of programs designed to protect endangered species, preserve wild habitats, and support outdoor recreation. Many of these programs already overlap with EJ goals. For example, the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership promotes recreation projects in economically underserved areas, while other programs support initiatives in tribal regions.[83] But other programs, such as the Bureau of Land Management’s Land and Water Conservation Fund, protect many remote habitats far from population centers.[84] Under the Justice40 rule, future conservation projects of this sort may struggle to prove that 40% of their benefits flow to EJ communities.

More broadly, Justice40 requires environmental policy in general to shift its ethical focus. Traditionally, American environmental policy has put a value on wildlife and wilderness that transcends their economic utility to humans. But Justice40 demands that environmental initiatives must not only show concrete benefits to humans but also help “secure an equitable future,” as EO 14008 puts it.[85] How will efforts to save the endangered sage grouse, for example, or to protect a pristine river, pass muster under such a requirement?

The White House has one powerful tool to ensure that federal resources flow directly to designated EJ communities: issuing grants to local nonprofit organizations. After the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022, EPA administrator Michael Regan told reporters: “We’re going from tens of thousands of dollars to developing and designing a program that will distribute billions.”[86] IRA includes $2.8 billion in grant money that must specifically target disadvantaged communities. It also sets aside $200 million for “technical assistance” related to the grants. The eligible recipients are limited to community-based nonprofit organizations, partnerships of the same, or partnerships between such organizations and “an Indian tribe, a local government, or an institution of higher education.”[87]

This combined $3 billion is an extraordinary amount of money to funnel through nonprofit groups accustomed to operating on relatively tiny budgets. Moreover, there is a time limit: IRA designates that the funds will be available only until September 30, 2026, making it imperative for these agencies to get grants out the door. EPA has devised two programs to expedite the awarding of grants.

First, it has designated 16 entities to serve as Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers (EJ TCTACs), each of which will be responsible for assisting eligible organizations to navigate the federal grant application process for both EPA and Department of Transportation grants.[88] These institutions, which include universities, such as the University of Connecticut and University of Arizona, and nonprofits, such as West Harlem Environmental Action and Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, will each receive $10 million (with a few receiving $12 or $13 million) over five years for their roles in expediting the grant process.[89]

Second, in order to distribute so-called small grants (those up to several hundred thousand dollars), EPA has devised an EJ Thriving Communities Grantmaking program for groups to receive government money without undergoing the cumbersome federal grant application process. The program will select up to 11 “Grantmakers”—eligible organizations and partnerships (with a preference for Minority Serving Institutions)—that will themselves be empowered to award such subgrants, up to a total of $550 million. Each Grantmaker is charged with designing its own outreach, application, project management and support, and evaluation processes for its grants.[90]

The grant language in IRA is extraordinarily general. Under “eligible activities,” it includes “community-led air and other pollution monitoring, prevention, and remediation, and investments in low- and zero-emissions and resilient technologies and related infrastructure and workforce development that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants.”[91] EPA gives little sense as to how activities such as “pollution monitoring” or “workforce development” might fit into nationwide goals or plans. Quite the contrary: the administration has repeatedly insisted that local groups know better than the federal government how to address environmental problems in their communities.

There are several problems with this grant-making approach to environmental problems.

First, it is likely to have a scattershot impact, at best. The grant model assumes, or at least professes to assume, that the nation’s climate goals can be advanced by funding the relatively small goals and projects of local groups. Many in the Biden administration have embraced this “wisdom lies in the community” philosophy. Vice President Kamala Harris said in September 2022, when EPA established its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights: “The establishment of a new office dedicated to advancing environmental justice and civil rights at EPA will ensure the lived experiences of underserved communities are central to our decision-making while supporting community-driven solutions.”[92] Of course, many EJ activists say that the most important benefit of such projects is building political and economic power in their communities. Some even describe direct funding of community projects as a form of reparations.

Second, the grant model lacks accountability. Under the current program, many organizations new to the federal grant process will need to apply for and collectively spend up to $2.8 billion in grant money before the end of September 2026. How is EPA to monitor whether the money has been spent as intended—never mind whether it has achieved the intended results? This question was raised in a well-publicized February 2023 letter from James Comer, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, to EPA administrator Michael Regan. Comer first noted the uncertain results in four programs highlighted in EPA’s own document, “Case Studies from the Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Program,”[93] and then stated:

Along with ill-defined issuance metrics for grant programs, the sheer volume of money flowing through the EPA prompts review of the agency’s ability to properly manage its rapidly inflated budget. The EPA’s total budgetary resources in FY2021 were approximately $17.2 billion, skyrocketing to $76.5 billion in FY2022. The agency must account for its ability to effectively prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of funding that has more than quadrupled within the span of a year.[94]

Third, the model sends the wrong message about EPA’s responsibility and mission. Is EPA’s mission to “protect human health and the environment”—and especially the health and environment for the most vulnerable among us—best achieved through the inefficient process of issuing grants? For example, many environmental nonprofits receive EPA grants to conduct programs to monitor air quality in their neighborhoods.[95] Sending quickly trained workers into the streets with air-monitoring equipment might be helpful in raising awareness about air-quality issues. But do these collected samples contribute scientifically useful data? One recent $498,401 grant was awarded to the Atlanta-based Center for Sustainable Communities for “deploy[ing] air sensors in 11 minority communities, located in the region of South Atlanta, Georgia, where there is concern over potential health impacts due to the proximity of these neighborhoods to heavily traveled transportation corridors, and for which there is no existing air quality monitoring capability.”[96]

Shouldn’t EPA upgrade its own air-quality monitoring instead? If the federal government wants to reassure EJ communities that their interests are its top priority, why ask a community to monitor its own air quality? Cynically, one might ask whether these programs are intended not to solve problems but to give the appearance of solving problems while appeasing community groups clamoring for funding.

Justice40 will hamper government functions across the board.

The Biden administration’s EJ agenda does more than reshuffle the priorities of environmental programs. If the administration’s rhetoric is to be believed, it hopes to implement “fundamental and sweeping reforms to the ways in which the Federal government operates.” What these sweeping reforms will actually mean, however, is vague. In particular, the concept of a “benefit”—the heart of the Justice40 program—remains virtually undefined.

In July 2021, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the National Climate Advisors issued interim implementation guidance for the Justice40 initiative. The document did little to clear up confusion as to the meaning of key terms. “The determination of what constitutes a ‘benefit’ will vary by covered program,” the document stated. Each agency was tasked with developing its own “metrics … to measure covered program benefits.” But first, agencies would have to hold public meetings to ensure that “community stakeholders are meaningfully involved in [defining] what constitutes the ‘benefits’ of a program.” The letter describes an open-ended, never-ending process of community engagement that will be repeated for each new program. In some cases, the requirement to engage with the public will not even be limited to the community in which the project in question is located. Presumably, if an emissions-reduction project in an affluent area will lower pollution levels in a distressed neighborhood downwind, “the disadvantaged community should be consulted” before the project’s benefits can be assessed.[97]

In short, every agency—indeed, every program administered by those agencies—will employ its own unique definition of what constitutes a benefit, and those definitions will vary from community to community. Yet all these mercurial benefits will somehow be subject to the administration’s strict 40% requirement. And every project must be delayed until the requisite “stakeholder consultations” have occurred. Agencies are also urged to incorporate recommendations from WHEJAC and admonished to follow provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act, “other relevant law, regulation, or guidance,” and, of course, “the Paperwork Reduction Act.”[98]

The Environmental Justice Scorecard is intended to be “the first-ever government-wide assessment of what the federal government is doing to advance environmental justice.” But it is also a snapshot of how much time and money federal agencies are being forced to spend on priorities other than their primary missions. Overall, 18 federal agencies provided specific monetary amounts to the Scorecard (six did not report numbers). Those added up to a not inconsiderable $92 billion in claimed expenditures that arguably meet the administration’s malleable conception of an EJ benefit. In a phone interview, the Manhattan Institute asked Matthew Tejada, director of EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice,[99] how his agency defines the term. “We are struggling with that, too,” he said. “Justice40 is looking at hundreds, if not thousands, of existing programs, and it’s not just talking about 40% of the revenue from those programs or the funds of those programs; it’s talking about the benefits of those programs,” Tejada continued. “So that takes it into a much weedier, more detailed, nuanced conversation and understanding about what the policy implementation actually looks like.”

In producing their Scorecard reports, many agencies appear to reframe routine procedures as constituting a benefit to EJ communities. Under “Phase One Scorecard metrics and highlights,” the Department of Defense included: “The Navy selected multiple transportation options for the Pearl Harbor dry dock to help manage traffic, which minimizes impacts on historically overburdened communities.”[100] The fact that the Navy’s effort to reduce Honolulu traffic can’t be numerically quantified does not mean that it has no value. But it does highlight the absurdity of trying to measure every such accommodation by the administration’s 40% metric.

The Scorecard’s tortured language also reveals the necessity for federal agencies to demonstrate fluency in EJ jargon. The Department of Health and Human Services, for example, spends a paragraph describing a single workshop bringing together “regional and local community leaders involved in environmental justice advocacy networks to discuss best practices for community engagement when addressing racism as a public health issue through the lens of environmental health disparities and environmental justice.”[101] Overall, the Scorecard documents the way the Justice40 initiative creates new workload burdens for agency officials attempting to demonstrate compliance with vaguely specified requirements.

EJ policies will undermine both environmental and economic progress.

Ironically, Biden’s EJ agenda is a particular threat to the very priorities that EJ advocates claim to value most: fighting climate change and alleviating poverty. The flaw of the administration’s approach is an example of what New York Times columnist Ezra Klein has called “everything-bagel liberalism.” The key to a perfect bagel, he writes, is to add just the right amount of extra ingredients. But liberal policymakers too often can’t stop adding new ingredients to their programs. Klein continues:

You might assume that when faced with a problem of overriding public importance, government would use its awesome might to sweep away the obstacles that stand in its way. But too often, it does the opposite. It adds goals—many of them laudable—and in doing so, adds obstacles, expenses and delays…. [I]t tries to accomplish so much within a single project or policy that it ends up failing to accomplish anything at all.[102]

This administration’s EJ agenda is a perfect example of this trap. Biden has repeatedly said that “climate change is an emergency.”[103] And the White House describes environmental inequities as a problem so severe that it requires an “all-of-government” solution. But the administration’s EJ agenda is so smothered in rules, requirements, and competing goals that it will be unlikely to achieve many of its objectives. In fact, it is likely to slow progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

In his letter celebrating the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, White House advisor John Podesta wrote that IRA will “accelerate the deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and clean manufacturing.” And the bill will favor “projects that are located in low-income communities or energy communities, pay prevailing wages and use registered apprentices, or meet certain domestic content requirements—all with the goal of creating good-paying, high-quality jobs and shared economic growth.”[104]

Podesta’s framing implies that these goals can all be achieved as happy complements to the administration’s ambitious climate and environmental policies. In truth, of course, many of these objectives are antagonistic to one another. For example, clean energy projects receiving enhanced IRA tax credits will be required to pay the “prevailing wage,” a floor on wages and benefits that is calculated for given regions and that typically mirrors union pay, benefits, and work rules. Studies differ on how much prevailing wage rules increase infrastructure costs. The left-leaning Center for American Progress maintains that the rules “produce good value for taxpayers.”[105] But various studies find that prevailing wage requirements boost infrastructure costs. The New York think tank Empire Center for Public Policy has calculated that that state’s prevailing wage requirements drive public works construction costs up by 13%–25%, depending on the region.[106] In this case, the goal of raising worker wages is clearly at odds with Biden’s ambitious climate targets. If a wind farm being developed with IRA subsidies faces 20% higher labor costs due to the prevailing wage requirement, the result will be fewer wind turbines. But the White House tends to ignore this issue. Indeed, the administration maintains the fiction that EJ and clean energy goals can both be achieved without trade-offs.

Ironically, it is not even clear that the administration’s prevailing wage requirements will actually help the presumed beneficiaries of EJ policies: minority workers. “Historically, prevailing wage legislation has been a disaster for minority construction workers,” writes David Bernstein, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, in a 2017 survey of research on the racial impact of prevailing wage laws. Until recently, “construction labor unions have been among the most vociferously exclusionary entities in the United States,” the author notes. While labor unions are less openly discriminatory today, he writes, minorities remain underrepresented in many unions. “Given that prevailing wage laws tend to operate to exclude nonunion labor in favor of union labor,” Bernstein concludes, “this works to the detriment of minority workers who are subject to union discrimination.”[107]

This proliferation of new offices, rules, and reporting requirements not only creates bureaucratic hurdles for federal and state agencies; it also burdens the private sector. Biden’s ambitious climate plans aim to incentivize massive public and private investments in transmission lines, renewable energy, and other infrastructure. Policy experts who support the White House plan say that executing this huge construction campaign will require relaxing the onerous National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process.[108] But rather than streamlining project approvals, the latest EO requires that NEPA reviews are carried out with even stricter attention to the “direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of Federal actions on communities with environmental justice concerns.” The order also ratchets up the requirements for “early and meaningful” community involvement.[109]

In addition, Biden’s order introduces a subtle but potentially consequential change in official language. Clinton’s EO 12898 required agencies to address “disproportionately high and adverse” environmental impacts.[110] Biden’s order swaps in the simpler but broader phrase “disproportionate and adverse.” As the National Law Review notes, “this change could effectively lower the bar for what stakeholders or federal agencies consider significant impacts.”[111] In other words, at a time when the White House promised voters an unprecedented clean energy building spree, it is adding new hurdles and delays to the already-tortuous NEPA process.

Justice40 embeds a far-left worldview within federal agencies.

In a 2021 op-ed in The Hill, WHEJAC cochair Richard Moore explained how his career in activism—which started as a member of the New Mexico Black Berets, who were modeled on the Black Panthers[112]—gradually evolved to include environmental problems.[113] “For us, environmental issues were—and are—inseparable from the larger struggle for social justice,” he wrote. In a roundtable discussion sponsored by the Center for American Progress and hosted by John Podesta, Moore gave a vivid account of what he believes he and his fellow activists are up against. “When we look at our sisters and brothers, not only throughout this country, but in Puerto Rico and Alaska, and other locations, we very clearly are experiencing the impact of not only cumulative impact, but climate injustice, environmental racism, and environmental genocide.”[114]

When the EJ movement’s most respected leaders see environmental issues in such apocalyptic terms, it’s easy to understand why they believe that the true problem is much bigger than particulate levels or lead pipes. Many EJ activists see racism and capitalism as the intertwined root causes of all environmental woes. “Systematic racism and social injustice are at the root of the environmental problems we are trying to address,” Earthjustice president Abigail Dillen told Politico. Attacking those problems “is mission critical.”[115] While the fight to reduce pollution is important, these activists believe, it must be seen as a means to that greater end.

As an alternative to today’s market economy, many EJ activists embrace what they call a “Just Transition,” a pivot away from “extractive industries” (such as fossil fuels) and toward a more communally based economy. The Climate Justice Alliance advocates for a “Just Transition away from extractive systems of production, consumption and political oppression, and towards resilient, regenerative and equitable economies. We believe that the process of transition must place race, gender and class at the center of the solutions equation.” The solution to environmental oppression, the group argues, requires “collective worker and community control of land, water, and food resources.”[116]

Just Transition advocates describe urban neighborhoods transformed into neo-pastoral collectives in which food is grown via “regenerative agriculture” in community gardens, energy is produced in locally controlled, renewable power grids, and wealth is somehow spontaneously generated and equitably shared. While the extreme form of this idea might seem a socialist fantasy, anyone who enjoys shopping at farmers’ markets can appreciate the emotional appeal of this general vision. As the Brookings Institution’s Foreman wrote a quarter-century ago, the environmental justice movement’s “ultimate roots lie in the eternal yearning for a more democratic and egalitarian society composed of livable communities.”[117]

These communitarian ideals are not just hazy visions of the future. For many EJ activists, these notions of a “postcapitalist economy” help shape which environmental policies (and technologies) they embrace or reject today. WHEJAC submitted its initial list of recommendations in May 2021. The document provides an eye-opening summary of the kinds of fundamental transformations that these EJ activists believe to be possible and desirable. A cover letter, written by Moore and cochair Peggy M. Shepard, demands: “Justice40 must include taking bold action to sunset investment by 2030 in fossil fuels, plastics, dangerous chemicals and nuclear energy and to set requirements for 100% renewable electricity by 2030.”[118]

WHEJAC recommendations include a long list of technologies, policies, and infrastructure projects that these White House advisors oppose. (Much of the list is copied directly from New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal bill.) Under “Examples of the types of projects that will not benefit a community,” the memo predictably includes existing transportation and energy sources, recommending against “Road improvements or automobile infrastructure,” “Fossil fuel procurement, development, [or] infrastructure repair,” and investments in transmission lines that might carry electricity produced by fossil fuels. But the document also inveighs against many technologies and policies advocated by leading climate advocates, including carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, systems that would directly capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and carbon markets (including cap and trade programs). For good measure, the list also warns against “research and development.”[119]

By the standards of traditional environmentalism, WHEJAC’s list of unacceptable climate remedies is stunningly ideological. It suggests that the memo’s authors don’t believe that the fight against climate change is as important as their battles against our high-tech, market-based economy. On the other hand, the group uncritically embraces all manner of communitarian solutions: subsidies for local food cooperatives and community gardens; grants and training programs for “Black organic & regenerative farmers”; “comprehensive wage replacement” for dislocated workers; free broadband; plans to forgive unpaid utility bills; and more.

WHEJAC does, however, embrace some new technology when it calls for locally based solar power. The WHEJAC report recommends that the departments of Energy and Housing and Urban Development “deploy at least 3 gigawatts of local solar on HUD assisted housing by 2025.” The report also calls for funding “rooftop/on-site/localized solar and battery energy storage systems,” rewiring urban power systems into community “microgrids,” and the “decentralization of grid ownership.” The idea of community-controlled microgrids is popular among progressive activists. The concept is based on microgrid systems in Texas and elsewhere that combine power production and distribution in small regions that can be made independent from the larger power grid in the event of a blackout. This approach can be useful for some specialized applications, such as college campuses.[120] But the operation of microgrids entirely on renewable power and battery storage remains in the early research phase and far from economic feasibility.[121]

For activists, however, the concept of locally produced and distributed power meshes with Just Transition philosophy: it promises community control and independence from presumably exploitative corporations. NAACP, for example, supports initiatives “aimed at improving solar energy access to marginalized communities.” Jacqueline Patterson, director of that group’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program, told Scientific American that clean energy “is just another dimension of social justice.” Local renewable power, she added, “puts us in control of our energy.”[122] The activists’ goals are clear: they want local empowerment, control, and funding. In their view, if the federal government is subsidizing grid-scale solar farms in the countryside, those solar panels should go on low-income rooftops instead.

These EJ goals are in conflict with efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible. The Biden administration has set a target to have the U.S. electric grid be entirely carbon-free by 2035.[123] Yet studies indicate that utility-scale solar panel systems generate power at a much lower cost than do residential rooftop panels: about one-third lower, according to a study of first-quarter 2022 prices by a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory.[124] In other words, federal policies focused on promoting residential rooftop solar would conceivably spend about 50% more to produce a given level of electricity. Even in an era of trillion-dollar federal programs, money is not infinite. The Inflation Reduction Act contains a number of tax credits and incentives that can be applied to distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrids.[125] Continued research into the concept could yield improved grid reliability in the future. But in the near term, a focus on distributed power is likely to delay, rather than facilitate, the goal of rapid decarbonization.

The Biden administration has muddied the waters on this policy question. Is the ultimate goal achieving a net-zero power grid? Or is it empowering marginalized communities and hiring workers to install solar panels on public housing? By encouraging the fiction that economic equity and emissions reductions go hand in hand, the Justice40 framework makes it difficult to weigh these conflicting goals. But clearly, when the federal government is investing hundreds of billions in clean energy, determining the efficiency of different approaches is paramount. For WHEJAC and other EJ activists, of course, efficiency of federal programs is a footnote, at best. To EJ activists, success will be measured by ideological metrics—as well as by how much money and influence flows to their communities—not emission reductions. And, as they continually stress, the activists’ goals go far beyond reducing pollution; they want environmental programs to spin off benefits in the realms of housing, employment, and other objectives. In a sense, therefore, the activist community favors projects that are as inefficient as possible: from their perspective, the best projects are not the ones that most effectively reduce emissions but those that spend the most money and hire the most workers in EJ communities.

The WHEJAC committee has no official or permanent role in setting U.S. policy. Quite possibly, its more extreme recommendations will be politely ignored by administration officials. (The White House has not moderated its strong support for nuclear power, for example.) But it is more than plausible that the extreme EJ worldview that WHEJAC espouses will filter into the federal bureaucracy and quietly influence the implementation of federal programs. The administration’s EJ grant program also seems likely to prioritize funding of highly ideological local groups. The White House has already recruited several groups espousing an extreme EJ agenda to advise grant applicants and distribute grants. Many of the local groups likely to receive grants do useful projects. But money is fungible. Skeptics of the program have a right to ask what political activities these groups are also engaged in. In their letter to EPA administrator Regan, Congressmen James Comer and Pat Fallon asked whether EPA’s EJ grant program might become “a slush fund for far-left organizations.” That language might raise hackles, but the question is valid.

White House officials often repeat a platitude used by EJ activists: residents of marginalized communities know better than the federal government how to address environmental problems in their neighborhoods. On one level, respect for the voices of people in poor communities is a good thing; no one wants the federal government running roughshod over the concerns of residents. But living in a poor region does not confer automatic expertise in which technologies most effectively reduce emissions, or how best to run the power grid. Such decisions require technical know-how and should be either relegated to markets (which typically do a better job of allocating resources) or made by qualified policymakers implementing clear policies that reward concrete results.

Justice40 is anything but a clear policy. By muddling the contradiction between environmental and social welfare priorities, it gives activists more flexibility to favor their progressive goals, even at the cost of undermining the administration’s stated green agenda.

The Manhattan Institute asked the EPA’s Tejada about how EJ concerns might force a trade-off between green projects that provide more benefits to marginalized communities and those that deliver faster reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. He answered candidly:

I’ve heard folks talk about this a lot, “We’ve got to solve climate change; all this equity and justice stuff isn’t going to matter if we don’t solve climate change,” and we in the EJ movement say, “We don’t care if you all solve it if we get left behind again, right?” So you have to understand what our needs are. You have to understand that maybe the thing that I’m most focused on is helping my community not burn up every summer and, you know, all of our vulnerable folks just perish in their hot apartments and homes because they can’t pay for AC all summer. And that’s not going to immediately help your CO 2 issue, but that’s what we need to see happen right now.

In a world of finite federal resources, there is an inescapable conflict between the economic needs of poor and minority communities and the goals of reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Justice40 initiative attempts to obscure that conflict behind the fiction that the same programs can seamlessly address both concerns. Tejada is refreshingly honest in acknowledging that meeting EJ goals might require delaying the administration’s net-zero targets.

The public deserves an honest debate about how to strike a balance between social welfare and environmental concerns. The Justice40 initiative obscures the stark trade-offs involved in environmental policy. Instead, by muddling the distinctions between environmental and social programs, it gives progressive activists leeway to divert funding away from concrete environmental goals and shift it to vaguely defined social objectives. If the progressive wing of the Democratic Party wants to make the case that the country needs to massively expand social welfare programs, it is free to make that case to voters. But converting environmental and infrastructure programs into stealth wealth-transfer campaigns is undemocratic. It is also poor social policy, in that it attempts to empower poor communities through wildly roundabout and scattershot methods.

Biden’s muddled EJ agenda will make every environmental project more expensive and less effective. By miring infrastructure projects in endless permitting delays, it will thwart his administration’s aggressive emissions goals. And by making it harder for private industry to expand, it will limit job growth. All too predictably, those setbacks in economic opportunity will hit poor and minority communities the hardest. The next administration should roll back Biden’s ill-considered executive orders. The best way to fight local environmental problems is to measure where pollution is most severe and to focus on those regions first. The best way to fight climate change is to remove barriers to developing nuclear and other forms of clean energy infrastructure. An “everything-bagel” approach that attempts to solve all problems at once will wind up solving none of them.

Chairman Comer highlighted how sweeping executive orders and unchecked regulations issued by the Biden Administration have resulted in Americans paying higher prices, businesses struggling to make ends meet, and fewer economic opportunities in the marketplace. In addition, he noted that the Biden Administration targeted positive and necessary regulatory reforms implemented by the previous Administration. He stressed that this dramatic expansion of Executive Branch power has come at the expense of the American people. Chairman Comer concluded that Congress has a responsibility to address President Biden’s radical, costly, and burdensome agenda.

Below are Chairman Comer’s remarks as prepared for delivery.

Today’s hearing will shine a bright light on President Biden’s “whole-of-government” regulatory blitz that began on his first day in office.

From sweeping Executive Orders to massive, costly agency regulations, the Biden Administration has spared no expense when it comes to transforming America—much of which has been done without a clear delegation from Congress.

In just his first few days in office, President Biden issued far-reaching Executive Orders that radically altered how federal agencies approached climate issues.

The Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and several other agencies launched a government-wide effort to push out regulations to fundamentally change American life.

It is estimated that just three of the Biden Administration’s rules will cause $1.5 trillion to be spent over the next decade.

We know what that means for businesses and consumers: higher costs of doing business, higher prices, and fewer choices in the marketplace.

And we know that this overreach will only continue the expansion of Executive Branch power at the expense of the American people.

It didn’t have to be this way, and it wasn’t long ago that we were on the right track to limit federal regulatory excess that holds back economic prosperity.

The prior administration implemented substantial reforms to limit regulatory overreach, producing great economic success.

According to the 2020 Economic Report of the President, the Council of Economic Advisers estimated that regulatory reform was on track within 5 to 10 years to “raise[] real incomes by $3,100 per household per year by increasing choice, productivity, and competition.”

That’s over $3,000 more in the pocket of every household in America as a result of a smart approach to regulation.

Also according to that report, just twenty of the Trump Administration’s deregulatory actions were expected to save consumers and businesses about $220 billion per year after they went into full effect.

President Biden ran on being a “unifying” president, but instead he has used his platform to strip away those regulatory reforms we know were positively impacting the economy and replaced them with historic levels of new red tape.

The Biden Administration wasted no time eliminating deregulatory policies and instead cleared the way for President Biden’s radical, costly, and burdensome agenda.

The last thing any consumer or business wants to do is spend more time and more money on paperwork. That’s something on which we can all agree.

With historically high inflation, most consumers and businesses simply don’t have extra cash laying around to pay someone to fill out reams more paperwork for them.

Fortunately, Republicans in Congress know what a thoughtful, efficient, and results-driven regulatory system looks like, and that’s what I and my colleagues in this Republican majority are here to support.

This Committee and this House Majority will continue to hold the Biden Administration accountable for its extreme regulatory overreach and pursue legislative solutions to ensure commonsense regulatory reform.

When America isn’t tied down with red tape, or buried under heaps of federal paperwork, America’s small businesses, workers and communities are capable of soaring to new heights of prosperity.

And with more economic prosperity comes more economic opportunities. And these opportunities will do more to help Americans create, innovate, and thrive then any regulation pushed through by unelected bureaucrats.

We saw this during the previous Administration and the results speak for themselves.

I thank the witnesses for being here today to testify.

And with that, I yield to Ranking Member Raskin for his opening statement.

392,Opinion | Why Americans still don't like Biden's economy - The Washington Post,Opinion | Why Americans still don't like Biden's economy  The Washington Post,"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDIzLzEwLzI3L3doeS1hbWVyaWNhbnMtdW5oYXBweS1iaWRlbi1lY29ub215L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"The economy expanded at a nearly 5 percent annual rate during the most recent quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Economic growth is strong, unemployment is low, and inflation is falling. Yet people are still unhappy about the economy. Gallup’s latest numbers show only 20 percent of Americans consider the economy excellent or good, while 48 percent consider it poor.

People have tried to explain the apparent disconnect, theorizing that it’s because of misleading media “narratives” about the economy, Republican voters’ partisanship, free-floating “grumpiness” or a public desire to see prices actually fall.

The truth might be simpler: Wages haven’t kept up with prices. Average wages are down in real terms — adjusted, that is, for inflation — since President Biden took office. They are roughly 3 percent lower than their peak in April 2020.

Advertisement

That’s partly because real wages spiked early in the pandemic for the worst reason: Low-wage workers lost their jobs. But even when you compare wages today with the pre-pandemic trend, they are still about 2 percent lower than people had reason to expect. That’s what this graph, constructed with data provided by my American Enterprise Institute colleague Michael Strain, shows.

If that is what is weighing down public perceptions of the economy, there’s ample precedent for it. Unemployment and inflation were low in 2005 and 2006, and supporters of President George W. Bush wondered why few Americans considered the economy good or excellent. Real wages, though, were stagnating. Something similar happened under President Barack Obama. For much of his presidency, inflation was low, the economy grew, and unemployment fell. But wages were also stagnant for much of his time in office, and people rated the economy poorly.

During the past 30 years, there have been only two periods when Gallup found that most Americans considered the economy good: from late 1997 through early 2001, and from mid-2018 through March 2020. Though unemployment was falling and inflation was low in both eras, that doesn’t distinguish them from other times when the public was unsatisfied with the economy. What sets the two happy periods apart is that real wages were rising to new peaks.

The pattern strongly suggests that Americans will not consider the economy to be performing well unless their paychecks rise faster than their bills. Beyond that, the data leave some questions unanswered. It might be that the public would be satisfied with inflation at its current level if wages were rising faster. Inflation over the course of the year 2000 was roughly as high as it has been in recent months, and people didn’t seem to mind.

On the other hand, Americans might be having a stronger negative reaction to today’s inflation because of its context: a multiyear uptick after decades when it was, for the most part, low. Even real wage growth, then, might not be enough to diminish our displeasure from sticker shock. Inflation is falling but still high compared to our recent experience (and to the Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate). So prices are high — the gap between the price level and its pre-pandemic path keeps increasing — and rising faster than normal. It might not be much comfort to consumers that the second derivative of prices is negative — which is what it means to say that inflation is falling.

She dipped into her emergency savings this year. And she doesn't believe President Joe Biden feels her pain.

The retired teacher from Channelview, Texas, worries about paying $4 for cereal and $3.38 for gasoline in her state.

""According to him, everything’s perfect,"" said Muñoz, a Republican. ""He just doesn't live in reality.""

As Biden tries to sell Americans on an economic rebound, most Americans aren't buying it, according to an exclusive poll from the Suffolk University Sawyer Business School and USA TODAY that reveals major concerns about the state of the economy and little hope of people's outlook improving. What's worse for the incumbent president, Americans say they trust Donald Trump − not Biden − to fix it.

Save, splurge, (don't) stress:How Gen Z is putting their spin on personal finances

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

Groceries. Housing. Gas. All of these are pushing people further and further into debt, they say.

Nearly 70% of Americans said the economy is getting worse, according to the poll, while only 22% said the economy is improving. Eighty-four percent of Americans said their cost of living is rising, and nearly half of Americans, 49%, blamed food and grocery prices as the main driver.

""It's getting harder to survive out there with the little bit of money that we do make,"" said Casey Lafi, 43, a waitress at a diner in Philadelphia who lives with her husband, a veteran who is disabled, and a 15-year-old daughter.

Lafi, who voted for Biden in 2020, said her family's food budget has skyrocketed from $800 to $1,500 a month. ""Eggs are ridiculous,"" she said, also singling out prices for fruit, vegetables and milk.

For months, Biden has touted ""Bidenomics"" to frame an economic agenda centered on the middle class. He has highlighted his efforts to expand domestic manufacturing, push through historic infrastructure spending and work with Democrats in Congress to cap the price of insulin and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower costs for prescription drugs.

The White House has tried to get credit for an unemployment rate that's near a 50-year-low, a robust job market, including 13.5 million jobs added under the Biden presidency, and annual inflation that, according to the Consumer Price Index, is down to 3.7% from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.

Yet only 34% of Americans said they approve of Biden's handling of the economy, compared with 59% who disapprove, according to the poll.

""Food prices are going up. The rental prices are sky-high. The fuel goes up and down like a yo-yo,"" said Javier Torres, 65, of Pembroke Pines, Florida, who is unsure he will vote for Biden in 2024 like he did in 2020.

""It's been pretty bad, and I was a supporter of Biden, so I don't know what's going on,"" said Torres, who is married with three children and manages a warehouse and logistics company in South Florida. ""Maybe it's not all his fault − or it is? I don't know. But something's got to give.""

More Americans trust Trump than Biden on economy

The poll, a survey of 1,000 U.S. adults by mobile and landline phones from Sept. 6 - 11, has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Interviews of poll respondents by USA TODAY underscored a nation deeply worried about the economic future.

Americans' anxieties present a major challenge to Biden's reelection bid. Although Democrats overcame similar concerns over inflation to exceed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, the economy is typically a defining issue in presidential races.

More Americans said they trust Trump, the 2024 Republican primary front-runner, than Biden to improve the economy by a 47%-36% margin. The spread is 46%-26% in Trump's favor among independent voters.

Nearly all Republicans surveyed expressed pessimism about the economy, according to the poll: 96% said it is getting worse, not better. But 76% of independents and even 34% of Democrats also said the economy is getting worse.

""Things are more precarious than they've ever been, at least in my lifetime,"" said Roshaun Harris, 38, a social justice and environmental activist from Detroit whose rent for his townhome has nearly doubled from $900 to $1,650 a month.

A disconnect between 'Bidenomics' and Americans' economic fears

Directly below food prices as the main financial toll on families, 16% of Americans said housing costs are the biggest contributor to their rising costs of living, followed by utility bills and gas prices, each cited by 11% of Americans.

The poll's findings expose a major disconnect between the way Biden describes the economy and how a majority of Americans feel about it.

""We’re replacing trickle-down economics with what everyone on Wall Street is referring to these days as 'Bidenomics,'"" Biden said in remarks on Labor Day in Philadelphia. ""And guess what? It's working.""

But 74% of Americans described the economy negatively in one word − either ""horrible/terrible,” “bad/poor,” “struggling” or “chaotic” − compared with 18% who said the economy is ""excellent/good” or ""growing/improving."" Another 4% said the economy is “fair/average.”

Dan McKinnon, of Ludington, Michigan, who owns an assisted living and home care company, said recent pay increases he has awarded his 50 employees have failed to keep up with their cost of living.

""With the cost of housing and food and everything, they just can't make it,"" McKinnon said, describing a ""suffocating"" economy for his workers and seniors who are having trouble affording his services.

Jared Bernstein, chair of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers in the Biden administration, defended the president's economic record by pointing to Americans' overwhelming support, according to polling, for capping insulin prices, lowering prescription drug prices and providing tax incentives to create manufacturing jobs.

""These are the components of Bidenomics,"" Bernstein said in an interview this month on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""So when someone tells you Americans don't like Bidenomics, it's false. Americans approve of the components above 80%.""

Americans say they're cutting back

But Biden's policies haven't erased economic fears, and Americans say they have changed their spending habits. Seventy-one percent of poll respondents said they are eating out less; 68% said they are cutting back spending on clothes; 53% said they are spending less on groceries; and 57% said they are putting off home improvements.

Bobbie McGee, a self-employed sign language interpreter from Auburn, Washington, counts herself lucky that the rent on the home she shares with her husband and two dogs has been stable.

Still, she has adjusted her spending, especially on food. McGee, 70, said she looks for what’s on sale and buys in bulk.

And because she travels for work, McGee keeps a close eye on the price of gas. She’s not traveling as far as she used to. The only jobs she takes that require long drives are from a company willing to pay for her travel time instead of just mileage.

Low-income families earning less than $50,000 a year were significantly more likely to say they plan to cut back than earners of more than $100,000.

""We have all these government statistics pointing to a different story than what people are telling us and the polling,"" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, who led the poll. ""It's vastly different and it poses an immense challenge to Biden as president.""

But Garry Hurley Jr., a software developer from New Cumberland, Pennsylvania, puts more blame on Republicans for his economic struggles.

Hurley, who is still paying off student loans, had been looking forward to having $20,000 of his debt erased by Biden’s student debt forgiveness plan. But the Supreme Court’s conservative majority blocked the plan, which was challenged by six conservative states and two individual borrowers.

“It’s putting a crimp in my bank account to try and support my family with also paying the student loans and my mortgage payment and everything else,” he said.

The economy would be better, the Democrat said, “if Republicans kept their nose out of my wallet.”

But Brian Oestrick, a truck driver from Knoxville, Tennessee, who believes the economy would be better if Trump were still president, doesn’t see any signs of improvement.

“It’s going to get a lot worse,"" he said, ""before it gets better.""

In the past year, he has signed into law several major pieces of legislation, retained control of the Senate, presided over an economy that added five million jobs, led a coalition in support of Ukraine, and, just last week, ordered the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon. But the heart of Biden’s speech will likely focus on his economic agenda, the core of which is an ambitious industrial policy designed to strengthen manufacturing, hasten a green energy transformation, create well-paid jobs, and insure American technological leadership over China.

In large part, the policy consists of federal tax credits, government grant programs, and infrastructure projects that were enacted in three landmark bills during Biden’s first two years in office. Last year’s Inflation Reduction Act contained about four hundred billion dollars in green-energy spending, including tax credits for green-energy producers and purchasers of electric vehicles. The CHIPS and Science Act, which Congress passed in August, provided more than fifty billion dollars to encourage manufacturers of semiconductors to build factories in the United States, and pledged about a hundred and seventy billion for research into technologies of the future. These two pieces of legislation built upon the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which Biden signed into law in November, 2021, and which was posited on the unchallengeable notion that it isn’t possible to build a twenty-first-century economy on dilapidated transport links and public utilities.

Spread out over many years of spending, and relative to a G.D.P. of $26.13 trillion, the sums involved in the Biden strategy aren’t as big as they seem. But, relative to recent U.S. economic policy, the spending certainly represents a sharp break from the past. “It isn’t quite the arrival of a New Deal; it’s not like we’ve created all these new agencies,” Felicia Wong, the president of the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, told me. “But it is a new way of using the government in a multipronged and muscular manner to shape, prod, and mobilize the economy in certain directions.” Pointing to the efforts to promote green energy and high-tech manufacturing, as well as efforts to locate new plants in parts of the country that have lost manufacturing jobs, Wong went on, “They are trying to shape markets, ultimately.”

In its broad scope and government interventionism, the Biden policy has some antecedents: F.D.R.’s rural-electrification initiatives, including the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority; the use of the Pentagon research budget by Republican and Democratic Presidents to foster scientific research, especially in microelectronics; and debates inside the Democratic Party regarding strategic trade policy in the nineteen-eighties and nineties. But, when I asked Brian Deese, the head of the White House’s National Economic Council, about the origins of the Biden industrial policy, he went back even further—to Alexander Hamilton’s 1791 “Report on Manufactures,” which called for the creation of a vibrant industrial sector. “This has been a conversation for all of the American experiment,” Deese noted.

Hamilton lived in an era when the United States was largely agricultural and rival politicians like Thomas Jefferson had a vision of the country as a mosaic of rural homesteads. Hamilton argued that industrialization was essential on economic and national-security grounds. He said that building up domestic industry would “render the United States, independent of foreign nations for military, and other essential supplies.” And, he argued, relying solely on private enterprise wouldn’t get the job done. The effort would need “the incitement and patronage of government,” by which he meant “bounties” (subsidies) for domestic industry and tariffs to protect it from foreign competition.

The Biden Administration insists that it isn’t protectionist (more on that below), but it is making an argument similar to Hamilton’s about the need to build up American manufacturing capacity, in areas like semiconductors and batteries for electric vehicles. Administration officials point to three factors that have influenced their thinking: the rise of China, and the extent to which it has used non-market practices to strengthen its competitive position in key economic areas; the coronavirus pandemic, which illustrated the supply-chain vulnerabilities that the U.S. economy faces after decades of offshoring; and intensifying climate change, which necessitates a rapid transformation of energy production and transportation. “All of these themes connect to issues that have long been debated, but there is a new approach that I think reflects the new realities of the economy,” Deese told me.

Another factor pushing the Biden Administration in this direction is the political success that Donald Trump enjoyed with his bellicose economic nationalism. The White House has left some of Trump’s tariffs in place, and it has gone far beyond him in tax and spending policies designed to promote the growth of green and high-tech manufacturing, particularly in the Rust Belt. Biden’s industrial strategy was largely developed during the 2020 campaign, and Democrats hope that it will actually deliver what Trump promised.

Like many big, bold ventures, the new approach has attracted criticism. European officials complain that the Biden plan, which limits tax credits to electronic vehicles assembled in the United States, violates U.S. commitments not to subsidize domestic industries or discriminate against foreign ones. In December, Emmanuel Macron, the French President, warned that enacting the Inflation Reduction Act could “fragment the West.” In response, Biden suggested that some “tweaks” could be made to meet European concerns. Deese argued that the dispute needs to be placed in a larger context. “The Inflation Reduction Act is unapologetically focused on building American green energy capacity so the United States can meet its climate goals—a policy position the Europeans have long championed as well,” he wrote. “The world is so short of zero carbon energy production and zero carbon transportation options that what we all need is for the United States and Europe to build capacity at a very rapid clip.”

The other major criticism of Biden’s industrial policy, which largely comes from the right, is that it is unlikely to work. “In case after case, industrial policy plans sound good on paper and generate impressive results in various academic models,” Scott Lincicome, the director of economic studies at the pro-free-market Cato Institute, wrote in an article last month. “But they are ultimately distorted by politics, bureaucratic inertia (or incompetence), pre-​existing policies, private or public resistance, or unanticipated market developments.” To offer an example, Lincicome pointed to new Treasury guidance that suggests that foreign-built electric vehicles will qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act’s new seventy-five-hundred-dollar subsidy if they are leased rather than purchased. In addition to hurting domestic carmakers, this provision “could encourage Americans to buy or lease bigger, heavier, and more expensive vehicles, raising safety and environmental problems,” Lincicome wrote.

Actually, the history of industrial policy is more two-sided than Lincicome suggests. From the rapid rise of U.S. manufacturing during the nineteenth century, which was facilitated by protectionist tariffs and large public investments in education and infrastructure, to the emergence of Silicon Valley, which successfully exploited basic technologies developed by the Pentagon (including the Internet), the federal government has long played an important role in fostering U.S. economic development. But Administration officials and other supporters of the Biden plan are well aware that it is ambitious and complicated, and that implementing it successfully represents a big challenge."

The resiliency of the US economy is defying expectations — and the odds of a “soft landing” are improving, said Lael Brainard, President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser, on Wednesday afternoon.

New data from the Labor Department released earlier in the day showed that inflation rose last month by 3%, its slowest pace since March 2021. The news pushed markets higher, and Biden touted it as “Bidenomics in action.”

“The US is defying expectations that inflation wouldn’t fall absent significant job destruction,” said Brainard, head of the National Economic Council, in a speech at the Economic Club of New York. “Just today, we saw new and encouraging evidence that the US economy is on the path to moderate inflation accompanied by a resilient job market.”

The strength of the US job market has been “a surprise to so many forecasters who really didn’t see that [there would be a] rebound in participation,” she said.

The latest jobs report showed that 209,000 jobs were added in June, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.6%, a historic low.

“We’ve seen these repeated predictions that recession is right around the corner — and the data have instead delivered continued resilience in the economy,” said Brainard, formerly No. 2 at the Federal Reserve.

Bidenomics

Brainard said that much of this economic strength is due to Bidenomics. That’s the president’s economic theory that rejects the idea of “trickle-down” policies in favor of focusing on the middle class. Bidenomics will be a centerpiece of Biden’s 2024 reelection campaign.

“This economy is delivering strong results for America’s middle class — creating good jobs and yielding real income gains, especially for workers whose earnings have too often not kept up. These economic gains did not happen by chance, and they will not be sustained absent a deliberate strategy,” she said. “President Biden’s economic strategy aims to grow the economy from the middle out and bottom up — not the top down.”"

But the world has changed since Biden visited a familiar place to talk up familiar topics.

The war between Israel and Hamas has scrambled geopolitics and potentially reshuffled a 2024 presidential race beginning to heat up. Getting the public’s attention could be a tall order given the focus on fighting and atrocities in Gaza, and the Americans among those killed by Hamas.

The president started his speech Friday talking about the conflict, telling the crowd that he had spoken by video conference for an hour or so with the families of 14 Americans missing in the attacks.

“The more we learned about the attack the more horrifying it becomes,” Biden said.

Other domestic matters also are competing for political attention, with the fight over choosing the next Republican House speaker potentially imperiling continued U.S. aid to Ukraine, and a United Auto Workers strike entering its fifth week. On top of all that, the president’s son, Hunter, is facing federal gun charges and Biden himself recently sat for interviews with a special prosecutor investigating his handling of classified documents — though that may signal the case is nearing a conclusion.

But Biden still made his case at the marine terminal in Philadelphia, where he declared it was one of seven regional hubs selected around the country to produce and deliver hydrogen fuel that can run factories and other facilities, as well as key components of heavy industry, to limit greenhouse gas emissions. A centerpiece of the Biden administration’s clean energy plan, the hubs will be paid for using $7 billion from the sweeping infrastructure package that cleared Congress in 2021.

“These hubs are about people coming together across state lines, across industries, across political parties to build a stronger, more sustainable economy and to rebuild our communities,” he said.

Any struggle to shift attention to Biden’s domestic agenda highlights larger questions about the president’s overall reelection strategy and whether messaging primarily built around the president’s policy accomplishments and ability to govern can compete with ever-changing world events that shake up politics in real time.

“Will the country care? In the political class, in the news-absorbing part of the population, nationally? No,” Cathal Nolan, director of the International History Institute at Boston University and the author of several books on diplomatic and military history, said of Biden’s hydrogen production announcement.

“But I don’t think that’s what infrastructure speeches are about, ever,” Nolan added. “I think it’s about the local impact.”

Indeed, allies contend Biden should stay on political message as he seeks reelection, stressing steady leadership approaches even in a time of crisis, and highlighting how the government is improving middle-class lives as he heads into a potential rematch with Donald Trump, who has a commanding lead in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.

The Philadelphia speech was part of what his administration is calling the third installment of Biden’s Investing in America Tour, which will see the president, Vice President Kamala Harris and key Cabinet members travel the country to promote economic policies. Biden heads to Colorado on Monday.

“When there’s an international crisis, you’ve got to be leading,” said Joel Rubin, who was an Obama administration State Department official and a veteran of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. “The fact that he’s going to continue to be out there demonstrates leadership.”

Friday’s trip notwithstanding, Biden has made the situation in Gaza a priority, speaking frequently with his foreign advisers and with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He met with Jewish community leaders at the White House this week and has said that “the U.S. has Israel’s back” while decrying the “sheer evil” of Islamic militants.

“We’re making sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself and respond to these attacks, he said. ”It’s also a priority for me to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

The president also announced other policy efforts this week, including announcing more attempts to curb “ junk fees,” and meeting with CEOs.

Rubin said the Biden administration has championed a “foreign policy for the middle class,” which emphasizes domestic economic and industrial strength and reinvigorating global alliances. That helps explain the thought process behind Friday’s speech, he said.

“Communicating why his policy is working for the American people economically … that undergirds American national power overseas. You take that away, you have nothing,” said Rubin, who also founded J Street, a liberal Jewish advocacy group in Washington, and is running for Congress in Maryland.

Biden on Friday insisted the clean energy investment in was an investment in the future – one of several initiated by his administration.

“I truly believe this country is about to take off, for the first time in a long time we’re actually investing in America,” he said.

Still, selling Biden’s economic agenda to voters wasn’t easy even before the outbreak of war in Gaza. Just 36% of U.S. adults approved of Biden’s handling of the economy in August, slightly lower than the 42% who approved of his overall performance, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Whatever the message, the president can help himself politically by staying focused on Pennsylvania, said longtime Democratic strategist Robert Shrum.

“If he wins the state he’s very likely to win reelection,” Shrum said. “So they can do the event in Philadelphia and get a lot of attention for it.”

Biden appears to be betting on that strategy, heaping Pennsylvania with attention that has included a visit per month recently — acutely aware that it is one of a few toss-up states where outcomes can really sway the election, along with Georgia and Arizona, as well as perhaps Wisconsin and Michigan.

Since formally announcing his reelection bid in April, Biden addressed some of the nation’s largest unions at the Philadelphia convention center after they jointly endorsed him in June, the only 2024 campaign rally he’s held so far. He returned to Philadelphia in July, visiting a shipyard where he talked up how organized labor would lead a major push toward embracing green energy.

He made an August trip for a funeral to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he was born, and was in Philadelphia last month for an ALF-CIO Labor Day event.

“It’s the power of incumbency that he can work policy speeches into places that he’s going to,” said Mustafa Rashed, a Philadelphia-based Democratic strategist. “Everything is about 2024 at this point.”"

National

West Long Branch, NJ – President Joe Biden gets mediocre to poor marks on key aspects of the economy despite him recently touting what he calls “Bidenomics.” Only 3 in 10 Americans feel the country is doing a better job recovering economically than the rest of the world since the pandemic. The latest Monmouth (“Mon-muth”) University Poll also finds Congress and nearly all of its leadership continue to earn negative ratings.

Biden earns a split decision on his handling of jobs and unemployment (47% approve and 48% disapprove). He gets a net negative rating for his handling of transportation and energy infrastructure (43% approve and 51% disapprove) and an even worse rating for his handling of inflation (34% approve and 62% disapprove). More than 7 in 10 Democrats give the president positive marks on these policy areas and more than 8 in 10 Republicans rate him negatively. Approval among independents stands at 41% for jobs and unemployment, 37% for transportation and energy infrastructure, and just 26% for inflation. These results are similar to Biden’s ratings for these three policy areas in a Monmouth poll taken last September.

“The president has been touting ‘Bidenomics,’ but the needle of public opinion has not really moved. Americans are just not giving him a lot of credit when it comes to the economy,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

Some indicators suggest the U.S. economy has been recovering better than other countries from the worldwide instability and rising prices brought on by the Covid pandemic. However, just 30% of the American public believes that. In fact, 32% say the U.S. economy’s recovery from this situation is worse than other countries and another 33% say the U.S. recovery is about the same as the rest of the world.

The Monmouth University Poll finds Biden’s overall job performance rating currently stands at 44% approve and 52% disapprove. His approval number is three points higher than it has been over the past few months, but his overall rating is statistically in line with where it has been since last autumn. Just 25% of the public says the country is going in the right direction, while 68% say it is on the wrong track.

In other poll findings, Vice President Kamala Harris receives a job rating of 40% approve and 52% disapprove. These numbers have not moved much since Monmouth started polling the vice president’s job performance earlier this year. Opinion of the job the U.S. Congress is doing stands at 22% approve and 68% disapprove, which is basically in line with poll findings since last autumn.

The poll also asked about the performance of congressional leadership. Only House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries receives a net positive score from the American public (24% approve and 18% disapprove), but only 4 in 10 know enough about him to register an opinion. The other three top leaders are rated by 6 in 10 Americans, with Jeffries’ fellow Democrat in the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (25% approve and 37% disapprove), and his Republican counterpart in the House, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (23% approve and 39% disapprove), earning similar, albeit negative, ratings. McCarthy has become better known since taking the Speaker’s gavel in January, but his net rating is basically unchanged because both his approve and disapprove numbers have increased. The public’s lowest leader ratings are reserved for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (12% approve and 50% disapprove). As a whole, Democrats tend to be more positive about their party’s leadership than Republicans are about their own congressional leaders.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from July 12 to 17, 2023 with 910 adults in the United States. The question results in this release have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points for the full sample. The poll was conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, NJ.

Methodology

The Monmouth University Poll was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from July 12 to 17, 2023 with a probability-based national random sample of 910 adults age 18 and older. Interviews were conducted in English, and included 319 live landline telephone interviews, 480 live cell phone interviews, and 111 online surveys via a cell phone text invitation. Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of random digit dialing and list-based sampling. Landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter youngest adult household screen. Interviewing services were provided by Braun Research, with sample obtained from Dynata (RDD, n= 569), Aristotle (list, n= 136) and a panel of prior Monmouth poll participants (n= 205). Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on US Census information (ACS 2021 one-year survey). For results based on this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points adjusted for sample design effects (1.52). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.

President Joe Biden ran for office during the “first female recession,” when the pandemic walloped women’s economic prospects much more than men’s. Women in and out of the workforce were burdened by extra caregiving responsibilities. Biden promised to get things back on track — especially for women of color, who were hardest hit by the pandemic — and to restore a sense of normalcy in their lives.

Since he took office, women’s employment has rebounded amid a historic low overall unemployment rate. Labor force participation among women aged 25 to 54 has fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and a significant number of women with children under 18 have reentered the workforce.

Biden and his team tout these improvements, some of which were in motion before he took office, saying they have fulfilled the campaign promise. They also point to the passage of several landmark economic investment packages and workplace protections for women and parents. The past two years have also seen a broader, but still unfulfilled, push for wage equality, paid leave and child care — moves highly popular with the public that face significant roadblocks in Congress.

As Biden launches a campaign for a second term, he’ll have to educate voters about what he’s done — and convince them that he’s the one who can finish the job when it comes to long-neglected policy goals important to women and families.

The challenge, as described by people who back the president, is multifaceted: Many temporary programs benefiting women and families, like the expanded child tax credit, have expired or are set to expire later this year. Efforts to pass more permanent investments in paid leave and child care stalled out in the Senate. And despite Democrats’ better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterms, many voters don’t know what the Biden administration has passed.

Energizing women voters, who tend to be more Democratic than men, is core to Biden’s chances of winning. Groups that back him, like the nonprofit Building Back Together, have been working to pitch women voters on these accomplishments even before his reelection bid is announced.

“Fundamentally, all of the legislation has an economic narrative that we have an incredible opportunity to tell,” said Mayra Macías, interim executive director of Building Back Together. “… It is so important to show these concrete examples of people who are already feeling the impacts and are able to tell their story.”

The economy isn’t the only way gender will impact the 2024 election. Abortion access, which boosted Democrats to victory in many 2022 races, is poised to play a major role again in 2024. But the White House and Biden’s allies are also laser-focused on promoting Biden’s economic achievements, especially as they relate to women, and are preparing to spend considerable resources communicating them to voters.

What Biden has done

Biden’s investments in the economy started soon after he took office in January 2021, following two major economic stimulus packages passed in 2020 under then-President Donald Trump.

The American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion relief package Congress passed in March 2021, sent direct payments to millions of Americans and “stemmed the freefall of the child care sector” with a lifeline of subsidies, said Melissa Boteach, vice president for economic security and child care/early learning at the National Women’s Law Center. It also expanded the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in half while it was in effect, broadened other tax credits for families, bolstered nutrition assistance and lowered health care premiums.

The bill “made a huge difference” for women and families in need, Boteach said, but the relief measures, many of which are temporary and since expired, were “never designed to address the underlying problems that COVID laid bare.”

In 2021 and 2022, the White House, working with a narrowly divided Senate, got through a trifecta of bills that aimed to cut costs for Americans and create more job openings for more women in industries long dominated by men: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the party-line Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

“I think that we’re at a transformational moment for women, especially women in the workplace,” said Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates. “And I think a lot of that has to do with how the Biden administration has prioritized that in the past few years.”

Several other pieces of legislation were designed to help women stay in the workforce and be treated fairly. In 2022, Biden signed into law several bipartisan bills aimed at combatting gender-based violence and workplace harassment, including a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). In addition, the December government funding bill included more federal funds for child care block grants, VAWA programs, maternal health research and workplace protections for pregnant and breastfeeding workers.

And after the IRA capped out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 per month for Medicare recipients, three major drug companies announced they would lower insulin costs for all patients. Reducing drug costs is particularly significant for women, who make an estimated 80 percent of the health care decisions for their families and spend more on health care than men on average.

“There’s really no more important issue than your family’s health and your health care — this has been one of the most important issues that we’ve seen over the past decade-plus,” said Danielle Deiseroth, interim executive director of left-leaning pollster Data For Progress. “They should take a victory lap, because government delivering on tangible wins that impact folks’ everyday lives is almost unheard of in the modern political era.”

Macías also pointed to Small Business Administration leader Isabel Guzman’s focus on empowering women small-business owners, and guidelines from the Department of Commerce, led by Secretary Gina Raimondo, requiring companies seeking over $150 million in CHIPS funds to provide employee child care.

LGBTQ+ people also benefited economically from Biden’s orders, which included requiring federal agencies to fully enforce the employment protections for LGBTQ+ people that the Supreme Court granted in a landmark 2020 ruling, a break from the Trump administration, and directed the federal government to ensure LGBTQ+ equity across various agencies and programs.

“Those agencies have taken, in this administration, an explicit commitment to look at the impacts on LGBTQ people,” said Elana Redfield, federal policy director at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School. “Whether it’s economic development, meeting basic survival needs through services like SNAP and [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families] or in job creation, they’re all using a lens that wasn’t there before.”

The test for 2024

Conversations with over a dozen Democratic strategists, pollsters and gender policy advocates portray both a steep messaging test and an opportunity to show what Biden allies describe as transformative investments in the economy and commitments to bolstering gender equity under his tenure.

“I think he’s one of the most accomplished presidents out there. It would have been easier if he’d only gotten a couple of things done, because then voters would have known what it was,” said top Democratic pollster and Lake Research Partners president Celinda Lake. “The sheer volume has increased the difficulty of the communication task way more than I think any of us envisioned.”

The lead official tasked with this messaging is poised to be Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a senior White House adviser and longtime Democratic strategist Biden tapped to manage his reelection campaign.

A poll from moderate think tank Third Way and Impact Research in the summer of 2022 found that just 24 percent of voters knew that Congress had passed a significant $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill months earlier. Another survey from Data For Progress fielded shortly before the midterms found that less than half of voters surveyed knew about the prescription drug price decreases in the IRA, which start going into effect in 2023, and even fewer knew of the bill’s other provisions or had seen advertising related to the bill.

A post-midterm survey of voters in eight battleground states from the Democratic group Way To Win found that 78 percent of voters and 76 percent of women couldn’t name anything Biden had done that had directly benefited their lives. Voters who named the economy as their most important issue reported voting for Republicans by over 30 points in the survey, revealing a “major vulnerability” for Democrats in 2024, the poll memo concluded. “It is simply unsustainable,” the memo said, “to lose this badly on the most important issue to voters.”

“In some ways, it mirrors the overall story of President Biden,” said Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, Way to Win’s vice president and chief strategy officer. “He’s done more than any administration in modern history, but there’s just still much more to do. And for women, economic concerns are just not relegated to the kitchen table.”

The pro-Biden super PAC Unite The Country is gearing up to mount an ad blitz on Biden’s economic agenda targeting the Midwest. Amanda Loveday, a senior adviser to the group, said the PAC is “purely going to be spending our money in the Rust Belt talking to voters and women across Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.”

“I do think that voters forget why they can afford more, or why they have such a good-paying job or why their insulin is cheaper,” Loveday said. “It’s our job to ensure that they know it was Joe Biden.”

What got left out

The recovery from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic was an “uneven” one for women, families and particularly women of color, said Boteach of the National Women’s Law Center.

Significant economic investments in infrastructure, job creation and climate resiliency came at the expense of equally ambitious economic investments in families and caregivers. Landmark investments in child care and a federal paid leave program fell out of Biden’s initial Build Back Better proposal and didn’t make it into the IRA. And Congress let the expanded child tax credit expire at the end of 2021.

“The climate legislation and infrastructure will benefit everybody, including many women,” Boteach said. “But it was disappointing that at the end of the day, the care economy pieces fell out of the reconciliation bill.”

The fall of Roe v. Wade, and the slew of abortion bans that followed, also dealt a critical blow to gender equity efforts both within and outside the White House. However, advocates argue that in addition to using the tools at his disposal to shore up abortion rights, Biden has an opportunity in 2024 to harness continued anger to promote highly popular but incomplete elements of his agenda, including child care and paid leave.

Dawn Huckelbridge, director at Paid Leave for All Action, pointed to a September survey of likely battleground voters conducted with the Global Strategy Group that found 81 percent of voters polled supported federal paid family and medical leave — an 11-point increase from November 2021, before Roe fell.

Voters energized by abortion rights, she argued, “are also voters who care about paid leave.”

“Finishing the job” left undone by Congress is emerging as a critical theme of Biden’s expected reelection bid. Biden called on Congress to pass paid leave, allocate billions in funding for child care and reinstate the expanded child tax credit in both his State of the Union address in February and his budget proposal.

“That was probably the best I’ve seen Biden talk since the campaign,” Deiseroth said of the State of the Union. Emphasizing “tangible benefits for voters” from lowering health care costs and tackling junk fees, she argued, creates a stark contrast between Biden and “Republicans spinning up an apocalyptic version of America.”

But with Congress divided, Biden finds himself in opposition to a Republican-controlled House of Representatives advocating cuts to federal spending and taking aim at the legislation passed in the two years of his presidency. Republican messaging in 2024 will likely again center the economy and the cost of living — issues paramount to women and women of color.

“Women can’t afford Biden’s America,” Emma Vaughn, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. “While Biden doubles down on his radical agenda that leaves women behind, Republicans will continue to champion women and focus on issues that matter most to American women.”

Fernandez Ancona said a Biden win will require a broad coalition capturing not only independent and swing voters but also “surge voters” who don’t regularly turn out to vote in presidential races. Women of color, she added, “are an incredibly important constituency” in that coalition.

‘An end to the chaos’

Biden proved in the 2022 midterms that “people really underestimated him,” Lake said. He and his party, she argued, turned a midterm election that voters typically approach as a referendum over the sitting president into a sharp contrast between Biden’s leadership and what they cast as Republican extremism on abortion and democracy.

“2024 has to be, again, a choice,” said Lake, one of the leading pollsters for Biden’s 2020 campaign. “The choice is very dramatic, including on work and family issues, and on abortion. It couldn’t be starker.”

And women voters, who make up a majority of the electorate, “are the key swing audience for both parties” in 2024, she said.

“As Democrats, we have to win women by more than Republicans win men, and for Republicans, they’re trying to cut their losses among women,” she added. “Women are going to be the battleground in 2024.”

A bipartisan survey conducted in December by Lake Research Partners and the Tarrance Group found that Hispanic women, a key swing demographic heavily courted by both parties in recent elections, showed “off the charts” support for many of the economic policies in Biden’s agenda, Lake noted.

“The percentage of women of color who are with Democrats on every issue that we’re trying to put forward is so much higher,” Fernandez Ancona said. “The biggest thing is not overlooking that they’re an important part of the electorate, and what they care about matters.”

Biden won in 2020 by arguing that he would return to normalcy and restore stability after the tumult of the pandemic and the chaos of the Trump years. And Lake said that message should also underlie his reelection pitch.

“As one millennial woman said in our focus groups, ‘Why is everything in this country a dumpster fire?’” Lake said. “And she’s right. People, and women in particular, really want an end to the chaos. They want stable leadership, they want a steady hand. And that is an enormous strength of Joe Biden’s.”"

Unemployment is low, inflation is significantly down from its 2022 peak (if sticky and ticking up in the last month), wages are up, the stock market is hitting new all-time highs, and it looks like the Federal Reserve might be able to keep the US out of a recession.

Surveys are beginning to capture growing consumer confidence — but for President Joe Biden, the question is whether it’s rising quickly enough for him to avoid being penalized in the 2024 election.

He had no control over the pandemic-rattled economy he inherited, but voters may nevertheless blame him for it, as they have (rightly or wrongly) blamed their presidents for the country’s economic troubles in the past.

Voters have mentioned economic issues (think: inflation, jobs, and more) as their greatest concern since 2022 in a long-running and ongoing Gallup survey. Another February Morning Consult/Bloomberg survey of voters in swing states also found that the economy is the most important issue — and could therefore decide the outcome of the election.

Recent polls show Trump with an 11- to 20-point edge over Biden on which candidate would better handle the economy. In some ways, this isn’t a surprise: The economy was generally good under Trump, except for the Covid-induced recession; under Biden, high inflation has been the biggest economic story. If Biden is to turn his fortunes around, he’ll have to convince the American public that the economy is in fact better than it feels and will continue to improve — and that it’s better than they remember under Trump.

“The fundamental problem for Biden and the Democrats is that while the rate of inflation is down, it’s not going backwards,” GOP pollster Whit Ayres said. “It’s hard to persuade people that things are better.”

Americans think the economy is worse under Biden

Americans have been stubbornly downbeat about the economy under Biden, with Gallup’s Economic Confidence Index hovering between -20 and -40 for months on a scale of -100 to 100.

That number is derived from monthly surveys of US adults in which they are asked to rate national economic conditions, with 100 signifying that all respondents “say the economy is excellent or good and that it is getting better” and -100 signifying that they all “say it is poor and getting worse,” according to Gallup.

The data suggests that the more economic confidence has plummeted, the more the economy has become an issue in the presidential race. About 30 percent of Americans cited the economy as the most important problem facing the country in the most recent results from Gallup’s running survey (although it’s worth noting that immigration is now climbing fast on this chart).

To be sure, there’s evidence the link between the economy and presidents’ approval might be weakening as partisan loyalties shift — but it doesn’t appear to be gone entirely.

It does seem like things might be finally turning a corner for Biden. Surveys, including Gallup’s, have shown a marked uptick in economic confidence in recent months, even if the figures are still overall well below what Biden would like to see.

“There has been substantial empirical progress made,” Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi said. “I think if they continue making that case, the public, slowly and surely, will come around by the time they start voting in October and November for president.”

The Biden and Trump economies were both pretty good — but only one president has gotten credit

There’s no denying that the economy was good under Trump, and the 2019 pre-pandemic economy is now seen as a baseline against which Biden’s economy is being judged.

But Trump arrived in office when the economy was already pretty strong. He was “just riding on the coattails of a 10-year-long economic recovery,” said Alí R. Bustamante, deputy director of worker power and economic security at Roosevelt Forward, the progressive political arm of the Roosevelt Institute.

The economy continued to grow modestly on his watch until the pandemic hit in 2020, and after that, his stimulus checks kept it buoyant for a while. The stock market saw significant growth under Trump (and at least for the last year, under Biden, too — more on that later).

But some of Trump’s signature economic policies have also been found to have had little to no measurable effect on the economy — and a few might have even hurt. Multiple studies have shown that the Trump tariffs at best had a neutral effect on the economy and at worst cost America hundreds of thousands of jobs and higher prices for consumers. And his 2017 tax cuts, which increased investment in the economy and contributed to modest wage growth in the short term, fell far short of Republicans’ promise that they would pay for themselves and are projected to significantly raise federal debt and increase income inequality.

Biden, on the other hand, faced the immediate task upon assuming office of heading off a recession as the country started to bounce back from the pandemic. The US did recover from that pandemic economic slump. But there is evidence that his policies, including the stimulus checks he issued, contributed to an inflationary spiral.

The US did, however, manage to curb inflation faster than other economically developed countries, while also maintaining much lower levels of unemployment and higher wage growth.

The Federal Reserve might deserve most of the credit for that, given its carefully timed interest rate hikes. But Biden also has a very successful legislative record, including the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act — laws that experts say can help bolster the economy. And he took steps to reduce pandemic-induced pressure on supply chains, making it easier for truck drivers to become licensed and allowing some major ports to operate nonstop.

The US economy is growing faster than projected, driven largely by consumer spending and the Federal Reserve’s successful efforts to get inflation under control without triggering a recession.

While inflation has come down substantially from its 9.1 percent peak in June 2022, it still remains above the Fed’s target rate, and “ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured,” Fed chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in early March. In February, inflation was higher than economists projected, at 3.2 percent, adding to the uncertainty.

But Americans’ wages are now growing faster than inflation, which should relieve some of the pressure of higher prices.

The problem for Biden is that the memory of peak inflation is still fresh, and not everyone has experienced wage growth equally. Bustamante said that younger workers and low earners account for the lion’s share of wage growth in the current economy.

The president should speak to these challenges, acknowledging that “some people are suffering and things are not exactly where they want it to be” without selling short what’s working, Amandi said.

What is working is Biden’s strategy on jobs.

Unemployment reached its lowest level since 1969 under Biden, and the US gained a record 7.27 million new jobs in 2021, fueled by a recovery in the labor market as vaccines became available and the country opened up. Job creation has remained strong in the years since, but slowed to 2.7 million jobs added in 2023.

The stock market has also been setting new record highs after growing a whopping 24 percent last year — driven by optimism that the Fed will soon cut rates and that companies in the tech and energy sectors have outperformed expectations.

This means that Trump no longer has the only claim to a strong stock market during the last few years. Instead, he’s had to resort to claiming credit (unconvincingly) for the current market. For instance, he recently posted on Truth Social that the US was experiencing a “TRUMP STOCK MARKET” in anticipation of him winning the 2024 election.

Biden’s challenge is speaking to Americans who are still hurting

The picture of the economy isn’t entirely rosy.

After a brief spike in savings rates during the pandemic due to a series of stimulus checks, Americans are now saving less than they were pre-pandemic. There are a few reasons for this: Of course, everything costs more, but interest rates are also higher, meaning that it’s now more expensive to borrow. And higher borrowing costs have eaten into Americans’ savings.

In spite of all of that, Americans are still buying stuff in droves, and not just necessities: Restaurants, airlines, and hotels have been some of the biggest beneficiaries.

There’s a question, however, of how long this can last before the money dries up.

Americans are pulling from their now-depleted savings and amassing record-high debt on credit cards and other revolving plans in which consumers can repeatedly borrow money up to a set limit and repay in installments. Young adults in particular, many of whom are also struggling with high student loan debt, are increasingly falling behind on their credit card payments. At some point, something has to give.

This might be part of the reason many Americans still yearn for the economy of 2019, when they had more cash on hand and didn’t have to resort to putting purchases on a credit card.

Still, Bustamante isn’t too worried about the long-term economic impacts, given that the Fed is expected to cut interest rates this year, which should provide relief to households carrying large balances and make it easier for them to pay off debt. But if the Fed waits much longer, Americans might not feel the effects before the November election.

So while most of the economic indicators spell good news for Biden and for America, the question is whether he can persuade voters who feel otherwise and remain nostalgic for Trump’s economy.

“The general perception is that the economy was better before the pandemic than it is now,” said Ayres, the GOP pollster. “And that perception is powerful politically.”

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how the public views Joe Biden and the economy at the start of the new year. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,140 adults from Jan. 16-21, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology.

Americans’ views of the nation’s economy – while mostly stagnant for the past few years – are showing signs of improvement. Slightly more than a quarter (28%) rate economic conditions as excellent or good, a 9 percentage point increase from last April.

Virtually all the change since then has come among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Currently, 44% of Democrats have positive views of the economy – the highest share of Joe Biden’s presidency.

The new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Jan. 16-21 among 5,140 adults, finds that Biden’s own job rating remains highly negative: Just 33% of Americans approve of his job performance, unchanged from last month.

The economy, past and future; top concerns

Despite the improvement in economic attitudes, the public is far less upbeat today than it was from 2018 through early 2020, during Donald Trump’s presidency and prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Economic ratings remain far less positive than before the pandemic. In January 2020, 57% of Americans rated economic conditions as excellent or good; positive ratings fell to 23% in April of that year, as the coronavirus outbreak spread across the country. Views of the economy improved early during Biden’s first few months in office but declined subsequently.

The public’s future economic outlook turns less negative. The share of Americans saying economic conditions will be worse a year from now has fallen from 46% last April to 33% today.

However, more continue to say that conditions will be worse than better (26%) next year; 41% expect the economy will be about the same as it is today.

There’s less concern about energy prices and the stock market. A sizable majority of Americans (72%) say they are very concerned about prices for food and consumer goods, little changed from last year. The cost of housing also is a major issue, with 64% very concerned.

However, the shares expressing a great deal of concern about prices of gasoline and energy and how the stock market is doing have declined 9 points and 8 points, respectively, since last January.

In their own words: Americans on the economy

When the majority of Americans who rate economic conditions poor or only fair are asked why they feel this way, most point to inflation or high prices. Nearly half (45%) specifically mention high inflation (28%) or the high cost of living (21%); 11% specifically point to the high cost of food and groceries or the cost of housing.

People who view the economy positively – those who rate conditions as excellent or good – most often say low unemployment is a major reason why they feel the way they do (43% say this). Other factors cited are that inflation has come down (18%), wage growth (10%), or the strong performance of the stock market (9%).

Biden’s job performance, personal traits

Currently, 33% of Americans approve of Joe Biden’s job performance, while 65% disapprove. Biden’s job rating has not been above 40% since April 2022.

Young adults are negative about Biden’s job performance. Biden’s job rating is low across all age groups, including young adults. Just 27% of adults ages 18 to 29 approve of the way Biden is handling his job as president, while 71% disapprove.

Black adults are divided over Biden. About as many Black adults disapprove (49%) as approve (48%) of Biden’s job performance. Biden’s job rating is lower among Asian (39%), Hispanic (32%) and White (30%) adults.

Views of Biden’s personal traits have grown less positive. Biden gets his most positive ratings for being even-tempered (62% say this phrase describes him very or fairly well) and standing up for what he believes in (50%).

Far fewer Americans describe him as mentally sharp (29%), inspiring (26%) or energetic (24%). For the most part, perceptions of Biden’s personal traits have followed the same downward trajectory as his job ratings.

Judgments on Biden’s legacy

The share of Americans saying that Biden will be an unsuccessful president in the long run has increased steadily over the course of his administration.

Currently, 55% say he will be an unsuccessful president while just 23% say he will be successful; 20% say it is too early to tell. These opinions, like other views of Biden, are deeply partisan: Republicans overwhelmingly say Biden will be unsuccessful (87%).

Among Democrats, 45% say he will be successful, 26% say unsuccessful, and 28% say it is too early to tell.

Other findings on partisan compromise and the House GOP impeachment inquiry

A majority of Democrats (59%) say Biden should try his best to work with GOP leaders to accomplish things, even if that disappoints some of his voters; only 32% of Republicans say the same of GOP leaders trying to reach compromises with Biden. These opinions have changed little over the course of Biden’s presidency.

During the Trump administration, Democrats were less likely to say their party’s leaders should seek compromise with Trump than Republicans were to say their party should try to seek political compromise with Democratic leaders.

About half of Americans (52%) approve of House Republicans’ decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, while 45% disapprove. These opinions – and views about whether Biden has done anything that is grounds for his impeachment – are deeply divided along partisan lines: 85% of Republicans approve of the inquiry, while 77% of Democrats disapprove.

Relatively few Americans (16%) say they are following news about the impeachment inquiry launched by House Republicans into Biden’s conduct and possible connections to his son Hunter’s business dealings extremely or very closely."

United States President Joe Biden has hailed the US economy as the “envy of the world” as he seeks to assuage voters’ doubts about his economic stewardship in an election year.

In a fiery State of the Union address on Thursday, Biden pointed to a series of economic data points, including record job creation and rock-bottom unemployment, to make the case that the economy has gone from strength to strength on his watch.

“I inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now our economy is the envy of the world!” Biden told the joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

“Fifteen million new jobs in just three years – that’s a record! Unemployment at 50-year lows. A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is an act of hope.”

While there is room to quibble with some of Biden’s figures – the record creation data is skewed by the fact that there were so many job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic – the president’s overall argument is on solid ground.

By most accounts, the US economy is in an extremely strong position.

Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.1 percent last year – far ahead of other advanced economies. That performance is all the more remarkable considering that economists widely predicted a recession in 2023.

Inflation, a persistent thorn in the side of US consumers both during and after the pandemic, is now below 3 percent.

The problem for Biden, who is facing Republican challenger Donald Trump in November, is that voters are giving him little credit for these undeniably impressive numbers.

Poll after poll has shown that Americans don’t feel especially optimistic about the economy.

In a New York Times-Siena Poll published earlier this week, 51 percent of respondents rated the economy as “poor,” while 23 percent said it was “only fair.”

Only 26 percent rated it as “good” or “excellent.”

Even worse for Biden, voters rate Trump as more trustworthy in handling economic matters.

In an NBC News poll published last month, 55 percent of respondents said Trump would do a better job on the economy, compared with 33 percent who chose Biden.

Another poll by CBS News showed that 65 percent of Americans recalled Trump’s economy being good, compared with 38 percent who gave the current economy a positive assessment.

Biden will be keenly aware that US presidential elections are often won and lost on the economy (“It’s the economy, stupid” continues to be a popular slogan to describe voters’ priorities more than 30 years after it was uttered during Bill Clinton’s 1992 election campaign).

Given perceptions of the economy, it is perhaps not surprising that Trump is leading Biden in most polls.

In his State of the Union address, Biden devoted much of his time promoting the message that the economy should be fair and benefit all Americans.

“America’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind!” Biden, who proposed hiking taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, said.

With a little under eight months until Americans vote, Biden has some time to turn around perceptions.

If he can’t, he will struggle to secure a second term."

A recent CBS News poll found that 65% of Americans remember the economy under former President Donald Trump as being good, compared with 38% giving the current economy under President Joe Biden the same positive assessment.

On Super Tuesday, Biden and Trump won commanding victories across nearly all the states holding Democratic and Republican nominating contests, according to CBS News projections. That is solidifying the likelihood of a general election rematch between the two in November.

In fact, almost 6 in 10 voters polled by CBS News described the U.S. economy under Biden as bad, even as economists' views are much more upbeat due to the nation's stronger-than-expected GDP and low unemployment. Instead of entering a recession, as many economists had predicted last year, the economy appears to be on track to generate continued growth and more jobs while inflation recedes.

The key to the disconnect could reside in how voters experienced the economy between 2017 to 2019, during the first three years of Trump's presidency, prior to the pandemic's upheaval in 2020, compared with the post-pandemic years.

""These are two very different periods from an economic standpoint,"" noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. ""The 2017-2019 period was the end of the longest business cycle on record — the economy was doing well, the labor market was quite strong. We had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, we had an economy growing at a sub-2% rate but still moving forward.""

Overall, he added, ""There was essentially a pretty steady state of the economy before the pandemic.""

In other words, the economy prior to the pandemic was chugging along, providing a strong if not stellar environment. But the post-pandemic economy introduced a number of upheavals, including a labor shortage and the highest inflation in 40 years — which has since receded but remains above its pre-pandemic levels.

""There is that sentiment that you are still coming out of a shock,"" he added.

To be sure, presidents often get credit when the economy is performing well and are blamed when it tanks, even though there's a limit to how much influence the commander in chief has over such a complex system. Indeed, the economy's performance is often tied to boom-and-bust cycles that don't have much to do with who's occupying the White House.

Here's what the data shows about the 2017-2019 economy under Trump versus the 2021-2023 economy under Biden.

Inflation

The major difference between the two periods boils down to inflation, or the upward change in prices for goods and services.

From 2017 to 2019, inflation hovered at about 2% per year – a low enough level where people generally don't notice changes from day to day. But when COVID-19 shut global supply chains and caused a labor shortage, prices shot up, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.

Suddenly, shoppers were reminded of inflation each time they went to the grocery store – an issue that remains a pain point for consumers. Even though inflation has receded, prices aren't going back to their pre-pandemic levels, and that continues to eat into consumers' budgets.

""We're coming out of an environment where inflation has become a key topic, a key issue, a key point of conversation, whereas it wasn't for most of the three decades that preceded the pandemic,"" Daco noted. ""It's gone from a non-issue to an essential issue, and that for me is the key reason people are feeling more downbeat than economic conditions would dictate.""

Consumers value predictability when it comes to prices, something that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted when he spoke with CBS News last month.

""I can't overstate how important it is to restore price stability, by which I mean inflation is low and predictable and people don't have to think about it in their daily lives,"" Powell said. ""That's where we were for 20 years. We want to get back to that.""

Wages

Wages rose at about 3% annually prior to the pandemic, representing solid gains, yet far from the strides of the late 1990s, when workers enjoyed pay bumps of about 5% annually.

But more importantly, wage growth from 2017 to 2019 inched ahead of inflation, providing American workers with more purchasing power.

That flipped in the wake of the pandemic, when wage growth failed to keep up with inflation. Suddenly, workers were losing purchasing power, an issue they encountered on every grocery trip, when they faced sky-high egg prices and more costly basics. With wages trailing inflation, many felt they were losing ground.

The good news for workers: Wages started trending ahead of inflation about a year ago.

GDP

One strength of the post-pandemic period has been better-than-expected gross domestic product, or the economy's total output of goods and services.

While voters may not notice GDP on a personal level, a growing economy enables companies to expand and hire more workers. Businesses can also afford to pay higher wages when they have more demand for their goods or services.

Importantly, the economy so far has dodged a recession, which many economists had predicted would occur as a result of the Federal Reserve's flurry of interest rate hikes, which typically cause businesses to pull back on spending, given the higher cost of borrowing.

""Like the Energizer Bunny, the U.S. economy just won't quit,"" Oxford Economics said in a January report on GDP.

Grading the Trump versus Biden economies

Many economists today say the U.S. is showing surprising economic resilience, dodging a recession and continuing to add jobs.

But, Daco noted, the economy is still recovering from the shock of the pandemic. And Americans are also facing other changes, such as higher interest rates — a result of the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation — which means it's more expensive now to buy a home, car or make any purchase with debt versus during Trump's presidency.

The economy in 2019 ""was an A economy,"" Daco said. ""It was growing at a steady state.""

The economy now? ""It's a B on track to an A,"" he added. ""It's progressing, but we're not quite there yet."""

By many metrics, the US economy is humming along. The jobs market is robust; consumers are spending again; and inflation has eased to a three-year low.

That has prompted President Joe Biden to repeatedly ask his advisers: Why then are so many Americans still not feeling great about the economy?

The significant gulf between a string of positive economic indicators and the public’s stubbornly grim sentiment about the US economy has been the subject of the president’s frequent inquiries when he has spoken with members of his economic team in recent weeks and months, sources familiar with those discussions told CNN.

That disconnect looms large over Biden’s political prospects, with White House advisers and campaign officials acknowledging that how Americans feel about the economy could be decisive in determining whether the president can win a second term in November.

Inflation began to spike early in the president’s term and has consistently proved to be one of Biden’s most persistent political problems. While inflation has eased in recent months, prices on most goods are still higher than they were in the spring of 2021.

Still, Biden’s economic advisers are increasingly telling the president in private that they feel optimistic about the direction things are headed. Historic-high prices that plagued the first few years of the Biden administration continue to moderate, all while economic growth is outpacing expectations. Advisers are also reminding the president that with each passing day, the unique trauma of the Covid-19 pandemic is getting smaller and smaller in the rearview mirror for many Americans.

If those trend lines continue, they have cautiously told Biden, consumer sentiment, too, should begin to course-correct.

But one senior adviser to the president told CNN the one thing they have not offered Biden is a prediction for when the American public’s psychology about the economy will have meaningfully improved. “I would never tell the president, ‘Sir, by March 17, we’ll know,’” that adviser said. “I would never say that. No one should, and he wouldn’t believe it if I did.”

Still, White House officials have been encouraged by early indications suggesting the public sentiment on the economy is starting to shift.

A survey from the University of Michigan released Friday showed consumer outlook soar 13% in January, reaching the highest level since the summer of 2021. Several days before that, consumer confidence as measured by the Conference Board jumped to a two-year high. Meanwhile, a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS indicated pessimism about the economy could be easing, with 26% of Americans saying they feel the economy is starting to recover from problems of the past few years – up from 20% last summer.

But the president confronts a steep uphill battle on the economic front as his reelection campaign prepares for what it expects will be a rematch against former President Donald Trump in November.

A majority of Americans – 55% – said in the recent CNN poll that they believe Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, while just 26% believe his policies have improved conditions. The president’s approval rating for handling the economy hasn’t broken the 40% mark since December 2021, and it currently stands at 37%.

While Biden and his advisers hope the economic trend lines will continue in the right direction, aides also acknowledge they have their work cut out for them on convincing voters that Biden’s domestic policies have helped fuel the economic recovery. That also doesn’t factor in the possibility of unforeseen economic obstacles, including those created by geopolitical conflicts.

There is also a delicate balancing act for the president to execute: Touting economic progress while being publicly sympathetic to the reality that many Americans still feel burdened by high prices, including on rent, housing and food.

To that end, Biden has started testing out lines that point the finger at some corporations that he says are taking advantage of the fact that prices were at record highs for so long.

Speaking in Columbia, South Carolina, last weekend, Biden noted the cost of everything from eggs to milk to gas have recently fallen.

“But for all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off. Price gouging, junk feeds, greedflation, shrinkflation,” Biden added. “America – we’re tired of being played for suckers!”

The sentiment is being pushed by other Democrats, too – Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania recently released a series of reports examining both “greedflation” and “shrinkflation” – terms that refer to companies raising prices on goods at a faster clip than inflation and reducing product sizes without simultaneously lowering prices.

And as Biden addressed culinary union workers at a hotel cafeteria in Las Vegas on Monday morning, he pointed to a classic American candy bar to gripe about shrinkflation. A recent New York Times op-ed by the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management that used the price of Snickers bars to examine why so many Americans are still unhappy – despite falling inflation – had caught the president’s eye.

“They haven’t raised the price of a Snickers bar. They just took 10% of it out,” Biden said. “No, no, it’s much smaller. So that’s how they make more money.”"

President Biden used his State of the Union address Thursday to highlight economic progress, eight months ahead of an election which will test voters' confidence in his economic stewardship.

""I inherited an economy that was on the brink,"" Biden told a packed chamber at the U.S. Capitol. ""Now our economy is the envy of the world.""

Polls show many voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy, despite strong job gains, low unemployment and faster GDP growth than many forecasters had expected.

Inflation has also cooled significantly since hitting a four-decade high in 2022. But high prices remain a source of frustration for many voters and a potential liability for the president.

The White House says lowering costs for working families is a top priority.

""We're cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging or deceptive pricing from food to health care to housing,"" Biden said.

What the White House is doing

The president also highlighted his administration's efforts to combat hidden fees levied by banks, hotels and other businesses.

""I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I'm eliminating,"" Biden said.

The president accused Republicans of catering to wealthy business and individuals. His upcoming budget will propose higher corporate tax rates — a nonstarter in the currently divided Congress.

""A fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make a country great: health care, education, defense and more,"" Biden said. ""The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the federal deficit.""

Biden's perception problem

Surveys by the University of Michigan show that consumer sentiment about the economy has improved in recent months, as inflation moderated and the stock market hit record highs. So far, though, that hasn't given a boost to the president's approval ratings. An average of polls from Real Clear Politics shows only about 4 in 10 people approve of Biden's handling of the economy.

""The president proudly proclaims Bidenomics is working! Bless his heart. We know better,"" said Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, who gave the official Republican response to Biden's speech. ""Hardworking families are struggling to make ends meet today. And with soaring mortgage rates and sky-high childcare costs, they're also struggling to plan for tomorrow.""

Wages have been climbing faster than prices for most of the last year, but workers have not yet fully recovered from the spike in inflation two years ago. The average worker's real buying power is slightly lower now than it was when Biden took office, although inflation-adjusted wages are higher than they were before the pandemic.

How the job market looks

Biden touted the strong job market, which has kept the unemployment rate under 4% for two full years — the longest such stretch since the Vietnam War.

Employers added more than twice as many jobs during Biden's first three years in office as they did during the comparable period under former President Donald Trump. The comparison looks worse for Trump if you count his final year in office, when the pandemic threw millions of people out of work. Trump was the only president since Herbert Hoover to leave the White House with fewer jobs in the U.S. than when he took office."

Shelton, 67, drives an Uber to help pay rent in Aurora, Colorado. An advance on her pay covered her apartment’s security deposit. But it also cut into her next paycheck, leaving her bank account dangerously low when the rent was due — a cycle that never seems to end.

“I’m always one step behind,” said Shelton, her voice choking up. “It’s a nightmare, it’s a freaking nightmare right now.”

The United States is slogging through a housing affordability crisis that was decades in the making. At the root of this problem: America failed to build enough homes for its growing population. The shortage strikes at the heart of the American dream of homeownership — dampening President Joe Biden’s assurances that the U.S. economy is strong and underscoring the degree to which Republican Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive GOP nominee for 2024, has largely overlooked the shortage.

The lack of housing has caused a record number of renters to devote an excessive amount of income to housing, according to a Harvard University analysis. Not enough homes are for sale or being built, keeping prices elevated. Average mortgage rates have more than doubled and further worsened affordability.

In fact, the Census Bureau reported that homeownership fell slightly at the end of last year in an otherwise solid economy. If it wasn’t for shelter costs, inflation — Biden’s most pronounced economic problem — would be running at a healthy and stable 1.8%. Instead, it’s hovering around 3.2%.

Administration officials are confident that shelter inflation will soon cool, but the damage across several years is apparent to advocates and economists.

“I’ve been doing housing work for 30 years — the housing affordability challenge is the worst I’ve ever seen in my career,” said Shaun Donovan, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama years who now leads the nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners.

Donovan noted that this is an increasingly bipartisan challenge that could bring the political parties together. Expensive housing was once the domain of Democratic areas such as New York City and San Francisco. It’s now moved into Republican states as places such as Boise, Idaho, grapple with higher prices.

“It is a first-tier issue almost everywhere,” he said. “And that is changing the national politics around it in a way that I think is quite different than I’ve ever seen.”

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that the outcome of the November election could ultimately depend on the path of 30-year mortgage rates.

Rates currently average about 6.74%. If they dropped closer to 6%, the odds of a Biden victory would increase. But rates moving near 8% might enable Trump to prevail, Zandi said.

“Given the current housing affordability crisis, higher rates will make owning a home completely out of reach for nearly all potential first-time homebuyers,” he said. “Since homeownership is a key part of the American dream, if it appears unattainable, this will deeply impact voters’ sense of the economy.”

Biden, a Democrat, acknowledged the pain many are feeling in his State of the Union address earlier this month and in his budget proposal released on Monday.

The president wants to fund the building and preservation of 2 million housing units — a meaningful sum, but not enough to solve the shortage. He also proposed a tax credit worth up to $10,000 to homebuyers. Over the past three years, he has increased rental assistance to 100,000 households.

“The bottom line is we have to build, build, build,” Biden said Monday in a speech to the National League of Cities. “That’s how we bring down housing costs for good.”

Rapidly climbing home prices were also a festering problem under Trump, who first achieved celebrity status as a real estate developer. While president, Trump called for limiting construction in the suburbs. He claimed during the 2020 election that Biden’s policies to spur building and affordability would “destroy your neighborhood.”

During the 2018 to 2020 years of Trump’s presidency, the country’s housing shortage surged 52% to 3.8 million units, according to the mortgage company Freddie Mac.

The Associated Press contacted Trump’s campaign for his policy plans but did not get a response. The America First Policy Institute, a think tank promoting Trump’s vision, said the key is to cut government borrowing to reduce mortgage rates. The former president has pledged to reduce deficits, but an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget shows that his policies in office will have likely added more than $8 trillion to the national debt.

“The best way for us to improve access to homeownership for young people is to get interest rates back down, not to provide subsidies that cause housing unaffordability to worsen,” said Mike Faulkender, chief economist at the institute.

Lower rates might play well with voters, but most economists say they would at best offer temporary financial relief. Purchase prices would likely adjust upward in response to greater demand from falling rates.

Construction, the more enduring solution, would take years to achieve and require new rules by states and cities. The administration is trying to incentivize zoning changes, but the major choices are outside the White House’s control.

“Even as incomes are going up and the economy is doing well and inflation is coming down, people can’t buy homes,” said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the brokerage Redfin. “That’s like the biggest problem for Biden because it’s not one that he can solve.”

The general rule of thumb is that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on rent or a mortgage. A typical household looking to buy a home would have to devote 41% of its income to mortgage payments, according to Redfin.

There are far-reaching economic risks because of this. High housing costs can lead people to cut back spending elsewhere. Advocates said it enables landlords to neglect their properties since there is always a ready tenant.

Evictions can worsen health and educational outcomes for children and exact an even wider cost on society, said Zach Neumann, a Denver-based lawyer who provides more than $30 million annually in rental assistance through the nonprofit Community Economic Defense Project.

The cumulative costs of evicting poorer renters are ""$20,000 to $30,000 a year when you include shelter nights and emergency room visits,” Neumann said. “It’s really overwhelming when you think about the total numbers and these folks are fighting to have a roof over their heads.”

While there is bipartisan agreement on the need for more housing, there has yet to be a significant plan that has passed the House and Senate. Biden has proposed housing aid throughout his administration that never materialized.

“Had Congress passed some of the investments that the president has called for since the beginning of the administration, had they done that three years ago, as he was advocating, we’d have affordable units coming online right now,” said Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council.

But Mark Calabria, who was director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency during the Trump administration, said that many of the federal tools to increase housing such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit could further push up demand without adding enough construction.

“My worry would be we’ve done a number of things that increased demand when the problem is supply,” said Calabria, now an adviser with the libertarian Cato Institute.

But for renters such as Lori Shelton in Colorado, the debate about how to add housing supply is cold comfort when she owes rent now. She’s previously dealt with the threat of eviction and late fees. She gets some rent money from her son, but she has also relied at times on her church to cover the $2,399 a month.

“I don’t think the majority of us have that savings account,” she said. “If you spend that much on your rent and your groceries and your car and your bills, you don’t have much for a fallback.”"

Most adults still consider the national economy to be in poor shape, but there has been a slight increase in those who have a positive opinion. However, this improvement in the view of the economy has not translated into an improvement in President Biden’s approval ratings.

Thirty-five percent say the national economy is good, up slightly from 30% in an AP-NORC poll conducted in December and 24% in January 2023. The economy is seen as poor by 65%, down from 69% in December and 76% a year ago. Both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to describe the economy as good compared with last January. But, while 58% of Democrats now have a positive opinion of the economy, only 15% of Republicans agree.

Thirty-eight percent approve of Biden’s job performance, including 70% of Democrats and just 7% of Republicans. The public has similar opinions about how the president is handling foreign policy in general, and specifically relations with China, as well as the economy.

Biden’s approval on both his overall job as president and his handling of the economy are similar to the last several months, with his rating on the economy remaining below 40%.

While Democrats overall have positive views of Biden, Democrats ages 18 to 39 are much more negative than older Democrats.

The nationwide poll was conducted January 25-29, 2024 using the AmeriSpeak® Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,152 adults. The margin of sampling error is +/- 4.0 percentage points."

Biden said he “inherited an economy that was on the brink” and claimed that his administration had helped U.S. businesses and consumers bounce back from the pandemic. He also talked about plans for further recovery.

In the address, President Biden defended his record on the economy. He said legislation passed in his first term, like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and CHIPS Act, helped create a healthy labor market.

“Fifteen million new jobs in just three years — a record. A record,” Biden stated. “Unemployment at 50-year lows.”

The president pointed out that the Inflation Reduction Act will cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year starting in 2025. The Act also allows Medicare to haggle over the prices it pays for some drugs.

“This year, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis,” Biden said. “It’s now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.”

But President Biden can’t just do that. He needs Congress to change the law. And even if the president wins a second term, he could face obstacles on Capitol Hill, according to Larry Levitt, head of health policy at KFF.

“So if Congress is divided, many of these plans from President Biden won’t be worth the paper they’re printed on,” he said.

That goes for many of the other goals in the president’s speech — including revamping the tax code, building and renovating two million affordable homes, and making college more affordable."

That’s likely because they have been left behind, especially native-born Americans.

This is perhaps most evident in figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If one looks only at the headline numbers in each monthly report, the economy appears to be off to the races. Nonfarm payrolls are up, and unemployment is down.

But few analysts have bothered asking questions like what kinds of jobs are being added to the economy, how much they pay, who has the jobs, or why the unemployment rate is so low.

The economy is not adding high-paying, full-time jobs that come with benefits. The number of full-time jobs was roughly flat over the last 12 months, so essentially all the job growth was part-time employment. As the layoffs mount, Americans are replacing their previous job with more than one part-time job.

>>> Americans in Crosshairs of Cost-of-Living Crisis

That increases the number of payrolls without increasing the number of people employed, which helps explain the unprecedented disparity between the two categories. The shift to lower-paying part-time employment has become so dramatic that it is dragging down average hourly wages.

In fact, December and January marked the biggest two-month decline in full-time employment since the government-imposed lockdowns of March and April 2020.

Aside from those losing their primary job, Americans are increasingly taking second or third jobs to make ends meet.

But even the BLS statistics on multiple job holders understate the extent of the problem. When a person gets a second job, that increases the number of multiple job holders. But when that person gets a third job, it doesn’t.

With 60% of Americans living from paycheck to paycheck, it’s no surprise that so many of them have gotten extra jobs as they rack up a record $1.1 trillion in credit card debt to cover necessities.

The low unemployment rate is also a facade as the pandemic recedes from the headlines, the product of over 5 million people missing from the labor force. The number of people not in the labor force was trending down before the lockdowns in early 2020, but it has remained elevated since then and is still above June 2020 levels.

Adding those missing workers back into the labor force yields an unemployment rate of over 6%. While not horrific, that percentage is common during recessions and shows that Americans are not faring as well as is being portrayed.

Yet the best explanation for Mr. Biden’s poor polling on the economy has to do with who is getting these millions of new jobs. It turns out they are not native-born Americans.

While last month’s job data quickly garnered hyperbolic terms like “blowout,” a fairer word would be depressing for many Americans. Native-born employment was not only a whopping 5.5 million below its pre-pandemic trend but was even 121,000 below its pre-pandemic level, or 0.1%.

>>> Home Prices: From American Dream to American Nightmare

Conversely, foreign-born employment was 2.8 million above its pre-pandemic level, or 10.3%, having returned to its pre-pandemic trend last year. It turns out all the job gains since the beginning of 2020 have gone to the foreign-born, while native-born Americans have actually lost jobs on net.

Even the BLS concedes that its figures reflect at least some illegal aliens working in America. With millions of such illegal aliens pouring across the southern border due to Biden administration policies, it makes sense that this would augment the workforce of foreign-born people here legally and boost employment numbers.

That native-born Americans have made no progress in terms of job numbers in four years is a key reason why they view the economy so poorly, but it isn’t the only one. Their inflation-adjusted weekly earnings are still down 4.2% under Mr. Biden, according to BLS estimates.

The reality is even worse because the BLS has grossly undercounted many price increases, such as the cost of homeownership. Using rental data, the BLS estimates this has risen by less than 20% in the last three years.

Conversely, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta uses real-world housing data to estimate that the cost of homeownership has risen 76.5% over the same time, or four times the official BLS metric.

It is surprisingly easy to square the circle of good economic headlines and lousy polling on the economy: The benefits of “Bidenomics” go to a few, and Americans as a whole come last."

President Joe Biden is fighting to convince inflation-weary voters that the U.S. economy is healthy.

""America has the best economy in the world,"" he told NBC's ""TODAY"" on Monday, laying out an argument that is central to his reelection campaign.

America's economic standing in the world is becoming an early flashpoint on the campaign trail, where former President Donald Trump routinely depicts the United States as a commercial wasteland.

""We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming,"" Trump shouted at a Georgia rally last month.

But the numbers paint a different picture, one more in line with Biden's narrative of American economic dominance than Trump's apocalyptic warnings.

Inflation has fallen sharply from its 2022 highs, although it has ticked back up in the past several months.

""On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday.

Meanwhile, U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.5% in 2023, significantly outpacing that of other developed economies, according to a January report from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF projected that the U.S. will hold that lead in 2024, though it expects the rate to come down to 2.1%.

Two other large advanced economies, Canada and Germany, lagged with 2023 GDP growth at 1.1% and negative 0.3%, respectively.

""The U.S. economy is leading the way for the global economy. It's driving the global economic train,"" Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi told CNBC.

As economists watch U.S. inflation's wobbly descent, the numbers still remain hot in developed economies worldwide. In Canada, for example, the consumer price index rose 3.9% in 2023 while in Germany, the inflation rate was 5.9%.

Countries calculate inflation differently, which makes direct comparisons difficult.

But Zandi said that even adjusting for the calculation discrepancies, the U.S. still looks good on the inflation front.

""Using the same methodology as let's say the European Union, the Fed's already at target, inflation is already below 2%,"" he said.

And even as interest rates spiked, the labor market has stayed strong. In March, U.S. private companies added 184,000 jobs, payrolls processing firm ADP reported on Wednesday, well ahead of the Dow Jones upwardly revised estimate of 155,000 jobs. It is the fastest employment growth the U.S. economy has seen since July 2023.

The stock market has also made record gains over the past several months and housing values have soared, though they have now begun to decline as inventory improves.

Besides sticky high prices that are projected to cool in the coming year, Zandi said that the fundamentals of the current U.S. economy are nearly ideal: ""The economy is picture perfect. It's hard to argue with it."""

Story Highlights Sub-50% presidential job ratings have usually resulted in electoral defeat

Satisfaction, economy ratings similar to those for losing incumbents

37% say they are better off financially, 45% say worse off

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Several key indicators of the 2024 election environment indicate that President Joe Biden faces an uphill climb to win a second term. His job approval rating, Americans’ satisfaction with how things are going in the country and their confidence in the economy are below the levels associated with successful reelection bids in recent elections.

While Democrats hold a slight edge in national party identification and partisan leanings, that advantage is smaller than what it has been in past presidential elections won by Democratic incumbents.

In less direct measures of the electoral environment, Americans are more inclined to say that they are worse off financially, that it is harder to buy things and that the U.S. is as respected throughout the world as it was before Biden took office.

Biden’s fate will ultimately be determined by whether Americans’ views on these metrics improve over the course of the year (as they did for Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012), stay the same or get worse (as they did for George H.W. Bush in 1992 and Donald Trump in 2020).

Presidential Job Approval

Incumbent job approval is arguably the best predictor of reelection success. Presidents with approval ratings of 50% or higher close to Election Day have all been reelected. All but one president with a sub-50% approval rating lost, the exception being George W. Bush. He won reelection with a 48% approval rating in Gallup’s final 2004 preelection poll taken in late October. However, he registered multiple 50% readings earlier in the month and had a 51% approval rating among likely voters in that final survey.

Among the approval ratings that did not carry incumbents to victory, Trump’s 46% approval rating is the highest and Gerald Ford’s 45% is close behind. The inauspicious ratings descend from there, all the way down to 34% for George H.W. Bush.

Biden’s 41% job approval rating, the lowest among incumbents in January of an election year, puts him in a precarious spot. It has not been unusual for incumbents to be below the 50% threshold this early on. But Biden’s reelection may depend on his ability to boost his numbers close to that threshold, something Clinton, Obama and Richard Nixon were able to do but Trump and Ford were not. Other presidents, including George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, saw significant declines in approval during their fourth year in office.

###Embeddable###

Satisfaction With the State of the Nation

Over the past four decades, incumbent presidents have still been reelected when majorities of Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, but the cutoff seems to be 30% satisfaction. Less than 30% of U.S. adults were satisfied at the time of the 1992 and 2020 elections when the elder Bush and Trump lost, whereas more than 30% were satisfied in the years incumbents won.

Biden started 2024 with 20% of Americans satisfied with the country’s direction. Obama and Clinton had similar marks in January of their reelection years but saw satisfaction increase as the year wore on. For Trump, the opposite was the case, as the relatively high 41% satisfaction in January 2020 was soon dashed by the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn, as well as racial strife associated with the George Floyd killing.

###Embeddable###

Economic Evaluations

Although the economy is always a key issue in presidential election campaigns, Americans’ confidence in the economy is not always determinative of election outcomes. Gallup has computed its Economic Confidence Index in five presidential election years since 1992 when an incumbent sought reelection. The index summarizes Americans’ assessments of current national economic conditions and their perceptions of whether the economy is getting better or worse. Positive scores indicate economic optimism, and negative scores indicate pessimism, with a minimum theoretical score of -100 and a maximum of +100.

Among the past five incumbent elections, Americans were decidedly positive about the economy in one -- 1996, when Clinton was reelected -- and decidedly negative in one -- 1992, when George H.W. Bush was defeated. In 2004, 2012 and 2020, index scores were close to the scale’s zero midpoint, indicating neither positive nor negative views of the economy. In two of those elections (2004 and 2012), the incumbent prevailed, but in 2020, Trump lost, likely because the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed the economy as an issue.

Currently, Americans’ economic confidence is closer to that of 1992 than other incumbent election years. However, the index has been improving in recent months. Biden can hope that economic perceptions follow a similar trajectory to 2012. That year, confidence started more negative than positive but approached a more neutral rating by the election, which Obama won.

###Embeddable###

Party Identification and Leaning

Americans’ partisanship strongly aligns with how they will vote and is thus an important indicator of election outcomes. Democrats typically lead Republicans in Americans’ party preferences; therefore, the size of that lead indicates whether Democrats are in a strong or weak position.

Gallup’s January 2024 poll shows the Democratic Party with a three-point advantage over Republicans: 46% identify as or lean Democratic, and 43% identify as or lean Republican. If this were October, these figures would be concerning for Biden, as it would represent the smallest Democratic advantage in an incumbent election year, including 2004 when Republican George W. Bush won with Democrats holding a five-point edge. In years Democratic incumbents won (1996 and 2012), the Democrats’ party advantage was +10 and +7, respectively.

A possible silver lining for the Biden campaign is that Democrats’ party advantage has often increased between January and October or November of an election year. This has occurred in all election years featuring an incumbent since 1992.

###Embeddable###

While Democratic Party identification and leaning have increased in each of the past five election years involving an incumbent, that pattern has not occurred in other recent elections. In non-incumbent years, Democrats increased their advantage in one (2000), saw no change in another (2016) and saw it shrink in one (2008).

Better Off Than Three Years Ago

Americans are evenly divided in their assessments of whether they are better off now than they were three years ago, with 48% saying they are and 47% saying they are not.

Gallup has asked this question in the early stages of previous election campaigns when incumbents were running for reelection. The current share of U.S. adults who say they are better off now is down from 2020’s pre-pandemic reading, but it is similar to the readings in prior election cycles. In 1992, 1996 and 2003, more Americans said they were better off, and two of the three presidents won reelection. In 2012, slightly more said they were not better off, but Obama still won another term.

###Embeddable###

Americans' perceptions of whether they are personally better off now than three years ago are largely influenced by their party leanings and, to a lesser extent, their income level. There is currently a wide gulf between Democrats’ (74%) and Republicans’ (22%) assessments of whether they are better off than three years ago, and independents are squarely in the middle of the two groups, at 48%.

This is the fifth election cycle of the past six that partisans in the same party as the sitting president seeking reelection are significantly more likely than their counterparts to say they are better off. The gaps in partisans’ reports since 1992 have ranged from four points in 1996 when Clinton ran for a second term to 60 points in 2020 when Trump ran. The current 52-point gap is the second highest.

###Embeddable###

Meanwhile, 53% of those in upper-income households and 50% in middle-income households say they are better off, compared with 41% in lower-income households.

The “better off than three years ago” question is typically only asked early in election campaigns. Near the end of prior campaigns, Gallup has asked Americans whether they were better off than four years ago. That question has not shown an obvious relationship to election outcomes, exemplified by the high scores in the 2020 election that Trump eventually lost and weaker scores in Reagan’s 1984 landslide.

Personal Finances

While the current U.S. inflation rate is far below its 9.1% recent peak in June 2022, it is about twice what it was in November 2020, and many Americans continue to struggle because of high prices. Only 35% of U.S. adults say it is easier to buy things at stores than it was three years ago, while 59% say it is not.

The share of Americans who currently say shopping is not easier is higher than in 1992, 1996, 2003 and 2020. The question was not asked in other presidential election cycles and is not asked at the end of campaigns.

The previous reading from January 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, showed a slim 52% majority saying it was easier for them to make purchases than three years ago, and 36% said it was not.

###Embeddable###

Americans’ reports of their own financial situation are also more negative now than in early 2020. Currently, 37% of U.S. adults say they are financially better off than a year ago, 45% say they are worse off, and 16% volunteer that they are the same. These readings are similar to last year’s but sharply different from the last election year, 2020, when 59% reported being better off and 20% worse off.

###Embeddable###

Looking ahead, a steady 61% majority of Americans think they will be financially better off in a year, but this is lower than the 74% who said the same in 2020.

Readings on these personal finance measures differ significantly by party identification, with Democrats much more positive than Republicans. Democrats (58%) are more than four times as likely as Republicans (14%) to say buying things is easier than it was three years ago. Similarly, Democrats (57%) are nearly three times as likely as their Republican counterparts (20%) to say their personal financial situation is better now than three years ago. Independents’ views on both are closer to Republicans’, as 33% say shopping is easier and 35% report an improvement in their financial situation.

There is no significant difference by household income level in views of buying power, as majorities across income groups say it is not easier to shop. However, lower-income (32%) and middle-income households (36%) are less likely than upper-income households (47%) to say their personal financial situation is better than one year ago.

U.S. International Respect

When it comes to foreign policy, only about one-quarter of Americans, 27%, think the U.S. is as respected throughout the world as it was three years ago, while 67% say it is not. Just 3% volunteer that it is more respected now. Americans were similarly pessimistic about the United States’ international standing in past election years, with no more than 40% (in 1992 and 2000) believing respect for the U.S. remained intact. The current reading is identical to 2003 and similar to 2012 (30%).

###Embeddable###

The U.S. has had varying degrees of involvement in world affairs over the past three years, ranging from its military departure from Afghanistan in 2021, its support for Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war, and its military support for Israel following the October 2023 Hamas invasion of Israel, which resulted in an Israeli military operation in Gaza. Both the Russia-Ukraine and Hamas-Israeli wars are ongoing, and Americans are sharply divided over the proper U.S. role in each.

Democrats are split in their view of whether the U.S. is as respected around the world as it was three years ago, with 47% saying it is and 44% saying it is not. At the same time, 7% of Republicans think the U.S. is as respected, and 91% think it is not. Independents fall in between the partisan groups, with 27% saying it is respected and 67% saying it is not.

Bottom Line

Biden’s reelection chances do not look very favorable in early 2024. His job approval rating is lower than all recent incumbents at the same point, including those who ultimately lost the election, and key national mood indicators are more in line with those for past losers than winners. Party identification offers Biden some hope but depends on Democrats making gains rather than holding steady in national support, something that has happened at least slightly in each of the past five incumbent elections.

Biden’s chances may rest on him experiencing a comeback similar to what Obama achieved in 2012 when Biden was serving as vice president. That year, national mood indicators and Obama’s job approval rating significantly improved during the campaign, and the president was elected to a second term. Unlike Obama, though, Biden also faces questions about his age and ability to carry out his duties in a second term. Biden is also starting at a lower point in job approval than Obama did, meaning he has to show a bigger improvement.

Biden won his first term after national mood indicators worsened throughout the 2020 election year, which led to his defeating Trump, the incumbent.

Many Americans continue to struggle financially, and Biden has so far been unable to convince voters of the economy's health or his accomplishments. If he cannot do so by the summer, particularly before the Democratic National Convention, his chances of winning reelection will grow increasingly bleak.

414,The Economy No Longer Matters for Presidential Approval - TIME,The Economy No Longer Matters for Presidential Approval  TIME,"Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjcyNzI0My91LXMtZWNvbm9teS1iaWRlbi1hcHByb3ZhbC0yMDI0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,TIME,"By Lee Drutman

The U.S. economy is doing better. But President Joe Biden does not appear to be benefitting. His approval remains flat to declining. Biden has trailed Trump by about two percentage points consistently since October.

Many pundits ask: when will Biden start to benefit from an improving economy?

They are asking the wrong question. Presidential approval once corresponded to changing economic conditions. This link is now broken. It probably has been for two decades. Biden’s 2024 chances do not depend on the economy.

This is bad news for our democracy. It means that performance doesn’t matter for presidential incumbents. This undermines a fundamental premise of accountability.

This de-linking between economic performance and presidential approval follows from changes in partisanship and media. As the public has become more polarized, and media more fragmented, political reality has split into three: a Democratic Reality, a Republican Reality, and a Politically Disengaged Reality.

In the Democratic Reality, Democrats are the good people, and Republicans are the bad people. When a Democrat like Joe Biden is in the White House, the Democratic Reality has confidence in the administration. Biden and his administration deserve credit for the good news in the economy and the world more broadly. Bad news, like a rough economic patch, however, is not Biden’s fault. They are due to circumstances beyond his control, and he and his administration are doing the best they can.

Sometimes, Democratic Reality will be critical of Biden and his administration. But the starting premise in Democratic Reality is that Biden’s doing the best he can, and nobody is perfect. And good news should be shared and discussed widely. In Democratic Reality, Biden’s approval remains high. It has nothing to do with the economy.

In Republican Reality, Democrats are the enemy, and Republicans are the heroes. In Republican Reality, as long as Joe Biden is in the White House, America is at risk (though at risk of what depends on the day or week). If anything bad happens, it is clearly Biden’s fault. If anything good happens, it is in spite of Biden. But mostly, Republican Reality tries to ignore the good things that happen, and focus on all the bad things.

In Republican Reality, disapproval of Joe Biden is a first premise. The rest of reality must be made to fit that first premise. This means that among Republicans, approval of Joe Biden will always be in the single digits. The same can be said of any Democrat. It has nothing to do with the economy.

But there is also a third reality: The Politically Disengaged Reality. In this reality, politics and political events exist on the margins, only occasionally interjecting themselves into awareness. This is the reality where news comes through TikTok, Instagram, and other social media. It is a reality where other passions—pop culture, sports, video games, etc—dominate attention. It is a reality for people who don’t care about politics. Increasingly, it’s full of people who feel like the whole system is so corrupt and broken that there is no point in being engaged. There is plenty of evidence to suggest they might be right.

In Politically Disengaged Reality, little political news breaks through. Mostly it’s bad news, since bad news is stickier and more interesting than good news. Conflict also breaks through, since conflict is more interesting than compromise. Bad news and conflict also confirms the pre-existing expectations of those who inhabit this reality: that American politics is deeply broken. Nobody represents them; nobody cares about them. Strong anti-system vibes infuse this reality. I call the voters who inhabit this reality “Shrug Emoji Voters.”

These “Shrug Emoji Voters” sometimes vote, and sometimes don’t. They can be convinced to vote against a candidate they see as a major threat. And they might even get excited about a new candidate, especially a fresh new face (hope springs eternal). But fresh faces constantly disappoint. And once a politician disappoints, there are few second chances. Approval ratings steadily dry up among this group. Like a desert, very little will grow on barren soil once it cracks and craters. If the economy is doing better, they will be the last to know and attribute it to Joe Biden.

It wasn’t always this way. In an earlier era, the realities were much more overlapping because the parties themselves were more overlapping. We once had something more like a four-party system, with liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, alongside conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. More voters were open to at least supporting either party.

And the news environment was less fragmented. Most people read a local paper and a national news magazine, and they saw the same political news, more or less. They could give it a Republican spin or a Democratic spin, but it was still the same news. Even if you weren’t particularly interested in politics, you still had to get the local newspaper to read the sports scores or the movie listings. It was harder to avoid national political news because you still saw the front page, even if you skipped past it.

Now, Democrats and Republicans are more socially and geographically segregated than ever before, and this social and geographic segregation is amplified and exacerbated by the fragmented media landscape It is easier than ever to construct your own reality through À la carte media consumption.

It is also easier than ever to avoid political news altogether, and to thus remain completely ignorant of the state of the economy, or the state of the world. And it may be more rational to do so today, as well. Most of the news is bad. Especially in an era in which each individual article gets its own web-traffic stats, conflict-driven, emotional content is more prized than ever.

Tell me what you think about Joe Biden, and I’ll tell you what you’re going to think of the economy in October. If you like Biden, you’ll like the economy. If you don’t like Biden, you won’t like the economy. People already know what they think. They can now choose the reality to reflect what they already think. LOL. Nothing matters. Shrug.

The era of shared media is not coming back anytime soon. Our best hope lies in more overlapping partisan realities, through more political parties. With two separate partisan realities, the world splits apart. With multiple overlapping partisan realities, perspectives can shift. Different citizens can find different points of entry. We don’t have to agree on everything. But we should at least be able to agree that the world is complex, with multiple perspectives. When reality is bifurcated, politics becomes zero-sum and destructive. If our side is always good, and their side is always bad, the compromise necessary for a healthy democracy becomes impossible."

LAS VEGAS — Near the base of the Rainbow Mountains, Daniel Busby looks up longingly at his two-story “dream” townhouse, with the sliding glass door on its second floor, the balcony that wraps around the master bedroom, the five-minute walk from his kids’ elementary school. “I just fell in love,” said Busby, 33, doing a chef’s kiss and smacking his lips together. “And then we started doing the math.”

The gregarious fry cook has enjoyed the windfalls of pandemic economic recovery overseen by President Biden. The president’s stimulus plan gave lower-wage workers more leverage to demand higher pay from their employers, with those in the service sector — like Busby — seeing particularly robust gains.

He went from being unemployed and working part-time at $15 an hour during the pandemic to a full-time job at the Paris Hotel, mostly at the Martha Stewart franchise, earning $19 an hour preparing a risotto dish and, his favorite, the whole chicken dinner. Busby and his wife now make a combined salary of just under six figures — a previously unimaginable sum.

But the gains have not kept up with rising costs, and that has become a major issue for voters like him. When Biden took the oath of office in January 2021, the average monthly mortgage payment in Las Vegas was about $1,200, according to calculations by Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. That number, for new mortgages, has soared to $2,350 today due to rising interest rates and robust housing prices — the outer edge of what Busby was willing to spend.

By many measures, the U.S. economy is a great success story — recession fears have fallen, along with gas prices and the unemployment rate, while manufacturing construction is up along with nominal wages and the stock market. The United States has grown faster since covid-19 than any peer country. Gas prices, once averaging over $5 a gallon, are now approaching $3. The Federal Reserve projects three interest rate cuts in 2024 that could help buyers like Busby.

But the kitchen-table experience of Biden’s first term — a roller coaster of covid adjustment and international shocks — has meant that many voters have experienced the last few years as a time of relative economic hardship. Despite rising wages, voters as a group lost spending power during 2021 and 2022 and have only recently climbed out of the hole. And even though wages are now outpacing inflation, prices are still continuing to rise: The latest government report showed inflation up 3.4 percent relative to the year before, fueling the anxiety even amid positive economic indicators.

A broad and diverse cross-section of American voters say they are experiencing the Biden economy as a challenging time of rising prices and high interest rates, according to interviews with more than 80 voters in four parts of the country — Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Phoenix and rural Georgia — that will play a major role in choosing the next president.

Adjusted for inflation, the per capita disposable income of U.S. residents rose nearly 1 percent from October 2021 to October 2023, a period that excludes the extraordinary one-time stimulus payments when Biden arrived, according to calculation by Robert Shapiro, a Democratic economist who advised Bill Clinton as president. By comparison, per capita disposable income, after inflation, grew about 7 percent under Donald Trump, during the first 34 months of his presidency.

The good news for Democrats is that the growth in spending power has been picking up over the last year at 3.7 percent through November, potentially setting the stage for a banner 2024, when wages will continue to grow even as the rate of inflation continues to fall.

“If incomes continue to rise rapidly over the next year, people will accept it by the election, especially since Biden’s record on jobs and growth is so much stronger,” Shapiro predicts. “Biden can overcome the fact that his income record — the growth of income — will not be strong over the whole term.”

But that is not the nation’s present-day reality. Biden’s polling on the economy has fallen with consumer confidence since he got into office, only recently stabilizing as confidence has begun to rebound. Wages are up, but the sting of higher grocery, coffee and restaurant bills remain. The president is still looking for credit from the budding manufacturing renaissance brought about by recent bipartisan legislation, though relatively few projects have been announced or begun production yet.

White House advisers are optimistic that the American public will soon internalize the good news and give the president credit before November. His political advisers note that other presidents who won reelection, like Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, overcame challenging first-term economic conditions.

“We’re seeing real progress,” said Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, in a statement. “We have more work to do as we execute President Biden’s agenda, a sharp contrast with congressional Republicans’ plans to cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations while raising health care and prescription drug costs for hard-working American families.”

People like Busby, who voted twice for Obama before sitting out the 2016 and 2020 elections, are not sure they will vote for Biden in 2024 — indecision that could tip the scale in a narrowly divided country. He has chosen, for the moment, to stay with his wife and two daughters, ages 10 and 6, in their 1,100-square-foot Vegas apartment, where the rent recently jumped from $1,100 to $1,600 a month.

After touring more than 30 houses, relentlessly monitoring Zillow and Redfin, and investigating all the first-time home buyer programs they could find, they have put their dream on hold.

“We work full-time hours, but we still can’t afford things. You think, ‘I work full time. I should be able to afford a house,'” he said. “I don’t want to come home one day and then realize I have to pack up and leave. It’s that sense of stability we’re missing.”

‘It’s really hard to keep up’

Milwaukee

Ceree Huley, 75, looked around Gee’s Clippers, the Black-owned Milwaukee barber shop where he works. “This place on a Thursday would be full of people,” he said of the those years before the pandemic.

“I don’t know what the reason they’re not here. … A lot of people are going to do it to themselves,” Huley said, referring to individual haircuts. “Or are they hiding from the costs of the prices that went up 10 dollars or 5 dollars? That could be a factor too.”

After 50 years as a barber, Huley has seen his own wages go up recently but is also paying more for rent after moving to a new place. Unlike some of his customers, he doesn’t blame Biden for his economic situation.

“I don’t know why it is, it seems like the economy gets worse,” said Zontayveon Mosley, a 21-year-old warehouse supervisor, who had come in for a cut. “For the average person who’s making $45,000 to $50,000 a year, it’s really hard to keep up.”

He said he would have backed Biden in 2020, but didn’t vote. He added that he will not vote for him this year and would consider supporting Trump, citing U.S. aid to other countries and the economy.

“Like giving billions of dollars to support others, when we have people that can’t eat, we have people that can’t pay bills, it’s just insane to me,” he said. “I feel like most Black people just lean towards Democrats. But I don’t know, entering the workforce and making money, I own a home. I’ve got to worry about interest rates and all of that. I feel like Trump is a better businessman.”

A stream of Black customers provided a nuanced take on the economy under Biden as they came in and out of the barber shop — decorated with basketball hoops, framed photos of athletes and the forest green Milwaukee Bucks logo sprawled across a gymnasium-style floor, razors buzzing in the background.

The economy here has largely tracked national trends, with weekly wages just below the national average and a nearly identical unemployment rate. William Robinson, a 47-year-old FedEx package handler, said he ends the month with less money than he starts, and it’s “kind of more survival than living” when he goes food shopping. He supported Obama both in 2008 and 2012, but said he will not vote for either Biden or Trump in 2024, describing them as “pretty much the same.”

“You can’t set prices. Inflation, you really don’t control none of that. Really it’s all the stuff that I can’t control that’s kind of making it difficult,” said Robinson, who added that he now needs to make adjustments between wants and needs. “Everybody got their little cheat foods, you know what I’m saying? Like the little cakes outside of the nutritious stuff. You just can’t enjoy it. And even with the stuff that’s nutritious, you got to prioritize, you know?”

Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, said that voter views of the president and the economy “moved in tandem with objective economic indicators tolerably well up until the early 2000s.” Since then, partisanship has become more powerful and the link has begun to break.

In a recent survey, twice as many respondents said they’d heard about inflation compared with the unemployment rate. As for voters’ current perceptions of the economy, Franklin sees a combination of partisan bias and the effect of inflation on real disposable income, especially “coming after this sugar high of transfer payments in the pandemic years.”

It’s a trend that cuts both ways. Ken McClendon, a 51-year-old in the health-care-manufacturing business, said his wages have gone up but his economic situation was better before covid, given that “everything is more expensive now.”

Biden’s handling of the economy was a “little shaky,” he said, before adding, “You have to realize what he walked into.” If the election comes down to a choice between Biden and Trump?

Biden “all the way,” he said.

‘Who gets credit for a dumb idea?’

Dalton, Ga.

Share this article Share

One of Biden’s legislative triumphs can be seen through the trees 80 miles north of Atlanta along Interstate 75, a gray, low-slung roof factory of Qcells North America.

The South Korean-owned plant expanded after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, adding 510 jobs to the growing solar industry. The panels its workers make in a 12-hour shift can produce as much solar power annually as the Hoover Dam’s peak output.

But few at the Oakwood Cafe in nearby Dalton have noticed in this conservative corner of the state, represented by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R). Dalton Mayor David Pennington (R) dismissed the government support of solar panels as the pet project of politicians, embraced both by Vice President Harris, who visited the plant in April, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R).

“Who gets credit for a dumb idea?” Pennington said, laughing. “When both sides are agreeing on something, it probably proves it is a stupid idea.”

Pennington says residents most often ask him what he’s doing to help address the falling test scores of the city’s students. Families tell him that their grocery bills have gone up in the last three years. Pennington said that the night before, after a governmental meeting, he and his wife went to Krystal, a regional fast food joint, and ordered burgers, fries and drinks for $23, a meal he remembers costing $12 five years ago.

At a nearby table, Eric Azua, a local Realtor and registered Republican, made the same point: He has benefited himself from the Qcells expansion. He said he has sold homes to workers who are able to afford more given higher wages, offering Azua better commissions. But he credits local officials for the new jobs, rather than the Biden administration. Like many others in the area, Azua plans to vote for Trump.

“He needs to be replaced,” he said of Biden.

In 2018, Trump’s steep tariffs on solar panels from China prompted Qcells to build the facility in Dalton. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — including a provision by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) — provided tax credits for every stage of the solar manufacturing supply chain, incentivizing Qcells to expand.

Such expansions of U.S. manufacturing have been happening around the country in recent years, spurred by federal incentives supported by Biden. Monthly manufacturing construction spending rose from $77 million to $207 million between January 2021 and October 2023, a jump of 170 percent, according to census data. It’s progress that Biden has highlighted in his television ads this fall, talking about new manufacturing jobs, new green energy to lower power costs.

“For Joe Biden, it’s about restoring the sense of security working people deserve,” says one Biden spot that has run in Georgia.

The industrial park near the highway that cuts through Dalton has boomed since Qcells first opened there. Beside the first Qcells facility at the site, a second sleek, brightly lit warehouse has popped up, where workers are assembling commercial and residential solar panels with the help of automated machines.

“There are not other jobs similar in the area,” said Lisa Nash, general manager of the Qcells factory. “We can take high school students, people who have made other products, and if they have an aptitude, we can train them. And it’s upskilling.”

Other jobs have come downstream. Mary Sumner, who voted for Biden in 2020, recently started working for the local janitorial company that contracts with Qcells as an extra source of income aside from her job managing an apartment complex. She knows she is part of a minority in her family of 10 and hometown that would give any credit to Biden for anything positive, including the new source of money she receives.

“Four more years and there’s even better things to come,” Sumner said.

Jan Pourquoi, a Democrat and owner of a small Dalton carpet company, attended Harris’s visit to the site. When he looked around the room, he didn’t see anyone who lived in Dalton.

His neighbors and friends tell him they are worse off financially than they were under Trump and they believe Republicans are doing more to address immigration and drugs — or at least they seem to talk about it more. In the last local election, 9 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. In 2024, Pourquoi expects there won’t be any surge of voters supporting Biden, especially for the solar initiatives.

“There are more people aware of Qcells outside this area than in this area,” he said. “What it definitely will not do is change anything on the political dial.”

‘Everything has gone up in price’

Phoenix

Martha Isela Rodriguez remembers when she would go just once a week to buy her groceries at the Fry’s right around the corner from her house.

Now, she checks her mail daily to see the weekly ads with specials and coupons for grocery stores. El Rancho Market has deals on fruits and vegetables on Wednesdays and meat on Thursdays. On the weekend, Food City tends to have some good specials, too.

For Rodriguez, it has become the norm to visit three grocery stores a week — and even then, she’s still paying more than before.

Standing in the kitchen heating tortillas on a comal, a cast-iron skillet, Rodriguez recalled how she used to pay much less for groceries when Trump was president. Everything, from the chuletas de cerdo to the jalapeños she uses for her salsa, was cheaper. And that $380 electricity bill she just paid? It had never been so high, she remarked.

For her, all these higher costs spell trouble for Biden, who she voted for and knocked on doors to get elected in 2020. Her home county of Maricopa went for Trump in 2016 by under three percentage points and then backed Biden in 2020 by just over two percentage points. But she’s skeptical that Biden will win Arizona — or the 2024 election.

“Personally, I see it difficult for Biden to win. There’s already so many people who feel he hasn’t done anything, that the economy isn’t working,” Rodriguez, 48, said as she passed her 1-year-old granddaughter, Maria Daniela, an apple, mango and spinach baby food puree as a snack.

She was hearing it from her co-workers whom she had convinced to vote for Biden in 2020. Now, they either say they won’t vote this year or they’re considering backing Trump. They taunt her for pushing them to support Biden in 2020 — complaining to her about how bad inflation was under Biden and how he was letting in too many migrants and helping them when he wasn’t helping the undocumented immigrants already living here.

“They tell me things like, ‘Look at the gas. It hasn’t gone down at all since your Biden came into power.’ Your Biden, they tell me,” she said. “They say the same with a box of eggs or a gallon of milk. ‘Now that your Biden is around, the prices are up and the salaries don’t match it.’”

“And what can I say? Yes, it’s true,” she added. “Everything has gone up in price.”

Due to inflation, it cost an Arizona family over $2,700 a year more to purchase the same goods and services last August as it would have cost in August 2022, according to an analysis in September by the nonpartisan Common Sense Institute.

The sharpest increases came in distinct sectors, including gas prices, which rocketed higher in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, and have since fallen back to 2021 levels. The pain of those increases was felt especially in suburban and rural areas, where people like Rodriguez drive long distances on a daily basis.

Rodriguez said she knew it wasn’t necessarily Biden’s fault that inflation remained an issue in Phoenix, as she’d heard of it being a challenge globally. But she said she wished he would project more confidence and stability like Obama, the politician whom she said she became a U.S. citizen just to vote for. In her eyes, she said, Obama was handed a terrible economy after George W. Bush’s administration and was able to turn it around.

“Biden just doesn’t have that magic, that energy to get things done,” she said.

In a matchup between Biden and Trump, Rodriguez said she’ll vote for Biden again. It won’t be because he’s done a good job, she said, but because of just how strongly she dislikes Trump.

She added, however, that she doesn’t plan to repeat her election-year summer of knocking on doors in the Phoenix heat to get other Latinos out to vote for Biden this time."

While highlighting new and ongoing infrastructure investments across the country, President Joe Biden on Thursday continued to praise the recent GDP report that found the nation's economy grew at a 3.3% annual pace -- much more rapid than expected -- and he gave credit to Americans for an economy that has exceeded expectations.

""Thanks to the American people, America now has the strongest growth, the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world. It's because of you,"" he said at an event in Superior, Wisconsin.

The GDP report released Thursday found that in addition to the economy growing at an unexpectedly brisk pace, inflation has eased -- showing Americans' willingness to spend freely in the face of high interest rates and price levels. The latest data marked the sixth straight quarter where the GDP had grown at an annual pace of 2% or more.

Biden took a victory lap for overcoming predictions that a recession would happen since he came into office and the constant headlines warning one was around the corner. With a chuckle, he read the optimistic headlines on the strong fourth quarter.

""Here's this morning's headlines from the Wall Street Journal and other papers: 'U.S. shatters expectations.' Second headline: 'The U.S. economy boomed in 2023.' Third: 'U.S. economy grew at a shocking pace.' I love the 'shocking pace' bit,"" Biden said. ""But my favorite is from the Wall Street Journal: 'What recession? Growth ended accelerating in 2023.'""

As Biden gears up for the general election, he also emphasized how Americans are finally starting to feel better about the state of the economy, which will be a key issue for voters in November. He credited his policies for reaching an auspicious point with the economy.

""Just last week, we saw the biggest jump in 30 years and how positive consumers are feeling about the economy. Things are finally beginning to sink in,"" he said. ""We passed a lot of really good legislation. We knew it was going to take time for it to begin to take hold, but it's taken hold now in turning the economy around.""

And while he touted his successes, Biden also criticized former President Donald Trump over his recent comments that the former president hoped the economy would crash on Biden's watch.

Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Lou Dobbs that he wanted the economy to crash in the next year because ""I don't want to be Herbert Hoover.""

Biden questioned, ""can you believe it?""

""Well, he said he's hoping ... it happens soon while I'm still president. That's what he's hoping for,"" Biden said.

Though progress is being made, Biden said, ""we obviously have more work to do, but we're making real progress."""

President Joe Biden defended his handling of the economy hours after a key economic report found that progress on slowing inflation has stalled, a continued bane on Biden’s presidency.

US consumer prices picked up again last month, marking a 3.5% increase for the 12 months ended in March, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inflation has dogged the president and his approval ratings on the economy have suffered as prices have soared following the easing of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Biden pointed to success “dramatically” reducing the rate of inflation from 9% to 3% as he sought to convince Americans that “we’re better situated than we were when we took office, where inflation was skyrocketing.”

Inflation, however, began to rise in 2021 – Biden’s first year as president – as normalcy began to return to American life following the worst parts of the pandemic. It peaked in June 2022 as the rate of inflation reached 9.1%.

According to a CNN poll from earlier this year, a 55% majority of Americans overall say they feel Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, while just 26% believe his policies have improved conditions. Another 19% say they’ve had no effect – numbers that are nearly unchanged from the summer.

A near-universal 91% of Republicans say that Biden’s policies have worsened the economy, while a more modest 55% majority of Democrats say that his policies have improved things. Biden’s approval rating for handling the economy, which hasn’t broken the 40% mark since December 2021, currently stands at 37% among the full public.

Republicans, Biden said, have “no plan.”

“We have a plan to deal with it whereas the opposition – my opposition – talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people. And so I think they have no plan. Our plan is one, I think, is so sustainable,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden.

Wednesday’s report further highlights that the path to lower inflation remains extremely bumpy — and continue to be a drag on Americans’ finances — and that any loosening of monetary policy might not happen soon.

The president stood by his prediction that there will be a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, and that could happen “before the year is out,” though he cautioned that it could be delayed.

“We don’t know what the Fed is going to do for certain,” he reiterated.

US stocks tanked Wednesday after the release of the hotter-than-expected inflation data, with the blue-chip Dow falling by more than 500 points. The S&P 500 lost 1% and the Nasdaq Composite fell by 1%.

Fresh data this week shows inflation picked up again in March, in the latest sign that the economy is overheating. Unexpectedly strong job growth, wages and consumer spending are a plus for most Americans but bad for inflation. The higher inflation reading makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates — and mortgage rates — elevated until late in the year, possibly until days after the election, eluding much political gain for Biden.

“It’s really a case of bad luck,” said Karen Dynan, a professor at Harvard University and former Treasury Department chief economist. “The Biden administration has made some big strides but it’s up against one of the most disruptive economies in decades. Rate cuts would be a welcome development for a lot of people, but the prospects for cuts have really changed given what’s happening with inflation.”

Gasoline prices, in particular, have always played an outsize role in how Americans feel about the economy. The average price of a gallon of gas has been creeping up in the past two months to $3.63 a gallon on Friday, according to AAA. Fears of rising prices could already be weighing on Americans anew, as consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in April, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.

A booming economy can fuel inflation if spending is so robust that consumers are willing to pay ever-higher prices for goods and services. Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and so far Americans have been more than happy to splurge on services like dining out, travel and hotel stays, despite inflation. That’s forced businesses to ramp up hiring — and raise wages — which in turn pushes prices even higher.

Biden aides point out that the current inflation reading, at 3.5 percent, is below what it was at similar points in President Bill Clinton’s and President Ronald Reagan’s tenures, when year-on-year inflation was at 3.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. Both went on to win reelection.

“Our agenda to lower costs on behalf of working families is as urgent today as it was yesterday,” said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers. “We’re just going to keep our heads down and continue fighting to lower costs from prescription drugs to junk fees to housing and child care.”

For much of his presidency, Biden has struggled with his message on the economy. When inflation first started to beset the country in the months after the pandemic, the president and his team settled on describing it as “transitory,” trying to signal to voters that the spike was temporary and would subside. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House started using the phrase “Putin’s price hike,” blaming the war for rising gas prices.

As inflation dropped, Biden try to rebrand “Bidenomics,” originally used derisively by conservative media, in an attempt to gain credit from voters for a booming job market and growing economy. But as economists have struggled to explain the topsy-turvy economy after covid, Biden has struggled, too.

The president and his aides have been frustrated that they have not received more credit for avoiding a recession and passing massive legislation, specifically the infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act, which will transform the United States’ roads and bridges and turbocharge a domestic semiconductor industry. Aides have been divided over how to sell Biden’s legislative accomplishments while many Americans say they are having trouble affording groceries and other household items.

That dispute spilled into public view this week after Politico published audio of former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who remains close to Biden, criticizing the White House’s economic messaging. During a conference, Klain said Biden spends too much time touting new bridges and not enough on rising prices.

The White House says Biden can, and must, do both.

“He understands what the Americans are facing,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters this week when asked about Klain’s comments. “And he’s talked at almost every — every event that he’s had — crisscrossing the country after the State of the Union — about lowering costs, how important it is, and how there’s more work to do. You hear that.”

On Saturday, the White House put out a new memo on the economy, debuting a message centered on Trump, warning that if he’s reelected, inflation would climb higher.

“While President Biden’s vision for economic growth is based on strengthening the middle class, lowering prices, and defeating inflation, MAGAnomics is the opposite — a recipe for supercharging inflation and costs for the middle-class with policies that put the wealthy above everyone else,” Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, wrote in the memo.

But, as inflation heats back up, the White House is under renewed pressure to quell Americans’ economic anxieties. Stock markets tumbled this week as investors realized a rate cut was no longer imminent.

Bank of America this week said it does not expect the Fed to begin scaling back on interest rates until December, six months later than its original forecast. “We no longer think policymakers will gain the confidence they need to start cutting in June,” Michael Gapen, the bank’s U.S. economist said in an analyst note. It also expects the Fed to cut less than it had previously thought.

The president this week took the unusual step of commenting on the Fed’s next move, saying he stands by his prediction that the central bank will cut rates by the end of the year. Biden has generally been careful to keep his distance from the Fed, saying he respects the central bank’s independence.

In a twist, the election itself could delay the Fed’s plans. Investors generally expect the central bank to steer clear of policy changes in the lead-up to the presidential race, out of concern that it could be seen favoring one candidate over another.

“It’s hard to imagine the Fed cutting rates aggressively before November,” said Glenn Hubbard, a professor at Columbia Business School who served as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush. “I just don’t see it happening — that’s not a political judgment, it’s just arithmetic.”

Inflation, which peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022, has come down dramatically since then, with meaningful drops in just about every category of goods and services. In some cases, big-ticket items like cars, furniture and appliances, have actually gotten cheaper in the past year.

But in recent months, progress has petered out. Inflation picked up in March — with prices up 3.5 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 3.2 percent increase the month before. A range of basics — including car insurance, women’s coats, pork chops and visits to the vet — were about 3 percent more expensive than they were in February.

Chad Barrett, 36, who owns a solar-panel business in West Palm Beach, Fla., says inflation and high borrowing costs have forced him to reconsider his vote for Biden. Barrett, a lifelong Democrat who once campaigned for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), plans to cast a “protest vote,” either for a third-party candidate or a write-in.

Until this week, Barrett had been hopeful that the Fed would start lowering interest rates in the next couple of months, offering some relief. But that seems unlikely now — which means he’s already getting notices from lenders that his borrowing costs will go up soon.

“All I hear is, ‘This economy is great, it’s amazing,’ but I’m a millennial who doesn’t own a home and everything is going up in cost,” he said. “It’s a mix of disappointment and frustration.”

In his rematch against former president Donald Trump, Biden has increasingly tried to contrast his economic record with Trump’s.

“We’re in a situation where we’re better situated than we were when we took office where we — inflation was skyrocketing,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday. “And we have a plan to deal with it, whereas the opposition — my opposition talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people. And so, I think they’re — they have no plan. Our plan is one I think is still sustainable.”

As the president struggles to connect on the economy, though, his campaign is eager to focus on the issue of abortion. Democrats have found electoral success since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and they are spending millions of dollars to remind voters that Trump was the architect of that decision. As states around the country institute even more restrictive abortion bans, Democrats are optimistic the issue will outweigh the economy for core Democratic base voters, but also potentially disaffected Republicans.

In Fultonville, N.Y., Pam Marshall and her community have been hit hard by rising prices. But the single mom, who left the Republican Party after the Jan. 6 attack, says abortion rights take precedence over economic issues. She plans to vote for Biden in November."

National

West Long Branch, NJ – Just one-third of Americans feel they are benefitting from the current boom in the U.S. economy, a lower number than during the pre-Covid boom years. The Monmouth (“Mon-muth”) University Poll finds that just under half the public gives President Joe Biden credit for this upturn, but few say his policies are helping the middle class, especially compared to his predecessor. The poll also finds that disapproval of Congress has hit a nominal record for the past decade.

Recent economic indicators show the U.S. economy has been growing, including lower unemployment, higher productivity, and a high Dow Jones average. When asked about this economic upturn, about half of the public says Biden deserves credit for it (22% a great deal and 26% some credit) while half says he does not (14% not much and 36% not at all). Nine in 10 Democrats (89%) give the president at least some credit for the improving economy while just 1 in 10 Republicans (10%) say the same.

When asked whether their own family has been helped by this upturn, just one-third say they have personally benefited either a great deal (9%) or some (24%). At the opposite end of the spectrum, 40% of Americans say they have not benefited at all. These numbers were more positive when Monmouth asked this question before the pandemic. Between 2015 and 2019, the number of Americans who said their family benefited at least somewhat from national economic growth ranged from 39% (January 2015) to 50% (August 2018). Those who said they did not benefit at all was no higher than 29% (January 2015 and April 2018) and as low as 23% (January 2017).

Reports of how American families have been impacted by national economic growth has varied with partisanship over time. For example, the top-line results at the end of Barack Obama’s presidency and just past the halfway point in Donald Trump’s term were similar – 47% of the public reported at least some economic benefit in January 2017 and 43% said the same in April 2019. However, this overall stability masked significant partisan shifts between the two administrations. In the Obama era poll, 63% of Democrats said they were benefiting from national economic growth, while 42% of independents and 37% of Republicans said the same. Under Trump, just 27% of Democrats said they were benefiting from the economy, while it was higher among independents (44%) and especially Republicans (61%). According to the current poll, 61% of Democrats say they are benefiting from the economic growth during Biden’s term, but just 27% of independents and 14% of Republicans agree.

“When it comes to making a connection between the national economy and Americans’ own well-being, Biden is doing about as well as Obama did among his fellow Democrats and similar to how Trump performed among Republicans. The problem for Biden is he is doing decidedly worse than either of his two predecessors among independents,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

Looking at how Biden’s policies have affected different economic groups shows that 16% of Americans say middle-class families in general have benefited a lot, 21% say poor families have benefited a lot, and 41% say wealthy families have benefited a lot. Conversely, 45% say middle-class families have not benefited at all from Biden’s policies, 40% say the same about poor families and 19% say the same about wealthy families. Compared to prior Monmouth polling, there has been some improvement for Biden on these numbers for middle-class and poor families, but the biggest difference has been in perceptions of how wealthy families have been affected. The number who say the wealthy have been helped a lot rose by 13 percentage points since 2022. Perceptions of how Biden has helped wealthy families is not quite as high as it was for Trump during his term (58% said the wealthy were benefiting a lot in 2019). More importantly, though, Biden’s numbers are slightly worse than Trump’s when it comes to helping middle-class families. About the same number say the middle class has been helped a lot by Biden as said the same for Trump in 2019 (18%), but the number who feel this group has not been helped at all is nine points higher for Biden than it was for his predecessor (36%). Also, when it comes to helping poor families, Biden does better than Trump, but much worse than Obama.

“The administration can beat the drum on all sorts of positive economic news. From the standpoint of Biden’s presidential campaign, however, if voters don’t think this bounty is reaching the middle class then that can become the economic ‘fact’ which matters most,” said Murray.

Public opinion of Biden’s overall job performance currently stands at 38% approve and 58% disapprove. This represents a slight improvement from Monmouth’s December poll which marked an all-time low for Biden since taking office (34% approve and 61% disapprove), but it continues an overall negative trend since last summer. Biden’s job rating went from net positive to net negative in the fall of 2021 and continued to worsen into the summer of 2022. It slowly started to rebound through the remainder of the year, but then grew more negative after January 2023 when he held a 43% approve and 48% disapprove rating. Currently, 79% of Democrats give Biden a positive job rating, but only 29% of independents and just 4% of Republicans do the same.

A majority of Americans disapprove of the way Biden has handled five different policy areas, while he earns a split decision on employment. Specifically, 48% approve and 49% disapprove of his handling of jobs and unemployment. This is somewhat better than his 42% approve and 53% disapprove rating on this policy area in December. The president’s policy ratings are more negative on transportation and energy infrastructure (43% approve, 53% disapprove) and climate change (41% approve, 53% disapprove). He gets decidedly poor ratings on handling inflation (34% approve, 63% disapprove), foreign policy (33% approve, 65% disapprove), and immigration (26% approve, 71% disapprove).

Biden’s approval number on inflation is six points better than in December (28%), while he has inched up 3 points on climate change (from 38%). His approval ratings on infrastructure and immigration are basically the same as they were two months ago (at 42% and 26%, respectively). Foreign policy was not asked in the December poll.

Among independents, 45% give Biden positive marks on handling jobs and unemployment, while 33% each approve of his performance on infrastructure and climate change. At least 8 in 10 Democrats approve of Biden’s handling of these three issues, while fewer than 1 in 10 Republicans say the same. Among Democrats, 71% approve of how Biden has handled inflation, 65% approve of his foreign policy efforts, and a bare majority (54%) approve of his work on immigration. No more than 1 in 4 independents and very few Republicans approve of Biden’s handling of these three issues.

On another topic, the U.S. Congress receives an abysmal job rating of 14% approve and 79% disapprove. This disapproval level is nominally the worst congressional rating since Monmouth started asking this question nationally in 2013. The current result just edges out statistically similar 78% disapproval ratings recorded in both June 2022 and August 2016. The current poll’s congressional approval rating matches the prior record low of 14% (from August 2016 and July 2013). Disapproval of Congress is widespread across all partisan groups, including 82% of Republicans, 82% of independents, and 74% of Democrats.

“One thing that Americans of all partisan stripes seem to agree upon is that Congress is broken,” said Murray.

In other poll results, Vice President Kamala Harris receives a job rating of 35% approve and 58% disapprove, which is basically unchanged from polls taken since the fall. Only 17% of the public says the country is going in the right direction, while 69% say it is on the wrong track. Democrats are split between saying the country is heading in the right (36%) or wrong (40%) direction, while nearly all Republicans (95%) and most independents (73%) feel things have gotten off on the wrong track.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from February 8 to 12, 2024 with 902 adults in the United States. The question results in this release have a margin of error of +/- 4.1 percentage points for the full sample. The poll was conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, NJ.

METHODOLOGY

The Monmouth University Poll was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from February 8 to 12, 2024 with a probability-based national random sample of 902 adults age 18 and older. Interviews were conducted in English, and included 183 live landline telephone interviews, 362 live cell phone interviews, and 357 online surveys via a cell phone text invitation. Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of random digit dialing and list-based sampling. Landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter youngest adult household screen. Interviewing services were provided by Braun Research, with sample obtained from Dynata (RDD, n= 557), Aristotle (list, n= 152) and a panel of prior Monmouth poll participants (n= 193). Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on US Census information (ACS 2021 one-year survey). For results based on this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points adjusted for sample design effects (1.56). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.

This charticle preemptively assesses the state of the U.S. economy by looking at some of the key indicators of aggregate economic health. Overall, the data suggest that the U.S. economy is strong and poised to continue growing.

First, let’s look at scarring, or the permanent damage to the economy caused by recessions. The economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been rocky at times, but 3.5 years after the official end of the recession, the U.S. economy accomplished a remarkable feat: It completely avoided scarring (which economists also call hysteresis).

By contrast, the Great Recession of 2007–2009 caused lasting damage to the U.S. economy. Figure 1 shows how the U.S. economy contracted to well below levels forecasted by the Congressional Budget Office before the recession and stayed depressed for the length of the recovery. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1

Meanwhile, the post-pandemic U.S. economy has now caught up to—and exceeded—CBO projections of Gross Domestic Product from before the COVID-19 recession. (See Figure 2.)

Figure 2

Scarring can be particularly harmful for young workers who are looking for employment for the first time. Research shows that these workers face long-lasting negative impacts from graduating into a poor labor market. Even 10 years later, these workers have lower wages, higher chances of unemployment, and worse health outcomes than their peers. So, it’s especially encouraging that young U.S. workers have fared well in the post-pandemic economic recovery: Unemployment for 16- to 24-year-olds is at its lowest level in decades. (See Figure 3.)

Figure 3

Moreover, the Atlanta Federal Reserve finds that these same workers saw significant wage increases after the pandemic. Strong wage growth for these workers suggests they have avoided the labor market scarring that usually impacts young workers after a recession. (See Figure 4.)

Figure 4

These wage gains are primarily attributable to a tight U.S. labor market that has pulled more workers into the labor market. Prime-age women’s labor force participation rates are at historic highs, for example. Additionally, the gap in unemployment between White and Black workers is at its lowest point since both rates have been measured. (See Figure 5.)

Figure 5

Much of this success can be attributed to the strength of consumption in the U.S. economy. Thanks in large part to aggressive fiscal policy during the pandemic, Americans emerged from lockdown with money to spend—and they are spending it. Consumption should remain strong as wage growth is now outpacing inflation for most workers. (See Figure 6.)

Figure 6

According to the New York Federal Reserve, consumer debt also remains low by historical standards. Although credit card delinquency has crept up lately, it is within normal levels historically, and delinquencies for other types of debt are at extremely low levels. (See Figure 7.)

Figure 7

Taken together, the aggregate data paints the picture of a strong economy, with relatively few threats on the horizon. After months of erroneous recession speculation over the past couple of years, the indicators clearly show that the state of the U.S. economy is strong."

Biden trails GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on major policy and personal comparisons, including by more than 20 points on which candidate would better handle the economy. And Biden’s deficit versus Trump on handling immigration and the border is greater than 30 points.

The poll also shows Trump holding a 16-point advantage over Biden on being competent and effective, a reversal from 2020, when Biden was ahead of Trump on this quality by 9 points before defeating him in that election.

And Biden’s approval rating has declined to the lowest level of his presidency in NBC News polling — to 37% — while fewer than 3 in 10 voters approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

All together, these numbers explain why the poll shows Trump leading Biden by 5 points among registered voters in a hypothetical 2024 general-election matchup, 47% to 42%. While the result is within the poll’s margin of error, the last year of polling shows a clear shift.

Perhaps the best news in the poll for Biden is that he pulls ahead of Trump when voters are asked about their ballot choice if the former president is convicted of a felony. Yet the margin then is just 2 points in Biden’s favor, also within the margin of error.

Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his team at Public Opinion Strategies, says these findings reveal “a presidency in peril.”

“What is most concerning is the erosion of Biden’s standing against Trump compared to four years ago,” Horwitt said. “On every measure compared to 2020, Biden has declined. Most damning, the belief that Biden is more likely to be up to the job — the chief tenet of the Biden candidacy — has evaporated.”

McInturff, the GOP pollster, adds: “It is hard to imagine a more difficult set of numbers before a re-election.”

But Horwitt said that Biden still has time to change voters’ perceptions.

“Biden can take solace that we are in January and not October 2024. At this stage in prior cycles, attitudes can change,” he said.

The NBC News poll, conducted Jan. 26-30, comes after Trump won his party’s presidential nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth month, and amid positive news on the U.S. economy, including growing consumer confidence and more than 300,000 jobs created last month.

(The poll, however, was conducted before the U.S. military launched strikes Friday in retaliation for the killings of three U.S. service members in Jordan.)

“Inflation is coming down. Jobs are growing. We created 800,000 manufacturing jobs,” Biden boasted in Michigan on Thursday.

Despite those statistics, Trump holds a 22-point advantage over Biden on the question of which candidate would do a better job handling the economy, with 55% picking Trump and 33% choosing Biden.

When this question was last asked in October 2020 — a month before Biden’s victory over Trump — the then-president held only a 7-point advantage over Biden, 48% to 41%.

That said, the poll shows improving attitudes about the economy, with the share of voters believing the economy will get worse in the next year declining 14 points since October 2022.

Also in the poll, Trump has the edge on securing the border and controlling immigration (35 points over Biden), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (+23), on dealing with crime and violence (+21), on being competent and effective (+16), and on improving America’s standing in the world (+11).

Biden holds advantages over Trump on dealing with abortion (+12) and protecting immigrant rights (+17).

The two men are essentially tied on the issue of protecting democracy, with 43% of voters preferring Biden and 41% picking Trump.

Biden’s approval rating falls to new low

The NBC News poll also finds Biden’s overall approval rating dropping to the lowest point of his presidency, with 37% of registered voters approving and 60% disapproving — down from November’s score of 40% approving, 57% disapproving.

Biden’s current approval rating is the lowest for any president in the NBC News poll since George W. Bush’s second term.

In the new poll, Biden’s approval rating has declined especially among Latinos (just 35% of them now approve of his job performance), voters ages 18-34 (29%) and independents (27%).

Additionally, 36% of voters in the poll approve of Biden’s handling of the economy (down 2 points from November), 34% approve of his handling of foreign policy (down 1 point) and 29% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza (down 5 points).

Among voters under 35 years old, only 15% approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, while a whopping 70% disapprove.

“A major through line in what ails Biden most are his travails with younger voters,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.

Measuring a Biden-Trump rematch

In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup in November’s presidential contest, Trump gets support from 47% of registered voters, versus 42% who back Biden.

That 5-point lead for Trump — within the poll’s margin of error — is up from November’s 2-point advantage for Trump, 46% to 44%.

It’s consistent with other recent polling, including CNN’s national survey and battleground-state polls from Bloomberg News and Morning Consult. But a recent national Quinnipiac University poll found Biden with a 6-point lead over Trump, 50% to 44%. Overall, national surveys point to a divided country in a testy mood — and a highly contested election on the horizon.

In the new NBC News poll, Biden holds the advantage over Trump among Black voters (75% to 16%), women (50% to 40%) and white people with college degrees (50% to 42%).

Trump, meanwhile, has leads among white people without college degrees (62% to 29%), men (56% to 34%) and independents (48% to 29%).

The two men are essentially tied among Latinos (Trump 42%, Biden 41%) and voters ages 18-34 (at 42% each). Among the youngest slice of voters measured, those ages 18-29, Biden has a narrow advantage (Biden 46%, Trump 38%).

But when the poll re-asks voters — on the survey’s final question — about their ballot choice if Trump is found guilty and convicted of a felony this year, the picture shifts. Biden jumps ahead of Trump among registered voters in that case, 45% to 43%. (Read more here.)

Testing Biden, Trump and third parties

In a hypothetical matchup featuring third parties, Trump’s advantage over Biden grows to 6 points, 41% to 35% — with an unnamed Libertarian Party candidate getting 5% support, an unnamed Green Party candidate getting another 5% and an unnamed No Labels candidate getting 4%.

(While the poll didn’t test a ballot including independent presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, who are still seeking state ballot access across the country, it finds 34% of all registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy and 10% saying the same of West.)

And in a hypothetical matchup featuring Biden and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the NBC News poll shows Haley leading Biden by 9 points, 45% to 36%.

Trump leads Haley by 60 points in GOP race

As for Haley and the GOP presidential race after Iowa and New Hampshire, the poll has Trump leading his former U.N. ambassador by a whopping 60 points among national GOP primary voters, 79% to 19%.

In a separate question, 61% of these Republican voters say Trump should continue as the party’s leader; 14% say Trump was a good president, but it’s time to consider other leaders; and 22% say the GOP needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach.

The NBC News poll was conducted Jan. 26-30 of 1,000 registered voters — 867 contacted via cellphone — and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. The margin of error for the 349 Republican primary voters is plus-minus 5.25 percentage points."

Growth was surprisingly strong last year. And once-hot inflation has begun to cool. But so far, U.S. adults are feeling only slightly better about the economy.

A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 35% of U.S. adults call the national economy good. That’s an uptick from 30% who said so late last year and up from 24% who said so a year ago. While 65% still call the economy poor, that’s also an improvement from a year ago, when 76% called it poor.

Voters’ confidence in the economy could be a pivotal factor in this year’s presidential election as it is consistently rated as a top issue. Recent data on the economy has shown that growth accelerated last year even as inflation returned closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, proving wrong a multitude of Wall Street and academic economists who said a recession would be the consequence of efforts to lower inflation.

President Joe Biden and his aides have taken to highlighting the economic positives as consumer sentiment has rebounded. Biden is also drawing an open contrast with former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner. Trump supporters remember his tenure with pride for how the economy fared, but his term was marred by job losses tied to the coronavirus pandemic.

The evidence of a stronger economy has yet to spill over into greater support for Biden. The new poll puts his approval rating at 38%, which is roughly where that number has stood for most of the past two years. Biden’s approval rating on handling the economy is similar, at 35%.

Respondents interviewed for the survey often expressed their views on the economy through a personal lens. Some judged it based on their grocery bills and prices at the gasoline pump. Others assessed the economy based on their appreciating investments. Housing prices mattered, and so did job prospects for their adult children and the upward trajectory of the federal debt.

Molly Kapsner, 58, lives on a farm in Wisconsin and thinks the economy is doing “pretty well” because she has three children finishing college this year and all of them have job options. She voted for Biden in 2020 and plans to do so again.

“He has a lot on his plate right now and he’s doing quite well,” she said. “He’s just putting his head down and doing his job and not trying to create a circus in our country.”

David Veksler, who voted for the libertarian candidate, Jo Jorgenson, in 2020, said he’s worried about the rising federal debt. The 43-year-old software engineer manager from Denver said the borrowing will hurt growth in the long term, even if his investments are doing well now.

“I think he’s similar to his predecessors in furthering unsustainable deficits,” Veksler said of Biden. “I’m as negative on him as I was on Trump.”

Harry Broadnax, a 62-year-old retiree, said he increasingly thinks about the economy in relation to the increase in migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border. He feels their presence is diverting financial resources from U.S. citizens.

“I would like to see them block up the border like Trump wanted,” said Broadnax, who is from North Carolina, adding for emphasis, “I’m a Democrat.”

Broadnax doesn’t see himself voting for Biden or Trump, whose criminal indictments worry him.

The Biden administration has tried to put a greater focus on the big numbers used to assess the overall economy, making its case through hard data.

Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, told a group of reporters last week that skeptics about the economy had overlooked how Biden’s policies boosted the labor market and repaired supply chains wrecked by the pandemic.

“The big miss here was not to understand how much, by surging back into the workforce, by addressing supply chains that were completely broken, those inflationary pressures would come down,” she said.

Trump has said that the economy is “fragile” and “running off the fumes of what we did.” The Republican front-runner has said on social media that stocks are rising because he is likely to return to the White House. That claim overlooks the influence of the Fed, as well as the fact that average annual growth has been higher under Biden so far than it was during Trump’s term.

There continues to be a political split in how people think about the economy. As a consequence, there might be a limit on how much Biden’s approval numbers can climb even if the economy keeps thriving as it did last year.

Democrats remain far more likely than Republicans to describe the economy as good, 58% to 15%. Still, views have improved at least slightly since the same time last year, when 41% of Democrats and 8% of Republicans called the economy good.

Sixty-five percent of Democrats, but just 7% of Republicans, say they approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, both largely unchanged since late last year.

However, the poll did show a brighter outlook on the economy from some key voter demographics. Since a year ago, a disproportionate increase in sentiment has come from college graduates and older adults — two groups that tend to turn out to vote at higher rates. There is also the possibility that voters will care more about the personalities of the Democratic and Republican nominees than they do about the state of the economy.

Deborah Shields, 70, who works in direct sales, said she’s noticed an improvement in the economy as her investments have improved. Yet she said her opposition to Trump will determine her vote in November.

“I would never, never, ever vote for Trump,” said Shields, who lives in Orlando, Florida. “He’s a megalomaniac.”

Richard Tunnell, an Air Force veteran on disability, voted for Trump in 2020 and would do so again if the former president is on the ballot. The 30-year-old from Huntsville, Texas is a hard “no” on Biden.

“He’s just a puppet,” Tunnell said. “They’ll boot people out like Trump who give a crap, but they’ll put in people like Biden who they can put on strings and manipulate.”

The messaging effort reflects a renewed confidence among Biden’s economic brain trust in the resilience of the U.S. economy and the president’s stewardship, after the administration was relentlessly hammered for more than two years over high inflation and widespread predictions of an imminent recession. On Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the nation’s economy grew by 2.5 percent over the course of the last year, including a robust annual rate of 3.3 percent in the most recent quarter.

“The U.S. economy is on a very desirable path,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen told reporters at the Treasury Department on Wednesday. “And my expectation is, in spite of the fact that there are always risks, the economy is doing very, very well.”

Aiming to capitalize on the strong data, Yellen delivered a landmark address in Chicago on Thursday aimed at both defending the administration’s economic record thus far and beginning to outline its plans for a second-term agenda. In prepared remarks, Yellen rebuked the forecasters who “thought a recession last year was inevitable.” She also touted low gas prices, a jump in consumer sentiment, rising wealth relative to pre-pandemic levels, a decline in the gap between rural and urban unemployment, caps on some drug prices, and some other signs of economic improvement.

“It’s been the fairest recovery on record,” Yellen said, according to her prepared remarks. “The recovery we’ve had — instead of one that was weaker or less fair — meant that we avoided financial pain for most middle-class American families.”

Speaking in Wisconsin on Thursday, Biden similarly said: “I don’t want to bore you all with detail, but, you know, the experts, from the time I got elected, were insisting that a recession was just around the corner. Every month, there was going to be a recession. Well, you know, we’ve got really strong growth.”

The administration’s posture comes amid a broader rethinking of the politics of the U.S. economy, which once appeared to be former president Donald Trump’s most effective weapon in the 2024 presidential campaign. Although Republicans remain optimistic the economy is still a potent winning message — particularly given the administration’s initial attempts to downplay price hikes in 2021 and 2022 — the GOP’s economic case has certainly gotten more difficult, as inflation has fallen from around 9 percent to closer to 3 percent.

Some analysts stress that risks remain to the economy, and there is still a chance that inflation reaccelerates.

“There’s no question about it that the data at the end of this morning were fantastic. The economy has embarrassed people who have called for recessions, and it embarrassed people who called for an end to inflation too early,” said Stephen Miran, who served as an economic analyst at the Treasury Department in the Trump administration. “But it’s premature to be celebrating just yet — inflation risks are real, and recession risks are still real. It’s hard to imagine the economy can have tight labor and housing markets and not see real inflation risks.”

Still, the White House is also growing more assertive in its messaging on the economy. On Thursday, the White House Council of Economic Advisers released a report showing that the “blue chip” index of top economic forecasters had badly misjudged the direction of the economy, projecting much higher inflation and unemployment than turned out to be the case.

“The data tell a compelling story of an economy that has significantly defied expectations, and where persistently tight labor markets and easing price pressures are supporting macroeconomic growth,” the report stated."

Consumer confidence is surging.

The stock market has soared to all-time highs.

And on Friday came a robust jobs report, with the U.S. economy adding 353,000 jobs in January, according to the Labor Department − nearly twice what was projected.

President Joe Biden's struggle to convince Americans of an improving economy amid stubborn inflation was long considered one of his biggest liabilities as he seeks reelection this fall, likely in a rematch against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.

Yet the repeated good news on the economic front − capped by Friday's blockbuster jobs report − suggests the tide could be turning, potentially making the economy a strength for Biden by the time of the November election.

""The economy is about as good as it gets,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, adding that even the one blemish − inflation that is ""still stinging"" − is becoming less painful. ""I think with each passing month, his case will strengthen,"" Zandi said of Biden, ""and people's perceptions will align more with his message.""

The economy has long been a weakness for Biden in polls, with surveys showing disapproval among Americans about his handling of it. Part of the reason for that has been a starkly uneven recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic.

Wealthier households have reaped more of the benefits of the economic improvement. Meanwhile, middle-class and low-income Americans have suffered the brunt of the pain from higher prices for groceries and other goods. And high student debt burdens and climbing housing prices have combined to reinforce the economic anxiety for many households.

Former Trump official: Report is a jobs 'blowout'

But January's jobs gains shattered economists' projections that 185,000 jobs were added last month. The unemployment rate held steady at a low 3.7%, marking 24 months of unemployment below 4%, the longest streak since the 1960s. The U.S. economy has now added 14.8 million jobs since Biden took office − a gain of 5.4 million more jobs than before the Covid-19 pandemic.

""America’s economy is the strongest in the world. Today, we saw more proof,"" Biden said in a statement.

More:Donald Trump says he hopes economy tanks this election year 'because I don't want to be Herbert Hoover'

Even Larry Kudlow, former director of the National Economic Council in the Trump administration, called it ""a blowout"" jobs report, despite Republicans' continued criticism on Biden over the economy.

""I know many of my conservative friends are trying to drill holes in this report,"" Kudlow said on Fox News. ""But you know what, folks? It is what it is. It's a very strong report. Not every economic stat should be viewed through a political lens.""

The U.S. gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., expanded by 2.5% last year, more than any advanced economy in the world last year, according to an International Monetary Fund analysis released this week. The U.S. economy is expected to grow faster than all other nations this year as well.

Meanwhile, the stock market has been on a steady rise for months, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average eclipsing 38,000 for the first time ever. It's so strong that Trump − who predicted a market collapse if Biden won the 2020 election − now wants credit, telling his supporters this week that the hot stock market is the result of investors predicting a Trump victory in the fall.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates mocked Trump in response, saying ""we welcome the wide range of ideologically diverse voices conceding that President Biden is delivering an economy that actually delivers for hardworking families − not just billionaires or executives in multinational corporations.""

Consumers growing more confident about easing inflation

The improving economic trends aren't entirely new.

For the past year, the White House has sought credit for a robust jobs market and growing economy, dubbing Biden's economic agenda ""Bidenomics."" But Biden has been unable to calm economic anxieties because of primarily one reason: high inflation.

Although inflation has slowed significantly since reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it has been a winding path downward. Consumer prices edged up to 3.4% in December compared to a year ago, up from 3.1% in November. The cost of services such as rent, car repairs and auto insurance have moved higher.

But there are new signs that Americans are becoming less concerned about inflation.

Consumer sentiment has climbed 29% over the past two months, the largest two-month increase since 1991, according to the University of Michigan's frequently cited survey of consumers. It's the result largely of an improved outlook over inflation and personal finances. The consumer confidence index is now 60% higher than the all-time low measured in June 2022 and at its highest level since July 2021.

""It's rare to see this level of agreement across the population and across different aspects of the economy,"" said Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's consumer index survey. She said consumers were reserving judgment in the fall whether the inflation slowdown would stick. ""Now with so many months of sustained slowdown in inflation, I think consumers are finally starting to feel assured. They are ready to take a breath.""

Moody's Analytics forecasts a Biden win based on economy

A Quinnipiac University poll this week found Biden leading Trump 50%-44% nationally among registered voters, expanding what was a 1-point Biden lead by the same pollster in December. Importantly, it found Biden leading independent voters who will be crucial in deciding the 2024 election 52%-40%.

A majority of voters, 55%, said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy, compared to 42% who said they approve. Yet it marked a slight improvement from Quinnipiac's December poll, which found only 39% approved of Biden's handling of the economy.

""Things are finally beginning to sink in,"" Biden, reflecting on the surge in consumer confidence, said during a stop last week in Superior, Wisconsin. ""We passed a lot of really good legislation. We knew it was going to take time for it to begin to take hold. But it's taken hold now and turning the economy around.""

Still, consumer sentiment remains 7% below the historic average, according to the University of Michigan survey, suggesting many Americans still want to see lasting economic improvements before their anxiety eases.

And with the exception of the Quinnipiac poll, Biden still trails Trump in the majority of head-to-head polls and in several key battleground states.

Nevertheless, Moody's Analytics projected a narrow Biden victory over Trump in its presidential election model released Thursday. The forecast is based on economic conditions of the country that are historically key election indicators − such as gas prices, household income, mortgage rates and consumer confidence − in addition to political factors.

""Biden has an advantage because he has the economy at his back,"" Zandi said. ""There's an economic tailwind to his reelection bid. If everything sticks to our script, it will only intensify as we approach the election. The economy is going to continue to perform well. And by Election Day, I think that will resonate more soundly with with voters.""

Biden spoke at a Boys and Girls Club of Greater Milwaukee in a largely Black and Latino neighborhood where 17,000 homes and 1,000 businesses were destroyed in the 1960s to make way for an interstate highway. The president’s trip, which includes a stop in Michigan on Thursday, is part of an effort to court minority voters in states that are key to his political future.

In conjunction with the Midwestern swing, the White House unveiled $3.3 billion in federal grants to remove or retrofit highways that separate minority neighborhoods in many cities from jobs, entertainment centers, hospitals and other services.

“Too many communities across America faced the loss of land, wealth and possibilities that still reverberate today,” Biden said. “Today we’re recognizing that history to make new history.”

Milwaukee is one of 132 communities in 40 states that will benefit from the Transportation Department program, which is among a number of new federal initiatives designed to aid places suffering long-term economic ills, officials said.

“For communities too often left behind, we’re rebuilding the roads, we’re repairing cracks in the sidewalk,” Biden said. “We’re creating places to live and play safely and to breathe clean air.”

Biden’s embrace of strategies aimed at spurring development in specific locations marks a significant shift in U.S. policy, part of the broadest government intervention in the economy in at least four decades and one with significant political overtones. States such as Wisconsin are critical to Democratic hopes in November, and Biden’s appeal to Milwaukee’s large number of Black voters may decide his fate there.

The administration’s “place-based” approach aims to use a mix of spending and tax credits to spread prosperity more evenly, rebuild communities devastated by the loss of factory jobs and prevent blight in areas that otherwise would suffer during the transition to cleaner energy sources.

If it succeeds, the effort could in theory help heal an economic divide that has fueled political resentment and convinced millions of Americans that Washington has abandoned them to decay.

“People and capital are trapped in places where the prospects are not that good,” said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This is a big country with a lot of space. Let’s have economic development where people want it.”

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, previewing the program earlier in the week, told reporters that “the very fact that American English has the phrase ‘wrong side of the tracks’ tells you everything you need to know about our awareness in this country of how infrastructure can divide just as sure as it can connect.”

But in seeking to focus federal power on reviving downtrodden communities, the president is gambling on a set of policies with a mixed track record. Even its supporters acknowledge that Washington may struggle to sustain the decades-long effort that some distressed areas would require to heal.

“This is just not something that happens overnight. We should be thinking of this in a multigenerational context,” said John Lettieri, chief executive of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan think tank that, among other things, focuses on economically distressed areas.

The political stakes for Biden’s visit to Milwaukee were also evident. His campaign announced this week that it was basing its Wisconsin operation in Milwaukee, the most racially diverse city in the state, part of an effort to consolidate the coalition that helped Biden win Wisconsin by nearly 21,000 votes in 2020.

Biden has made addressing racial inequity a key aspect of his presidency, and now his reelection bid. He was elected in 2020, after the killing of George Floyd, amid calls for criminal justice, education and policing reforms.

Biden, facing energetic opposition from Republicans, has failed to push through several bills of widespread importance to Black Americans and other minority groups. There has been no sweeping police and criminal justice reform, and efforts to codify voting protections into federal law died in Congress. Biden did sign an executive order in 2022 aimed at preventing and punishing police misconduct.

His aides say the administration has delivered other gains, including historic appointments to the courts, including that of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and the selection of Vice President Harris as the first Black and Asian American woman in her role. Biden has also said that equity is baked into individual provisions of laws like the Inflation Reduction Act.

On Wednesday, he stressed his initiatives that have disproportionately benefited Black Americans, everything from capping the price of insulin for Medicare recipients to increasing the Black employment rate. Former president Donald Trump and his Republican allies, Biden said, are trying to undo much of the progress his administration had made in recent years.

Even as he battles for political support, the president is also intent on cementing his economic legacy. His industrial policies, including the place-based efforts, have reoriented Washington toward a more active economic role.

About 20 individual programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips and Science Act are likely to sprinkle tens of billions of dollars across the economy over the next half-decade, the largest such geographically focused effort in years.

“This is a sea change,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Many of the programs, especially those aimed at promoting domestic semiconductor production, enjoy bipartisan support. But lawmakers have not always fully funded them.

The Chips Act, for example, authorized $10 billion in funding over five years to establish 31 tech hubs in communities across the country, an effort to promote technology development outside Silicon Valley and other longtime industry centers.

But lawmakers ultimately appropriated just $500 million for the hubs. In October, the Commerce Department named sites in 32 states as eligible to apply to receive the first implementation grants of $40 million to $70 million each.

Economists long favored targeting people rather than places for government help. But that began to change as the shared growth of the immediate post-World War II era gave way to a more uneven pattern. Some hard-hit areas — like former coal-mining towns and factory communities in the Midwest — have now suffered for years with low employment rates and chronic social ills.

Wednesday’s presidential visit to Milwaukee was part of an all-hands-on-deck administration effort to promote Biden’s economic policies, as the president faces pressure to improve his poll numbers in coming months. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, for example, traveled to Elizabethtown, Ky., visiting Advanced Nano Products, a maker of materials used in electric-vehicle batteries.

White House officials distinguish Biden’s approach from what they call the failed “trickle-down” policies of the past. Emphasizing low tax rates and deregulation, while trusting the market to allocate capital to worthy projects, resulted in growth that was markedly lopsided, they said.

An approach centered instead on leveraging the advantages of specific communities will narrow the regional divide in economic outcomes, the officials contend. Over the past few decades, as innovative technologies drove growth, jobs and wealth have become more concentrated in a few coastal cities while other areas languished.

Between 2005 and 2017, according to Brookings, about 90 percent of all high-tech jobs sprouted in five metro areas: Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and San Diego.

Americans who once routinely moved in search of opportunity also became significantly less mobile as the high cost of housing in job-rich places often made relocation prohibitively expensive.

In 2022, just 8.7 percent of Americans moved — close to an all-time low and down from more than 20 percent in the mid-1980s, according to the Census Bureau.

“The market failure, we think, is pretty clear,” said a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the initiative before it was formally announced.

Biden’s approach seeks to help downtrodden communities by improving outdated roads, bridges and telecom connections; attracting private funds to invest alongside the government; and eliminating physical barriers to opportunities, such as the interstate highways that were plowed through many African American neighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s.

Officials say they intend to “stack” or combine multiple federal initiatives in individual locations in hopes of overwhelming entrenched problems. In a recent speech, the director of the National Economic Council, Lael Brainard, cited Milwaukee and Allentown, Pa., as evidence of early success.

These place-based strategies echo moments from the nation’s past, such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1933 legislation establishing the Tennessee Valley Authority, which spurred regional development with electrification and flood control. In the 1960s, the Appalachian Regional Commission helped spur highway construction across one of the nation’s poorest areas.

“TVA and ARC both worked. Of course, they were a sizable amount of resources,” said Tim Bartik, senior economist with the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research."

CNN —

If Punxsutawney Phil saw no shadow, suggesting an early spring, will Americans look at these new bonkers jobs numbers and begin to warm up to “Bidenomics?”

Americans have for years expressed a general discomfort with the state of the economy, which has helped drag down President Joe Biden’s objectively pathetic approval rating. Despite gloomy perceptions of the economy, people have not stopped spending money, which has buoyed many of the economic indicators that please policymakers.

Evidence of a strong economy has so far been lost on a general public that still feels the pinch of inflation and worries about the uncertainty of life in 2024.

Jobs, jobs, jobs

Data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged US job growth at 353,000 jobs in January, a stunning figure that doubled economists’ projections. The unemployment rate held at 3.7% and has now been under 4% for two full years.

Employment data is but one indicator. There are others to choose from. The S&P 500, the stock index that tracks the largest publicly traded companies, has been on a record-setting tear, strengthening the balances of many people’s 401(k)s.

Not enough credit, too much blame

The old political adage is that presidents get too much blame for bad economies and not enough credit for strong economies.

The coming general election, shaping up to be a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, offers voters alternate realities to choose from.

Biden and his surrogates are bragging about the economy and trying to convince voters that “Bidenomics,” a term the administration’s embraced, is working.

Trump wants credit for Biden’s economy

Trump, meanwhile has said the economy would tumble and hopes it will happen on Biden’s watch rather than his own. He said the stock market is booming because of the prospect of his victory. And he’s promoting conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve considering rate cuts to favor Biden.

Instead, as inflation has cooled, the Fed has held rates steady, as it did this week, and transmitted that people should not expect rate cuts in March either.

Everyone from investors to progressive senators are hoping for rate cuts to give people cheaper access to borrowed money and, among other things, unlock the real estate market. But Fed officials clearly want to be more certain that inflation is more under control. Their target for inflation is 2%, and recent reports suggest prices have steadied.

Predicted recession has not come

Rather than suffer the recession that was widely predicted coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy had a shockingly strong year in 2023 and is expected to grow at an even stronger 4.2% rate in the first quarter.

But that doesn’t mean things are getting cheaper. Americans are still feeling the pinch at the grocery store and everywhere else they spend money.

Signs of a thaw in public opinion, but pessimism still dominates

A new CNN poll shows Biden still has a lot of convincing to do: Perception of the economy remains deep under water. But the mood is heading in a positive direction – which should come as a relief to Biden, because the economy is one of his weakest issues, according to favorability polls.

However, if hiring remains strong and inflation keeps falling, it may become easier for Biden to convince voters he’s doing a good job strengthening the economy.

CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that about half the country, 48%, thinks the economy remains in a downturn. Only 35% of Americans say that things in the country today are going well, which is actually an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall.

She adds that while just 26% of Americans say they feel the economy is starting to recover from the problems it faced in the past few years, that’s also up from 20% last summer and 17% in December 2022.

Frustration with affordability continues

The Fed’s work to control inflation was always billed as tough medicine, and there’s growing frustration with it.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic senators told policymakers in a letter Sunday that they also have a duty to acknowledge that “astronomical” mortgage rates are fueling a housing affordability crisis.

“We urge you to consider the effects of your interest rate decisions on the housing market and to reverse the troubling rate hikes that have put affordable housing out of reach for too many,” Warren and fellow Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper, Jacky Rosen and Sheldon Whitehouse wrote.

Their letter is proof that the fact of a strong economy is felt, if at all, in different ways.

Anyone hoping to buy or sell a house is not likely to say this is a great economy. Anyone in a sector, like tech, which has suffered massive layoffs, is not likely to say this is a great economy. And anyone who still feels like eggs are more expensive than they used to be may wonder how this can be a great economy."

(We partnered with Gapminder, a Swedish nonprofit, to poll 600 people ages 18 to 65 about the economy. The sample was balanced to reflect U.S. demography.)

✓ Check Yourself Test your assumptions in The Post's editorial quiz, powered by Gapminder. 1 of 4 The economies of the Euro zone are 3 percent bigger today than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. How is the U.S. economy today* compared with before the pandemic? It’s 7% smaller It’s the same size It’s 7% bigger *As of the end of Q3 2023

Brisk consumer spending has made the U.S. economic recovery from the pandemic stronger than Europe’s. Large federal government aid in 2020 and 2021 boosted U.S. household spending and saving. On top of that, many Americans locked in rock-bottom mortgage rates when they were low, so they have not felt the sting of high interest rates as much as consumers in other countries. Strong wage growth and stock market gains have also fueled U.S. spending.

Even so, top-line numbers can mask economic challenges Americans face. Hasn’t inflation stung many households?

The average price for gas was about $2.40 when President Biden took office. The price reached an all-time high of $5 a gallon in June 2022 mainly because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But gas prices have fallen a lot since then and are now just over $3 a gallon.

Yet Americans buy far more than just gas. What’s the big picture?

Inflation hit a 40-year high in the summer of 2022. Prices for almost everything were rising: food, cars, travel, appliances. Costs for many were rising faster than their pay. But that changed in 2023 as many workers saw large wage increases. The average worker’s pay has risen 20.5 percent since January 2020, outpacing the 19 percent rise in inflation over the same time frame. Many low-wage workers are doing even better.

These facts prompt a look at the state of American jobs.

4 of 4 Which president had the strongest job growth in his first term? Donald Trump Mr. Biden Barack Obama

This question is a bit unfair; presidents have only so much control over the economy, and the timing of presidential terms determines how the numbers look. (President Donald Trump saw more than 6 million jobs added in his first three years in office, but those gains disappeared in the pandemic. He ended his first term with millions of job losses.) Moreover, Mr. Biden’s first term isn’t done. But anyone who claims that this key indicator of economic health is off-track has not been paying attention to the country’s jobs bonanza, with record-low levels of unemployment and more than 14 million jobs added through December 2023.

The U.S. economy — and American workers — have been remarkably resilient. The Federal Reserve’s campaign against inflation has cooled price increases. Hiring remains robust. And growth recently accelerated. Americans are finally becoming more upbeat about the U.S. economy as gas and grocery prices stabilize and growth continues with no recession in sight. There are still people struggling, as food insecurity data and fast-growing credit card debt demonstrate. But jobs remain plentiful and unemployment has sat below 4 percent for the longest stretch in U.S. history since the Vietnam War era. Wages are now strongly outpacing inflation, especially for lower-wage workers, which is boosting spending and people’s confidence in the economy’s future.

Presidents generally get too much credit — or blame — for economic circumstances over which they have much less power than Americans imagine. Yet it is simply wrong to remember Mr. Trump’s term as an economic renaissance that contrasts with misery today. Mr. Biden deserves more credit, if only for staying out of the Fed’s way, something that Mr. Trump might not have done. All Americans should celebrate the “soft landing” the United States is enjoying.

The Washington Post,"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 16:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA0LzEzL2JpZGVuLWluZmxhdGlvbi1wb2xpdGljYWwtYW5hbHlzaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"President Biden has a story he wants to tell voters about the economy, one of consistent job growth over the course of his presidency and of a pandemic recovery that has led the world. Inflation keeps getting in the way. Last week’s inflation report showed consumer prices rising 3.5 percent from March 2023 to March 2024. This continued a string of surprises this year, suggesting a resurgence in inflation after signs had pointed in the other direction.

Biden administration officials have noted that the inflation rate has fallen since its earlier peak, but the latest numbers show it has not fully cooled. For now, it is moving in the wrong direction and remains above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent.

Despite unemployment at a half-century low, the president’s economic job approval is net negative by a significant margin. The RealClearPolitics average shows that he is net negative by 18 percentage points on his handling of the economy and by 27 percentage points on how he’s dealt with inflation.

Political strategists in both parties have reported that voters repeatedly point to higher prices as a source of their unhappiness about the state of the country. The cost of everyday items — gasoline, food, housing — hits them constantly.

It’s hard to persuade voters to look on the sunny side when they are feeling the squeeze of higher prices on their household budgets. Voters’ common refrain is summed up as: Things cost too much.

Gasoline prices are rising once again, a typical occurrence as summer approaches. Although they are below their peak during the Biden presidency, they are significantly higher than when he took office. In early 2021, average gas price was $2.42. Today it is about $3.50, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Food prices are taking another bite out of household incomes. From 2019 to 2023, food prices rose by 25 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Food costs accounted for 11.3 percent of disposable income in 2022, according to the most recent USDA analysis. That is the highest it has been since 1991, when families spent 11.4 percent of disposable income on food.

A dozen eggs now cost, on average, about $2.99, according to one indicator. That compares to an inflation-adjusted $2.09 per dozen in 2020.

Higher interest rates have meant more costly home mortgages. Mortgage rates began to ease but that has stalled or even begun to reverse. The Wall Street Journal carried a story on Friday that looked at the impact on middle-income families. The headline read: “Stay Put or Pay Up: Home Buyers Lose Hope for Lower Rates.”

The story said that, in March, a median-income family could afford a house costing no more than $416,000, given current interest rates and assuming a down payment of 20 percent. Three years ago, when mortgage rates were lower, that family could have bought a house valued at $561,000.

Other unexpected and unavoidable costs are hitting family pocketbooks. Car insurance is one example, with rates up 22.2 percent in the past year, the biggest increase since 1976. In Nevada, a presidential battleground state, auto insurance rates were up 38 percent over the previous year, according to a CNN report.

My colleague Heather Long posted on X earlier this year that, as of February, household repair costs had risen 18 percent over the previous year and nonprescription drugs were up 9 percent. Both, she noted on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, were the highest such increases ever recorded.

Biden issued a statement last week after the March consumer price index report. He stressed that inflation had declined by more than 60 percent from its peak but said, “We have more to do to lower costs for hard-working families.” He added, “Fighting inflation remains my top economic priority.”

But presidents have few weapons in the fight against inflation. Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, said 90 percent of controlling inflation is the job of the Federal Reserve. “The White House mostly has to figure out the best message to get through it, without a lot of tools to change the reality,” he said.

Biden has pushed policies aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs and he has gone after junk fees that companies add to things like airline tickets, car rentals and event tickets. He announced initiatives to provide assistance for home buyers in his State of the Union address, but they are going nowhere.

Twice this past week, the administration announced actions to reduce student debt, efforts aimed to shore up support among younger voters. But those policies affect the pocketbooks only of those who qualify while adding future costs to the government. And they have drawn criticism for helping some who went to college at the expense of others who never went to college.

The Fed would cut interest rates for two reasons — to head off a recession if one was looming or because inflation had eased enough to give officials confidence that lower rates would not reignite another inflationary round. Neither condition exists right now.

There is no recession on the horizon, after a long period of predictions that interest rate hikes could or would bring about a recession. And now prices are rising more rapidly than expected.

Economists think it’s doubtful there will be a rate cut in June, as had been assumed a few months ago. A reduction in rates in September, though perhaps warranted economically by then, could be too close to the election, leaving Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell open to criticism that the Fed was acting to help Biden politically.

The 2024 election will be fought over more than economic issues. The biggest political story of the past week was the decision by the Arizona Supreme Court to resurrect an 1864 law that bans abortions except in the case of a danger to the life of the mother and that imposes penalties on those who provide abortions.

The decision will ensure that abortion will be a key issue in one of the most important battlegrounds in November, with the likelihood of an abortion referendum on the ballot. Vice President Harris, who has led the administration’s messaging on abortion for the past two years, flew to Arizona on Friday to highlight the state court action.

Biden has also made clear he will continue to focus on former president Donald Trump as a threat to democracy. Trump has said a second term would be an opportunity for retribution against his adversaries, and he has never retreated from his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.

In the 2022 midterm elections, pre-election polls suggested that inflation and the economy were the biggest issues on the minds of voters, which led to predictions of sweeping Republican gains.

In the end, however, abortion and threats to democracy combined to motivate Democratic voters. Republicans came out of the midterms disappointed, gaining only a tiny majority in the House, failing to take control of the Senate and losing several contested elections for governor."
442,What Biden Should Say About the Economy During the State of the Union - The New Yorker,What Biden Should Say About the Economy During the State of the Union  The New Yorker,"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbmV3cy9vdXItY29sdW1uaXN0cy93aGF0LWJpZGVuLXNob3VsZC1zYXktYWJvdXQtdGhlLWVjb25vbXktZHVyaW5nLXRoZS1zdGF0ZS1vZi10aGUtdW5pb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The New Yorker,"On Thursday night, President Joe Biden will deliver his election-year State of the Union address. A spate of new opinion polls released over the weekend highlighted the serious challenges facing him as he seeks reëlection: concerns about his age, the southern border, the Israel-Hamas war, and the economy. The RealClearPolitics poll average currently shows him trailing Donald Trump by two points in a head-to-head contest, and by 2.8 points when third-party candidates are included. It’s particularly alarming for the President that, with many voters still focussed on the rising cost of living, he hasn’t received much credit for an economic record that, in many ways, is impressive. According to the poll average, just 40.2 per cent of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, and 57.4 per cent disapprove. To improve his electoral prospects, Biden badly needs to turn those figures around. The State of the Union presents a much needed opportunity for him to talk to the American people about his economic record. Here, with apologies for my lame efforts to capture his folksy syntax, is a suggestion for how he might go about it:

Good evening, my fellow-Americans. Since I last spoke to you from this hallowed chamber of democracy, thirteen months ago, the U.S. economy has continued its strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. This time last year, many economists were predicting a recession following the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates in order to bring down inflation. But, far from slumping, the economy expanded at a faster rate in 2023 than it did in the previous year: 2.5 per cent, compared with 1.9 per cent. In the first three years of my Presidency, inflation-adjusted G.D.P. growth has averaged 3.4 per cent. I don’t want to belabor the point, but that compares with an average annual growth of less than one per cent under the other guy.

And here is another comparison, one you may have heard me make before: in economic terms, the United States is outpacing the rest of the developed world. Don’t take my word for it. Ask the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is a bunch of economic wonks from various countries who get to work in a nice, leafy part of Paris. According to the O.E.C.D.’s latest global economic report, which was released a few weeks ago, the U.S. economy easily outgrew the rest of the G7 bloc in 2023, with only Japan getting anywhere close. For 2024, the O.E.C.D. is predicting a repeat performance, with the U.S. expanding three and a half times as fast as the Euro area and twice as fast as Japan. If there were an Olympic gold medal for rebounding from the pandemic, Team U.S.A. would be receiving it.

Getting back to the home front, during the past twelve months job growth has also remained reassuringly robust. Between January, 2023, and January, 2024, employers increased their payrolls by more than 2.9 million. Thanks to a strong demand for workers, the unemployment rate stands at just 3.7 per cent. In fact, it’s been below four per cent for roughly two years now, which is something that hasn’t happened since the Beatles were still together and I was graduating from law school and going to work as a public defender in Wilmington.

Jobs, jobs, jobs. Over the years, you’ve probably heard me say how my father used to always tell me that a job is about more than a paycheck—it’s about your dignity, your respect. Well, thanks to the strength of the labor market, more and more Americans from historically disadvantaged groups have been able to find some of that dignity and respect—and a regular paycheck. Since September, 2022, the unemployment rate for Black Americans has been at or below six per cent. It hasn’t been this low for such an extended period since the Labor Department started keeping records, more than fifty years ago. The unemployment rate among Hispanics is only five per cent. Among Americans with disabilities, it’s 6.6 per cent, down from twelve per cent when I took office, in January, 2021.

Now, I’m not claiming that I, or any of my Democratic colleagues, deserve all the credit for these developments. A lot of the kudos should go to the enterprising Americans who created nearly 5.5 million new businesses last year—that’s another record—and to the countless hardworking Americans who have joined, or rejoined, the workforce since the pandemic relented. I’ve always said: nobody can match the American worker for enterprise and hard work. Nobody.

But healthy economic growth involves a partnership between the private sector and the public sector. And my Administration, together with Congress, has taken a number of unprecedented steps to boost the economy and make it stronger for the longer term, including passing the American Rescue Plan Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law, and the CHIPS Act. How have these pieces of legislation worked out? Well, one way to gauge the results is to look at the manufacturing sector. Last year, American manufacturers raised their spending on new plants and other facilities by more than sixty per cent. According to the Commerce Department statisticians, that was the biggest increase since Harry Truman was giving ’em hell from the Oval Office.

Of course, we need to balance these positive developments with the fact that too many Americans are still struggling to pay their bills, put food on their tables, and get ahead in life. We all know that over the past few years the cost of many essential household items—from food to car insurance and rent—has gone up and stayed up. High inflation has been a worldwide phenomenon, but that’s no consolation to American families who are having to change their buying habits, cancel their vacations, or postpone their plans of finding a new home.

Thankfully, over the past year and a half, the inflation rate has come down sharply: it’s now running at 3.1 per cent. The prices of some items that skyrocketed during 2021-22, including eggs, fuel oil, gasoline, and used cars, have fallen back somewhat, although they are still too high. Plus, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, hundreds of thousands of seniors are now paying a lot less for insulin than they used to. Under the old system, the average out-of-pocket cost for people on Medicare was about sixty-three dollars a month; today, it is capped at thirty-five dollars. For seniors on fixed incomes, that’s an important piece of cost relief, and the savings aren’t confined to Medicare. In last year’s State of the Union, I called for an extension of the thirty-five-dollars-a-month cap to all Americans, regardless of their age or insurance status. I’m glad to report that, at the start of this year, a number of major drug companies did adopt this policy, cutting their prices, in some cases, by more than seventy per cent. That’s good news!

But we’ve still got a lot of work to do. Prices remain too high for a lot of everyday goods. And I want to assure the American public that, if I am reëlected, my Administration will continue to do all it can to help relieve the cost burdens on hardworking Americans. In some cases, we’ll rely on existing legislation. For example, starting in 2025, all Medicare recipients will see their total prescription-drug costs capped at two thousand dollars per year. We’ll use other tactics, too, such as pressing corporations that have been padding their profits to pass along savings to their customers and using antitrust laws to boost competition. Just last week, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block a merger between two big supermarket chains on the grounds that it would lead to higher prices for consumers. That’s unacceptable. Also, we’ll look for new ways to tackle some of the big long-term challenges that the country needs to address, such as making college more affordable for low- and middle-income students; reducing the racial wealth gap; and helping first-time buyers to purchase a home.

So there’s a lot to be done, and I understand why so many people tell opinion pollsters that the economic recovery hasn’t filtered down to them. But, to conclude, I’d like to mention a bit of good news on that front. In December, a Wall Street Journal poll found that just thirty-four per cent of Americans believed their personal financial situation had moved in the right direction in the previous year. In a new Journal poll that was released on Sunday, this figure had moved up to forty-three per cent, a jump of nine points in two months. Of course, I’d like to see the number rise to well above fifty per cent, but the trend is moving in the right direction. My fellow-Americans, all the hard work of the past few years is starting to pay off. Let’s finish the job. ♦"

President Biden’s reelection campaign faces a heady array of challenges, including the age question (he’s 81) and the likely Republican nominee, former president Donald Trump. What will he have to do to avoid becoming the 2nd consecutive incumbent president (and 12th in history) to lose a bid for a second term?

Tops among the issues he has to tackle: immigration, Gaza, and the economy, all of which have shown up in the results of several early primaries.

With immigration and the war in Gaza, Biden appears to be caught in damned-if-he-does, damned-if-he-doesn’t scenarios, taking hits from both Republicans and many on the more liberal side of his own party. The robust economy is less of an issue for what may be wrong with it—not much, in most experts’ views—than for the fact that many Americans think it’s bad and refuse to give his administration any credit for its actual strength.

An incumbent (or previous) president has failed to win reelection 11 times in history, the last in 2020 when Trump lost to Biden. We asked some Boston University faculty experts in American politics and the presidency, foreign policy, and government affairs to assess how Biden can deal with these three key issues to avoid becoming the 12th.

Immigration

Trump and his minions are making plenty of hay out of what is, from any perspective, a big mess at our southern border, with thousands of migrants arriving every week from Central America and elsewhere.

Although Republican rhetoric is laced with racism and lies about the criminal character of the migrants, the sheer numbers of arrivals spreading out across the United States makes this a legit issue, and Biden seems to be hardening his approach. Many on the left, on the other hand, think asylum seekers deserve a more sympathetic response.

Thomas Whalen, a College of General Studies associate professor of social sciences, who specializes in 19th- and 20th-century American social and political history, says Biden isn’t the one to blame.

“I think here we see where the paralysis in Congress is having its greatest impact, because presidents can’t do everything under our constitutional order,” says Whalen, who has written several books on sports and society. “We don’t elect kings every four years. Biden is constrained by the rule of law, and Congress has shown a decided inability [or unwillingness] to act on this issue, at least on the Republican side. This is, from their point of view, a winning issue.”

Whalen notes that Republicans in both houses of Congress abandoned a bipartisan deal that was brokered earlier, because politically it would be damaging to their base, or at least cost the support of the base.

“To me this is the problem with American government right now,” Whalen says. “We are living in an ungovernable country, and it’s at a crisis point. He needs congressional action and he’s not gonna get it.”

The president might take extraordinary measures through executive order to close the border, he says, “but then he will be seen as desperate—it will be seen as a pure political move, and he’ll lose a good part of his liberal democratic base. So it’s a lose-lose on Biden’s part.”

The one thing he can do on the issue, Whalen says, is to follow President Harry Truman’s playbook from 1948 and run against a “do-nothing Congress.”

Gaza

“‘American voters don’t care about foreign policy.’ That old line often gets thrown around at election time,” says Andrew David, a CGS lecturer in social science whose research interests include the US presidency and the history of US foreign policy. “Yet, the ‘uncommitted’ campaign in Michigan’s Democratic primary, which garnered 100,000 votes last month, was primarily driven by Biden’s Gaza policy.”

Gaza, David says, is “the classic foreign policy trap for an American president”: the expectation that American power can and should be used to solve a crisis, with pressure from opposing domestic groups to be more forceful in words and deeds. Some want Biden to support Israel unwaveringly after the October 7 Hamas terrorist offensive. Others, including more liberal Democrats, Arab Americans, and some Jews, want him to use every tool at his disposal to stop what they see as a genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

A successful Biden-led cease-fire could ameliorate some of these concerns, but America lacks the clout in the region it had, going back to the 1970s, David says, and Biden’s efforts could address that, too.

“Better late than never, but Biden’s recent toughening stance against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu still can go a lot further, given the growing civilian body count in Gaza,” says Whalen.

“The president continues to tiptoe around the issue. Given all the military aid and public support he receives from the US, Netanyahu has no problem thumbing his nose at the Biden Administration. That kind of rank ingratitude needs to stop,” Whalen says. “I understand Biden does not want to alienate Jewish American voters, but in doing so, he’s alienating Arab-American voters, and also a huge swath of young Americans under 30.

“Alienating this new Generation Z, I think in some ways is an even greater threat, not just to Biden in 2024, but for the Democratic Party moving forward,” he says.

The Economy

Recent scholarship has stressed the relative limits on the ability of presidents to influence the economy, David says, “yet voters naturally link the status of the economy to presidential performance. That Biden doesn’t have more support because of this is surprising.”

The economy, by most metrics, is good. Unemployment remains low, a recession seems to have been avoided, and wage gains continue. Hesitation among voters on economic matters is understandable considering high inflation and interest rates. But the overall picture is good, and “it remains Biden’s job to prove the economy is strong,” David says.

Biden was quite impressive during his State of the Union address March 7, touching on key issues where “there’s a host of misinformation floating around about how much more improved the economy is under his presidency,” says Christine Slaughter, a College of Arts & Sciences associate professor of political science.

“In many ways, he set the record straight about the state of the economy, and the positive trends—such as the Black unemployment rate, which is at an all-time low, yet still nearly double the unemployment rate for whites—that are benefiting voters, specifically Black Americans and Latino Americans,” Slaughter says.

“Democrats have to continue to message those gains to voters, and they must use trusted messengers to deliver those messages to non-white voters, who have a slight decline in enthusiasm for supporting the Democratic ticket,” she says. “These messages should look different for young and older voters who are more or less entrenched in Democratic party politics.”

“It’s a bread-and-butter issue,” says Whalen. “People see it at the grocery store, the prices, and they see the prices of other domestic goods, like cars and so forth. And it kind of just eats away at their bottom line.

“But what people and what analysts don’t get right now is that wages are also rising,” he says. “The sting of inflation is slowly being rubbed away for many people in the middle class. So that might go in a positive direction for Biden. But the perception is now that, you know, the economy is still not recovered, not recovered sufficiently.”

Biden “is a horrible messenger, though. He has to get the message out there, but that’s where his age comes in, because he just doesn’t seem to have the energy to kind of do the whistle-stop tour that Truman did in 1948.”

Summing up:

After his victory in 2016, Trump received credit for running as a populist candidate—an advocate for the “little person,” David says. Statistics don’t suggest that was the reason he won, but both parties have positioned themselves as the champion of the average American.

“Biden seems to be taking a real stab at connecting rhetoric with reality,” he says. “The monthly distribution of child tax credit checks early in his administration and his effort to eliminate student debt both encountered some success. He recently became the first president to march with striking union workers. His efforts might help us more definitively say whether voters are as keen on rewarding action as they are to support rhetoric.”

But Slaughter says that to reach Black voters, whose support was key for Biden in 2020, it’s important to emphasize the absolute difference between the two (presumptive) major party candidates.

Ronald Reagan was underestimated too. Going into 1984, he was considered old and doddering too, and guess what happened there?

“Republicans have worked to demobilize the Black vote by blocking voting rights legislation. There have been many attempts to erode the protections of the Voting Rights Act, such as gerrymandering Black voters into districts, photo identification requirements, and denying organizations the right to challenge voter suppression legally,” Slaughter says.

But while there’s a clear difference between the two parties, “Democrats have yet to fulfill many promises made in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020,” she says. “There hasn’t been a successful police reform bill or federal oversight of law enforcement officers, and it seems like Democrats have all but retreated from the issue.”

“I think you have to take a lesson from 1984,” Whalen says. “Relatively late in the election cycle, Ronald Reagan was not doing so good. We were coming out of one of the worst recessions in modern memory, and it took a while for the public [to realize], but, you know, come election day, they voted for Reagan.

“It was a complete turnaround,” he says. “The economy makes the biggest difference of all. Inflation is still hanging around, prices are still unusually high, but if they get down a little bit more, like the price of gas, which has been going down overall the last few months, I think Biden will be in pretty good political shape, barring some other catastrophe.

“He’s probably following the Reagan political game plan here, which is basically, ‘the economy is doing well, and we’re gonna run on a prosperity platform.’ Biden was never really overwhelmingly popular in any race. He lost a couple of presidential bids, but in terms of Senate races, he always had long odds against him and he always pulled it off.

However, over the past 30 years, college tuition prices have increased faster than median incomes, leaving many Americans with large amounts of student debt that they struggle or are unable to, pay off.

Recognizing the burden of this debt, the Biden-Harris Administration has pursued two key strategies for debt reduction and cancellation. The first, student debt relief (SDR), aims to address the ill effects of flaws in the student debt system for borrowers. The second, the SAVE plan, reforms the federal student loan system, improving student loan affordability for future students and providing current graduates with breathing room during the beginning of a new career.

This issue brief examines the factors that precipitated the current student debt landscape, and details how both SDR and SAVE will enhance the economic status of millions of Americans with student debt: enabling them to allocate more funds towards basic necessities, take career risks, start businesses, and purchase homes. This brief highlights credible research, underscoring how the Administration’s student debt relief could boost consumption in the short-term by billions of dollars and could have important impacts on borrower mental health, financial security, and outcomes such as homeownership and entrepreneurship. This brief also details how the SAVE plan makes repaying college costs more affordable for current borrowers and future generations. CEA simulations show that, under SAVE, an average borrower with a bachelor’s degree could save $20,000 in loan payments, while a borrower with an associate degree could see nearly 90 percent savings compared to the standard loan repayment plan. These changes enable more people to pursue education and contribute to the broader economy.

Why do borrowers need relief?

Over the last 20 years especially, the sticker price of college has risen significantly. Despite recent minor declines, sticker prices at public universities (which over 70% of undergraduate students in the United States attend) are 56% higher today than two decades ago.[1] While there are many reasons for this trend, the most rapid increases in tuition often occur during economic downturns as tuitions grow to fill the budgetary holes that are left when states cut their support to public colleges (Webber, 2017; Deming and Walters 2018). This is especially problematic given many people choose to return to school during economic downturns (Betts and MacFarland 1995; Hillman and Orians 2013). Unfortunately, contracting state appropriations have played a role in shifting the responsibility of financing away from public subsidies and toward students and families (Turner and Barr, 2013; Bound et al., 2019)–leading many students to take on more debt.

At the same time that college sticker prices have risen, the wage premium (the earnings difference between college goers and high school graduates) has not seen analogous growth. While obtaining a college degree remains a reliable entry point to the middle class, the relative earning gains for degree holders began to stagnate in the early 2000s after increasing for several decades. As shown in Figure 1b, since 2000, the wage premium for both bachelor’s degree holders and those with “some college” education (which includes anyone who enrolled in college but didn’t earn a BA) saw declines around the 2001-02 and 2008-10 recessions and a slow, inconsistent recovery thereafter. The decline is particularly notable for students who didn’t complete a four-year degree, a group that includes two-year college enrollees who have among the highest student loan default rates.[2]

Traditional economic theory tells us that individuals choose to invest in post-secondary education based on the expected costs and wage returns associated with the investment. But rapid and unforeseeable rises in prices and declines in college wage premia have contributed to decades of “unlucky” college-entry cohorts affected by a form of recessionary scarring. For example, a student who entered college in 2006 would have expected a sticker price of roughly $8,800 per year for a four-year college, but actually faced tuition of over $10,000 in their final year of college, a roughly 15% difference. This same student, upon graduation if they worked full time, would have earned about $3,500 less, on average, than what they would have expected upon entering. This example illustrates that many borrowers made sound borrowing decisions with available information, but as a result of these trends ended up with more debt than they could afford to pay off.[3] Consistent with this notion, the default rate for “unlucky” college entry cohorts of the 2000s is much higher than those of other cohorts, with undergraduate default rates doubling between 2000 and 2010: in 2017, 21 percent of undergraduate loan holders and 6 percent of graduate loan holders defaulted within 3 years (CBO, 2020).

It is important to note that sticker prices for public institutions have declined 7 percent since 2021, the same period over which college wage premiums have been rising. Declining tuition, for the first time in decades, coincided with increased investment in higher education through pandemic-era legislation such as the American Rescue Plan, which allocated $40 billion in 2021 to support institutes of higher education and their students. Despite these improvements, as well as significant advances in the return on college investments over the last three years, many current borrowers still need some relief. The Administration has taken significant action to protect future cohorts from similar risks.

How the Administration is providing relief

Retrospective: Student Debt Relief Helps Existing Borrowers

In a commitment to help those who are overburdened with debt, the Administration has already approved Federal student debt cancellation for nearly 4 million Americans through various actions. Today, the Administration announced details of proposed rules that, if finalized as proposed, would provide relief to over 30 million borrowers when taken together with actions to date.

Importantly, much of this debt forgiveness comes from correcting program administration and improving regulations related to laws that were on the books before this Administration took office. This debt relief has affected borrowers from all walks of life, including nearly 900,000 Americans who have dedicated their lives to public service (such as teachers, social workers, nurses, firefighters, police officers, and others), borrowers who were misled and cheated by their institutions, and borrowers who are facing total or permanent disability, including many veterans. By relieving these borrowers of long-held, and in some cases very large burdens of debt, relief can have significant meaning and impact for borrowers, families, and their communities.

By reducing debtors’ liabilities, debt relief raises net worth (assets, including income less liabilities). Debt relief can also ease the financial burden of making payments—leading to greater disposable income for borrowers and their families, which enhances living standards and could positively influence decisions about employment, home buying, and mobility. While there are few direct estimates of the effect of debt cancelation in the literature, estimates based on the relationship between wealth and consumption suggest that this forgiveness could increase consumption by several billions of dollars each year in the next five to ten years.

Additionally, a recent study suggests that student debt cancellation can lead to increased earnings (due to greater geographic and career mobility), improved credit scores, and lower delinquency rates on other debts (Di Maggio, Kalda, and Yao, 2019). This can facilitate access to capital for starting a business or buying a car or home. As home mortgages often require a certain debt-to-income ratio and depend heavily on credit scores, student debt cancellation could potentially increase home ownership. Indeed, based on the mechanical relationship between housing industry affordability standards and debt-to-income ratios, industry sources have suggested that those without student debt could afford to take out substantially larger mortgages (Zillow, 2018). Other research also indicates a negative correlation between student loan debt and homeownership (Mezza et al., 2020).



It is important to note that, while these pecuniary benefits are important, the benefits associated with debt relief are not merely financial. Experimental evidence has linked holding debt to heightened levels of stress and anxiety (Drentea and Reynolds, 2012), worse self-reported physical health (Sweet et al., 2013), and reduced cognitive capacity (Robb et al., 2012; Ong et al., 2019). Studies also show that holding student debt can be a barrier to positive life cycle outcomes such as entrepreneurship (Krishnan and Wang, 2019), and marriage (Gicheva, 2016; Sieg and Wang, 2018). Student debt relief has the potential to improve these key outcomes for millions of borrowers.

Prospective: The SAVE Plan Helps Prevent Future Challenges

To address unaffordable education financing moving forward, the Administration has also introduced the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) loan repayment program. The SAVE plan prospectively helps student borrowers by ensuring that once they graduate, they never have to pay more than they can afford towards their student loan debt. Importantly, the SAVE plan protects borrowers from being “unlucky” by ensuring that high tuition or low earnings do not result in loan payments that borrowers can’t afford. The CEA has detailed the real benefits of SAVE for borrowers in issue briefs and blogs, underscoring that SAVE is the most affordable student loan repayment program in U.S. history. By substantially reducing monthly payment amounts compared to previous income driven repayment (IDR) plans and reducing time to forgiveness to as little as 10 years for people who borrowed smaller amounts, the SAVE plan can mean tens of thousands of dollars in real savings for borrowers over the course of repayment.

Figure 2 gives the example of two representative borrowers. Take the first, a 4-year college graduate who has $31,000 in debt and earns about $40,500 per year. Under a standard repayment plan, this borrower would pay roughly $330 dollars each month for 10 years. Under SAVE, this borrower would pay about $50 per month for the first ten years, and on average about $130 per month for the next 10 years. Over a 20-year period, this borrower would make roughly $17,500 less in payments, not accounting for inflation over that period. This represents a 56 percent reduction in total payments compared to the standard repayment plan and includes considerable loan forgiveness. Similarly, the representative 2-year college graduate has $10,000 in debt and earns about $32,000 per year. Under a standard plan, this borrower would pay $110 dollars each month for 10 years. Under SAVE, this borrower would pay $0 per month for the first two years, and under $20 per month for the next eight years before their debt is forgiven at year 10. Overall, this borrower would be responsible for roughly $11,700 less in lifetime payments, not accounting for inflation. This borrower sees nearly 90 percent savings compared to the standard plan and receives considerable loan forgiveness.

SAVE can also have benefits beyond the individual borrower. More money in borrowers’ pockets due to lower payment obligations under SAVE could boost consumption and give borrowers breathing room to make payments on other debt. This consumption effect is bolstered by a large literature documenting the benefits of easing liquidity constraints (see, for example, Aydin, 2022; Parker et al., 2022). Additionally, by shortening time to forgiveness for undergraduate borrowers, SAVE can lead to positive debt-relief outcomes (as discussed above) for many more borrowers.

Another key aspect of income-driven repayment plans like SAVE is that they protect borrowers from having to make large payments when incomes are low. Specifically, the required payments are not based on the initial loan balance, but on one’s income and household size so that those cohorts who need to borrow more to pay for college do not make larger payments unless they make more income. SAVE also protects more of a borrower’s income as discretionary and, when the full plan is implemented in Summer 2024, will limit monthly payments on undergraduate loans to 5 percent of discretionary income. In fact, for single borrowers who make less than $33,000 per year, the required monthly payments will be zero dollars. From a finance perspective, the SAVE plan provides a form of insurance against tuition spikes and economic downturns–taking some of the risk out of investing in one’s education while also bringing costs down.

A common concern, and one that could mute these benefits, is that increases in the generosity of education financing may encourage institutions to raise tuition and fees in response, a phenomenon commonly referred to as the Bennett Hypothesis (for an excellent overview of research, see Dynarski et al., 2022). Theoretically, in a market when sellers are maximizing profits, any policy that increases demand will also increase prices. However, this is less likely to impact the over 70% of U.S. undergraduates who attend public colleges, which are not profit-driven and often have statutorily set tuition. Consistent with this notion, the evidence in support of the Bennett Hypothesis primarily comes from for-profit colleges, which are highly reliant on students who receive federal financial aid (Cellini and Goldin, 2014; Baird et al, 2022).[4] Importantly, although the for-profit sector enrolls some of the country’s most vulnerable students, enrollment in the sector in 2021 accounted for only 5 percent of total undergraduate enrollment, suggesting that aggregate tuition increases in response to changes in education financing may be modest. Furthermore, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to crack down on for-profit colleges that take advantage of, or mislead, their students. And, recent regulations, such as the Gainful Employment (GE) rule, add safeguards against unaffordable debt regardless of more generous education financing.

Although the SAVE plan stands to benefit borrowers of all backgrounds, the plan has important racial and socioeconomic equity implications because it is particularly beneficial for those borrowers with the lowest incomes. Centuries of inequities have led to Black, Hispanic, and Native households being more likely than their White peers to fall in the low end of the income distribution. This means that, mechanically, the SAVE plan’s benefits could accrue disproportionately to these groups. Indeed, using completion data from recent years, an Urban Institute analysis estimates that 59 percent of credentials earned by Black students and 53 percent of credentials earned by Hispanic students are likely to be eligible for some amount of loan forgiveness under SAVE, compared to 42 percent of credentials earned by White students (Delisle and Cohn, 2023). Finally, the interest subsidy described in an August 2023 CEA blog, prevents ballooning balances when a borrower cannot cover their entire monthly interest payment, a phenomenon that has historically led to many borrowers in general, and Black borrowers in particular, to see loan balances that are higher than their original loan amount, even several years out from graduating with a bachelor’s degree (NCES, 2023).

Broader economic impacts

The benefits associated with SDR and SAVE for millions of Americans are considerable. In the short run, under both SDR and SAVE, those who receive relief may be able to spend more in their communities and contribute to their local economies. Summing the likely consumption effects of the Administration’s student debt relief and SAVE programs results in billions of dollars in additional consumption annually. Despite the modest effect on the macroeconomy as a whole (note that the U.S. economy is roughly $28 trillion with a population of roughly 320 million), these consumption effects represent incredibly meaningful impacts on individual borrowers’ financial security and the economic wellbeing of their communities.

SAVE, because it brings down the cost of taking out loans to go to college, has the potential to lead to longer-term economic growth if it leads to greater educational attainment. This increased attainment can occur both through improved retention and completion of post-secondary education, and also the movement of students into college who would not have otherwise enrolled. There is a long macroeconomics literature linking educational attainment in a nation to GDP growth (see, for example, Lucas, 1988; Hanushek and Woesmann, 2008). While identifying the causal effect of schooling on GDP is challenging, researchers, using a variety of approaches, find that a one-year increase in average education (for the entire working population) would increase the real GDP level by between 5 and 12 percent (Barro and Lee, 2013; Soto, 2002) —a result that is in line with the micro-founded relationship between years of education and earnings (Lovenheim and Smith, 2022).

To put this relationship in perspective and highlight the growth potential of increasing educational attainment, the CEA simulated the hypothetical effect on GDP of increasing the college-going rate by 1, 3, and 5 percentage points, respectively. This range represents the kinds of changes in college going that have been observed over several years: the college enrollment rate for 18- to 24-year-olds declined 4 percentage points between 2011 and 2021 after increasing by 6 percentage points between 2000 and 2011 (NCES 2023). CEA simulations show that by 2055, a policy that increased the college going rate by 1, 3, and 5 percentage points could increase the level of GDP in 2055 (thirty years from now) by 0.2, 0.6, and 1 percent respectively. This represents hundreds of billions of dollars of additional economic activity in the long run.

While increased growth is an exciting possibility, it would only occur insofar as SAVE leads to increased educational attainment, which is uncertain. The academic literature has found that student loans can promote academic performance (Barr, et. al. 2021), and increase educational attainment by increasing transfers from 2-year to 4-year colleges and increasing college completion among enrollees (Marx and Turner, 2019). At the same time, increases in college-going due to SAVE are by no means guaranteed. While, historically, policies that reduce the cost of college through direct means—such as providing students with generous grant aid, or reducing tuition—have succeeded at raising college enrollment levels (Dynarski, 2003; Turner, 2011), a pair of recent studies show that prospective students may only respond to cost changes when they are salient, i.e., they are framed and marketed in the right way (Dynarski et al., 2021), and relatively certain (Burland et al., 2022). However, evidence suggests that there is demand for plans like SAVE (Balakrishnan et al., 2024), particularly as SAVE can provide sizable benefits to borrowers in terms of reducing their long-term debt burden and keep monthly payments low (dependent on a borrower’s income) after they finish school.

This highlights the importance of communicating the benefits of the SAVE program to prospective students who otherwise would not enroll in college due to cost concerns, including potential barriers to paying off student loans in the future. Doing so could lead to meaningful increases in college enrollment, and the resulting improvements in productive capacity could increase the size of the U.S. economy for years to come.

Concluding remarks

The Biden-Harris Administration has taken bold action to address a student debt problem that has been decades in the making. This student debt cancellation will provide well-deserved relief for borrowers who have paid their fair share, many of whom had the proverbial rug pulled out from under them with concurrent rapidly rising tuition and declining returns to a college degree. The relief has and will improve economic health and wellbeing of those who have devoted years of their life to public service, those who were defrauded or misled by their institutions, and those who have been doing all they can to make payments, but have still seen their loan balances grow. Looking to future generations, the Administration implemented the SAVE plan to protect borrowers against tuition spikes and poorer than expected labor market outcomes that often plague students graduating into a period of economic downturn (Rothstein, 2021; Schwandt and von Wachter, 2023).

Both student debt relief and SAVE will enhance the economic status of millions of Americans with student debt: enable them to allocate more funds towards basic necessities, take career risks, start businesses, and purchase homes with the understanding that they will never have to pay more than they can afford towards their student loans. Moreover, the SAVE plan makes repayment more affordable for future generations, which helps borrowers manage monthly payments, but also enables more people from all walks of life to explore their full potential and pursue higher education, enhancing the potential of the U.S. workforce and the economy more broadly.

Those were the days on which the government released new jobs data and, in doing so, offered a sort-of-real-time assessment of how President Obama was doing in steering the country out of the recession that began several years prior.

In October 2012, those numbers showed continued improvement, to the White House’s relief: The economy had added 114,000 jobs in September. But Jack Welch, one of the biggest names in the business world and an endorser of Obama’s 2012 opponent, wasn’t buying it.

“Unbelievable jobs numbers..,” he wrote on then-Twitter. “[T]hese Chicago guys will do anything..can’t debate so change numbers.”

The implication was that the numbers were fake, that the economy was faring worse than those numbers would suggest, and so the administration must have been goosing them. This was obviously not true, but that the allegation was made at all was telling: Welch felt either like the numbers were wrong or that it was politically useful to pretend they were, or both.

Little did we know then that this was a preview of things to come.

This Friday was the first in February, so the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its estimates for job changes in January. The numbers were very good, beating expectations handily.

In fact, since Joe Biden took office, the country has added jobs every month. His first year was obviously boosted by the faster-than-normal addition of jobs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. That said, there have been seven months since the start of 2022 in which the country added more jobs than were added in the best month of Donald Trump’s first three years in office. In 2023 alone, the country added almost half the total number of jobs that were added from 2017 to 2019.

Looking at annual change, you can see the increase in employment under Biden. That big dip in employment 2020 was reversed by May 2022.

The White House points to this number frequently, often contrasting growth under Biden’s administration with the net loss under Trump’s — which includes the losses of the pandemic. It is one of several data points to which the White House cites to show that, despite rumblings to the contrary, the economy is doing well. The stock market is up, they’ll say, correctly, as are wages. More people are working in manufacturing now than at any point since the recession 15 years ago — though the number of people in the labor force is also much larger.

But Biden’s critics and Americans more broadly point to another countervailing set of data: prices. Yes, the spike in the rate of inflation is over, but prices are higher than they were several years ago.

For months, the increase in prices outpaced increases in wages, though that pattern has reversed over the past year.

Polling released by CNN on Friday shows that about half of Americans think the economy is improving or at least stable, while half think that it is continuing to get worse. That’s not great for Biden on the surface, but CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that this is an improvement over recent months.

Share this article Share

Earlier this week, Gallup released data showing a similar, modest turnaround. People are still feeling the effects of inflation, but views are turning more positive.

In other words, the negative sentiment that’s driven consideration of the economy particularly since 2022 — when gas prices spiked — appears to be softening.

But that sentiment isn’t only driven by objective metrics any more than Jack Welch’s skepticism was in 2012. A lot of it is also politics.

Consider the results when CNN broke out its question about the economy by party. Half of Democrats think the economy is improving. Half of independents think it is improving or stable. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans think it’s getting worse.

Part of this is motivated reasoning. When projected GDP growth was negative for the second quarter in a row in 2022, there was a strong push on the right to declare that the country was in recession. It wasn’t, as subsequent data has shown. With the midterms looming, this was a good indicator of how economic data would be treated.

There’s been a dramatic polarization of economic data in recent years, particularly on the right. Gallup data show that Republican sentiment on the economy plunged at the start of the recession that began in 2007. It remained low during the Obama administration — and then skyrocketed under Trump. There was no real reason for that massive jump, as the numbers shown at the start of this article suggest, but, then, sentiment is necessarily subjective.

What’s notable, though, is that Republican sentiment plunged once Biden took office — to levels below where they’d been during the recession.

That’s visible, too, in the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers. The same pattern: a huge spike under Trump and a huge plunge under Biden that outpaces the post-recession era.

This is almost certainly a function in part of Trump’s self-promotion. He was relentless about hyping the economy, cherry-picking data to suggest that it was better than it had ever been. It was a habit that leveraged existing thermostatic shifts in opinion — that is, that public opinion often changes when political leadership does — with the effect of amplifying them. Even now he is trying to take credit for the surge in the stock market, a claim that even the endlessly loyal Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business finds hard to accept.

This, Biden can’t fix. Particularly running against Trump, he’s not going to be able to convince most Republicans that the economy is getting better. He can probably continue to peel some away, assuming the existing trends in the economy continue, but not much more than that.

There is an interesting detail to pick out of this for those looking forward to November. That year was a bad one, relatively speaking, with costs increasing, gas prices soaring and the sense of optimism about the pandemic hobbled. Even among Democrats, sentiment about the economy was dour. And then Republicans underperformed in the midterms."

CNN —

Voters and economists seem to have wildly different views of the US economy, a disconnect that’s hurting President Joe Biden in the key states that will decide the 2024 election.

There’s new polling from The Wall Street Journal that outlines the dichotomy and the challenge it represents for Biden in particular as memories of the Donald Trump years fade.

Perceptions vs. data

Swing state voters, according to the Journal, are more focused on the economy and inflation than those nationwide, and they also have a dimmer view of the state of the country.

Just one-quarter of registered voters in these seven key states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – say the economy has improved in the past two years. The economic data, on the other hand, suggests inflation is cooling and the US seems likely to avoid a recession that seemed likely a year ago. The soft landing happened without even spiking the unemployment rate, which was a real fear.

“A relatively strong economy” is how Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, described it last month. For context, Summers was early to raise the alarm about the threat of inflation after the Covid-19 pandemic, and he has loudly criticized the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve for most of Biden’s term.

The US economy vs. your state economy

The disconnect runs much deeper than a misalignment of voters’ perceptions and economic indicators. About half of these voters think their own economic situation is fine, and they might rate their individual states as positive. The national economy, however, gets a bad rating.

From the Journal:

In North Carolina, for example, voters describe the national economy in negative rather than positive terms by 66% to 33%. Yet those numbers are reversed when asked to rate the state’s economy. In Wisconsin, negative views of the national economy outweigh positive ones by 16 points, while positive views of the state economy outweigh negative ones by 17 points.

Across these battleground states, 46% of registered voters said their personal financial situation is headed in the right direction.

Why the disconnect?

The divide between Americans’ views of their personal finances and their broader economic sentiments isn’t new. CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy pointed me to Gallup polling from last April in which just 16% rated the economy as good or excellent, but 45% said their personal finances were good or excellent. (Perceptions of the economy have improved modestly in the intervening year.)

Edwards-Levy also noted that partisanship can play a role in even seemingly non-political questions about the state of the nation.

“People’s answers to surveys are often intended at least partially as an expression of partisan support or opposition,” she said, adding that is “compounded when talking about broad national trends.”

Many may feel left behind

It’s also true that while people might say in a survey that their financial situation is fine, there are indications that they also feel unable to keep up.

Just read CNN’s reporting about tenants who can’t afford to pay their rents, the barriers to home ownership that are compounded on racial minorities or the issue with 401(k) balances.

Stock markets may have repeatedly set records this year, making people with investments feel flush, but only about a quarter of registered voters across the swing states surveyed by the Journal said the ability for the average person to get ahead is moving in the right direction in the US.

The ‘once people start to focus’ argument

Biden’s task with this election cycle will be to convince these voters that their personal and state situation is writ large in the country too.

As it stands, roughly half or more of registered voters in all of the swing states in the new Wall Street Journal poll say Trump is the candidate best able to handle the key issues of the economy, inflation and immigration.

Biden’s supporters say the public will come around as the election nears.

“You know what, once people start to focus in, and they see their two choices, it’s obvious that Joe will win this election,” first lady Jill Biden said on CBS on Wednesday morning.

She disputed the Journal poll, which shows Trump holding a small lead in Arizona and North Carolina and matchups within the margin of error in the other five states. When potential independent or third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are added to the question, Trump still leads by a narrow margin in Arizona and North Carolina, with no clear leader in the other states.

“He’s coming up,” Jill Biden said of the president, indicating he would rise in polls.

It’s certainly true that there’s a lot of campaigning left to do and a lot of time for developments between now and November.

Will a campaign sell voters on Biden’s economy?

On Wednesday, the president joined the progressive, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at the White House to brag about Democrats’ efforts to contain prescription drug prices.

Biden said that by allowing Medicare to negotiate for certain prescription drugs, he and Sanders “beat Big Pharma finally.” Insulin is now capped at $35 for Medicare enrollees, for instance.

Most voters probably haven’t yet gotten the message about beating Big Pharma. More than half of US adults nationwide said they worry about being able to afford prescription drugs, according to a KFF poll released in February.

Presidential favorability ages well

George W. Bush’s favorability rating was an objectively abysmal 35% when he left office in January 2009, according to CNN polling at the time. Nine years later, as Americans lived through the next Republican presidency – Trump’s – Bush’s favorability rating had completely rebounded. With the Iraq War and the Great Recession in the rearview mirror – and with Bush, unlike Trump, out of politics – 61% of Americans had a favorable view of him.

Trump’s approval rating may have partially rebounded even though he is still very much in the political mix. More than half the country thought Trump should be removed from office after the January 6, 2021, insurrection, according to CNN polling at the time. His approval rating was just 34%. In the years since, as the shock of the attack on the US Capitol has faded and voters came to associate Biden with the White House and the trying years of the pandemic, views of Trump in hindsight have improved.

Now, more than half of registered voters in the Wall Street Journal poll of battleground states said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the job Trump did as president. That blur of hindsight is a huge advantage for Trump. Just 38% of registered voters in the Journal poll said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the job Biden is doing as president.

Biden is neck-and-neck with Trump among registered voters in those seven swing states on the question of protecting democracy. That should stun the White House since Biden has made protecting democracy, both in the US and abroad, the central tenet of his entire presidency."

USA TODAY

Early in 2023, President Joe Biden repeatedly used the phrase “Bidenomics” to connect his name to the economic policies at the time. The term was mocked and fell on deaf ears as voters were not feeling any relief at the gas pump or grocery store.

It got so bad that Biden dropped the use of the phrase “Bidenomics” in November 2023 because it was triggering a backlash and giving people a reason not to vote for him.

But today’s Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll of registered voters shows a marked improvement on views of the economy, and Biden’s handlers may want to dust off the shelved term “Bidenomics” and put it to use once again.

Suffolk University and USA TODAY have conducted 10 national surveys since Biden was elected. In fact, less than two years ago, just 9% of respondents in a July 2022 national poll described the U.S. economy as being in “economic recovery.”

Today’s poll puts that figure at 33%, and that nearly quadruple increase was seen among all voters, with some demographics showing bigger gains than others. Democrats who said we are experiencing an “economic recovery” rose from 20% in 2022 to 64% today. But the increase in sentiment even moved Republicans - from 1% to 8% today.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

So, who else moved? And which groups are feeling the most optimistic?

The poll, which was fielded after Biden’s State of the Union address Thursday night, saw a sizeable jump among older voters ages 65+ describing the economy as being in recovery, moving from 11% in 2022 to a significant 42% today.

They have seen their costs dropping and their retirement accounts rising dramatically due to new stock market highs. According to the poll, former President Donald Trump still leads Biden by a single point 44%-43%, slightly less than the 52%-47% Trump advantage among those ages 65+ from the 2020 exit polls.

Among self-described moderates (some of whom are moderate Democrats and elderly) there was a sizeable jump as well, from 8% to 41%. Moderates are the entry point to the most crucial voting bloc in a general election – independents. And among independents, there was a 19-point increase from 7% to 26%.

Not outstanding, but an improvement, nonetheless.

The good news for Biden is that 35% of independents now say the most important issue is the economy/inflation, while immigration and threats to democracy have dropped to 20% each. If independents continue to see the economy as improving and the economy/inflation remains the top issue, it could provide an opening for team Biden.

It won’t be an easy task, as independents don’t like Biden (63% view him unfavorably). They don’t like Trump either (56% unfavorable) but they rate his 2017-2020 term as much better (51% approve-44% disapprove) than Biden’s current term (32% approve-63% disapprove).

That’s why, among independents, Trump leads Biden by eight points, 32% to 24%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. garnering 18%, independent Cornel West at 6%, a No Labels candidate at 4%, a Libertarian Party candidate and the Green Party's Jill Stein at 3% each, and 9% undecided.

This is a dramatic reversal of the 13-point lead Biden held among independents in the 2020 exit polls. The presence of so many third-party candidates thus far has impacted not only voter share but also future behavior: 40% of independents say they might change their minds, considerably higher than the overall poll, which shows that 25% might switch.

The one issue where independents break from the overall poll findings is the Russia-Ukraine war: independents oppose (48%-44%) sending additional military aid to Ukraine, while all voters nationally support it (53%-39%).

To further complicate matters, support for Ukraine splits among independent men and women. Among independent men, additional Ukraine aid is opposed 51%-43%, while independent women support it 52%-39%. This presents a dilemma for Biden and the Democrats pushing hard for additional aid to Ukraine, yet need to court independents.

Reaching these independents will be difficult. They tend not to tune in and don’t follow current news events day to day. A majority (51%) said they did not watch the State of the Union address; 68% don’t plan to follow Trump’s upcoming hush money trial; and 75% say the country is on the wrong track.

Perhaps the only way to reach these voters is at the grocery store or gas pump.

The primary explanation for President Joe Biden’s disastrous polling has been that voters believe the economy has been poor. But as the economy keeps getting better and better, his polling has remained awful or even gotten worse.

The best response to this situation, I believe, is for Biden to make an affirmative case for his economic policies.

Last year, Biden unveiled a catchphrase, “Bidenomics,” to sell his program. Democrats went berserk with anger. Didn’t Biden know the state of the economy is unpopular? Why is he associating himself with something people don’t like? Biden accordingly stopped using the line and has scaled back economic themes in favor of attacks on Trump’s fitness and emphasizing abortion rights.

Those are important issues. But it is very hard for a president to win reelection if voters think the economy is bad.

That the economy is in such fantastic shape makes it all the more bizarre that Biden faces this dilemma. It is true that inflation spiked during the first two years of his presidency, and voters apparently have not forgiven him. Innumerable analyses have delved into the apparently fatal effect on the voters’ psyche that inflation has caused.

But inflation has fallen back to pre-COVID levels. Interest rates remain elevated, at least for the time being. Meanwhile, nearly everything else about the economy remains fantastic. Wages are growing much faster than price levels (which was not true earlier in Biden’s term). They are growing faster for low-income workers than for affluent ones. The unemployment rate is at historic lows.

It may be the case that voters will decide they care more about the COVID inflation surge than anything else that’s happening in the economy. But there’s no universal law of politics that says inflation is the only economic fact that matters to people, and people who are angry about inflation will continue to feel angry even after it stops.

During Donald Trump’s first term, it was common for analysts to explain his surprising victory by pointing to the slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis or to the long-standing stagnation of working-class wages. Working-class wages are sizzling right now. So it seems odd that inflation is now the be-all, end-all explanation for public opinion. Trump, moreover, has been able to escape blame for the economic and social conditions that happened in 2020, because he has made the case that it’s all the fault of the pandemic. Biden should try explaining why the inflation surge, which happened worldwide, isn’t his fault.

Perhaps public opinion is malleable and persistent efforts to educate and persuade the public can make headway. Biden has plenty of material to work with. He signed laws that are bringing down prescription-drug costs, making health insurance cheaper, and funding new factories and infrastructure. Donald Trump’s plan is to raise taxes on the working class and middle class (via a gigantic tariff) and cut them on the wealthy.

It’s possible none of this will work. But right now, while there’s plenty of time to change things, Biden’s campaign is in rough shape. What ought to be his greatest advantage is continuing to hurt him. That’s the thing he needs to change."

End of carousel It’s hard to answer the question of causality here, certainly, but it’s not hard at all to demonstrate the correlation. In October 2020, for example, we looked at polling showing that Fox News-watching Republicans were the most likely to view then-President Donald Trump’s administration positively.

More recently, The Washington Post and our partners at the Schar School conducted a national poll to test, among other things, what false beliefs Americans held. We presented several issues, including ones centered on the 2020 election, Russian interference in the 2016 election and climate change, and asked respondents to pick the accurate view of each. Republicans (and Republican-leaning independents) and those who said Fox News was one of their main sources for political news were much more likely than respondents overall to hold a false belief on the presented issues.

The overlap of those groups, Republicans who watched Fox News, were more likely still to hold false beliefs.

So which is it? Is Fox News reinforcing false beliefs or is it (as host Laura Ingraham once argued) simply not telling its audience what it didn’t want to hear?

Well, on Monday night, we got something of an answer as prime-time host Jesse Watters offered one a dishonest attack on President Biden and his administration.

Watters began by saying that the “entire Biden administration is a mirage.” Why? Because “we’re paying more for everything, but they tell us inflation’s down.”

The rate of inflation is, in fact, down relative to 2021 and 2022 though prices remain higher (given the lack of deflation).

“They tell us the economy’s great,” Watters continued, “but the jobs go to migrants.”

The greatness of the economy is certainly subjective, though unemployment is low and consumer confidence is up. The “jobs go to migrants” line is a good indication that the economy is doing well — it’s a way for Fox News and Republicans to diminish job growth by misleadingly presenting jobs data.

Watters continued: “Biden’s flying migrants straight into our airport so they can tell us border crossings are down.”

Again, no — this is just right-wing-bubble rhetoric.

But finally, Watters got to the point he wanted to make.

“Now they say there’s no crime wave,” he said. “But do you feel safe?”

What followed (after Watters warned viewers about the graphic footage they were about to see) was a montage of violent incidents caught on tape — three incidents, to be precise.

Share this article Share

“So if crime is everywhere,” Watters concluded, “why do they say crime is down?”

This is so stupid I’m annoyed I even have to think about it. It is stupid to show three crimes and then say crime is “everywhere.” It is also stupid to say that because something is “everywhere” there can’t be less of it. When the moon was obscuring the sun a few hours before Watters’s show, sunlight was still everywhere. So why would anyone say the moon was blocking it?

The answer to the question, though, is that people say crime is down because the best measures of crime indicate that crime is down. Those measures are deeply imperfect, it is true — and as I have written. I wrote about it before the 2022 midterms, for example, when Fox News was insisting without evidence that crime was surging. Watters called me a liar. Then the FBI finally released its slowly and incompletely collected data on crime, and we saw that the Fox hype was, in fact, unfounded.

Part of my argument in 2022 was that there was no uniform evidence that crime was up anymore than there was evidence that crime was down. The Bureau publishes annual assessments of crime aggregated from local police departments, but that’s spotty, particularly since the Bureau changed what it was collecting. It’s also belated, making it hard to evaluate national crime patterns in real-time — and making it very easy to cherry-pick incidents or numbers to fearmonger.

That brings us back to Watters in 2024.

“Why should we believe the FBI? Well, turns out we shouldn’t,” he said Monday. “The Washington Examiner did some digging and discovered the FBI has been cooking the books.” He asserted that the Biden administration was doing “Enron-style accounting” on crime.

The Examiner article to which he points does note flaws in the FBI’s data — something that Watters should presumably have been aware of since this has been a point of discussion for nearly two years. But it also makes a point that has been made countless times in recent months, a point that Watters tried to use as a gotcha.

“Murders are actually up 23 percent across 70 cities since 2019,” Watters announced triumphantly.

Yeah, man. No kidding. The point is that since 2021, murders are down according to the best national metrics.

This is just a basic Dunning-Kruger situation. Watters, who’s cherry-picked crime data for years, learns a little bit about it and decides that the whole system is rotten. He doesn’t yet know enough to know how little he knows. Nor, of course, does he have countervailing evidence, save those videos of those three incidents that purport to show how crime is “everywhere.”

Watters then interviewed Paul Mauro, a former New York Police Department inspector. He agreed with Watters: The system is rotten. There you go, confirmation.

We will leave you, though, with a snippet of the Mauro-Watters conversation that loops us back to our original question: Is Fox News driving misinformation or do those who embrace misinformation gravitate to Fox News?

“Do you think that the media knows what they’re doing?” Watters asked Mauro, implying that the news media was trying to cover up some hidden reality.

“Yeah. Of course,” Mauro replied. “There’s enough counter-reporting going out there so that they know, well, look, if we actually look at what’s taken place since Joe Biden took office, we’re not going to have the great storyline that we want here. So let’s just take what we know works for us, and we’re going to go with that.”

“It’s all a storyline with them,” Watters chimed in."

The term applies to a seemingly covert way for companies to raise prices by ever so slightly reducing the size of their products. There’s suddenly fewer pretzels in the bag, less toothpaste in the tube and shorter candy bars.

“It’s called shrinkflation,” Biden said in his State of the Union speech on Thursday night. “You get charged the same amount and you got about, I don’t know, 10% fewer Snickers in it.”

The president’s focus on shrinkflation is part of a broader strategy to reframe how voters think about the economy before the November election. Biden is trying to deflect criticism about high prices and instead pin the blame on big business.

He also is attempting to show everyday people that he’s fighting for them as he struggles to convince the public that the economy has strengthened under his leadership.

He talked about the shrinkflation issue in a video released on Super Bowl Sunday and highlighted a social media post by the “Sesame Street” character Cookie Monster that complained about smaller cookies.

The country’s low 3.7% unemployment rate and record 16 million applications to start new businesses have largely been overlooked by voters, who are dwelling on higher grocery and housing prices after inflation struck a four-decade high in June 2022 at 9.1%. Even as inflation has drifted down to 3.1% annually, shoppers are still worried about paying a premium at supermarkets.

“Joe Biden recognizes that high grocery prices are an ‘Achilles Heel’ politically,” said Ryan Bourne, an economist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. “When consumers are going into the grocery store, they remember that they’re paying more than they did in 2019.”

But Bourne cautioned that, in the alternative, companies might have simply raised their list prices without shrinkflation, possibly upsetting consumers more and hurting the president’s approval on the issue. Just 34% of U.S. adults say they agree with how Biden has handled the economy, according to polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

“A number of companies did that because they thought that their customers would prefer it to paying higher headline prices,” Bourne said. “So I think the president should be very careful what he wishes for when he says he thinks shrinkflation is unfair.”

Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, delivered the GOP response to the State of the Union and put the blame for inflation solely on Biden.

“His reckless spending dug our economy into a hole and sent the cost-of-living through the roof — the worst inflation in 40 years,” Britt said.

Republicans have claimed that prices jumped because of Biden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, even though the price increases were also global in nature. That’s a sign that broken supply chains and higher energy and food prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine played a role.

In a report published Wednesday, the liberal economic advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative dug into the inflation numbers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and documented the evidence of shrinkflation, finding it played a meaningful but modest role in higher prices since 2019.

More than 7% of the increase in coffee prices came from reduced packaging. About 10% of the higher prices for snacks and household paper products came from shrinkflation. And for a president who loves ice cream, about 7% of the inflation for that product came from shrinkflation.

Companies might have been masking the higher prices from customers, but they were straightforward with investors on earnings calls, the report said. Some companies such as General Mills have also portrayed the reduced package sizes as a way to manage their own costs and address the challenge of climate change.

The snack company Utz shaved its potato chip bags by half an ounce to 9 ounces, the report said. It trimmed two ounces worth of pretzels out of its pretzel jars, with the CEO heralding to stock analysts its ability to manage what the industry calls “price pack architecture.” PepsiCo reduced the size of its Frito Scoops bags, Gatorade bottles and Doritos bags.

“Why we’re seeing it now is because shrinkflation is late-stage ‘greedflation’ — when you’ve gone as far as you can go in increasing prices and consumers can’t take another increase,” said Linsday Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative. “It’s much more deceptive than a list price hike.”

Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, has introduced a bill that would ban shrinkflation by ordering the Federal Trade Commission to treat it as an unfair or deceptive practice, enabling the government to pursue civil penalties in court against companies that do so.

Biden gave the measure a full endorsement in his speech.

“Pass Bobby Casey’s bill and stop this,” he said."

“Let me just say one thing positive about where we are right now,” Stephen Moore told Fox Business.

“One thing that Biden said last night was true. It is true that the United States today has the strongest economy. There is no question about it.

“If you look at what’s happening in Europe today, Germany, Britain, France, if you look at Japan and China, they’re not growing. And so it is true … the way I like to put it is we are the least rotten apple in the cart and that’s something that’s important to cheer.”

It was a surprising statement from Moore, who Trump tried to put on the Federal Reserve board in 2019, only for widely reported issues arising from his tax and legal affairs to prompt his withdrawal.

A liberal watchdog recently labeled Moore an “extremist”, in relation to his work on Project 2025, a sprawling plan to stock the US government with rightwingers and reshape public policy should Trump defeat Biden in November.

A member of hard-right groups including the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks and the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, Moore is also a regular analyst for Fox.

On Friday, the Guardian asked Moore if he credited Biden for the strong economy, as was further expressed by strong February jobs numbers released that morning.

Moore said: “No I don’t credit Biden for the economy.

“It IS true that we have the strongest economy, but as I said, we are the least rotten apple in the cart. Most of the rest of the world is in recession.”

Asked who he did credit for such a strong US economy, if not the president who has supervised it for three years, Moore did not immediately reply.

Economic conditions are vital in every presidential election.

Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University in Washington who has correctly predicted the winner of each presidential election since 1984, said recently Biden was leading Trump on five key measures, one being long-term economic trends.

Nonetheless, as his rematch with Donald Trump gets into gear, Biden must combat polling showing voters do not believe the economy is working for them."

On Monday, the Biden administration pledged to provide up to $6.6 billion so that a Taiwanese semiconductor giant can expand the facilities it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the most-advanced microchips are produced domestically for the first time.

The funding is tied to a sweeping 2022 law that President Joe Biden has celebrated and which is designed to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Known as the CHIPS and Science Act, the $280 billion package is aimed at sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and manufacturing while minimizing the kinds of supply disruptions that occurred in 2021, after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when a shortage of chips stalled factory assembly lines and fueled inflation.

The Biden administration has promised tens of billions of dollars to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness."

President Joe Biden is expected to spend a large part of Thursday's State of the Union address addressing the economy as he renews his calls for increased taxes on corporations and billionaires, eliminating student debt and highlighting what he will call the economic rebound the U.S. has experienced since he became president.

Biden is also expected to tout other aspects of the economic recovery such as adding nearly 15 million jobs, rising wages, an unemployment rate below 4% for the past two years and an inflation rate that is steadily dropping.

""We were in the midst of a raging pandemic. Tens of millions of Americans were unemployed, hundreds of thousands of small businesses were at risk of closing and supply chains were badly broken,"" National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard said on a call previewing the speech.

The president is also expected to highlight his administration's efforts to crackdown on what it calls ""junk fees"" across a number of sectors -- from air travel, to concerts, banks, credit cards and health care and call out companies for ""shrinkflation.""

Biden will also push his plans to change the tax system by repeating his call to raise the corporate minimum tax to 28% and propose a 25% minimum tax for billionaires.

He will argue that the GOP plan would add more than $3 trillion to deficits over 10 years if the Trump tax cuts are made permanent as Republicans want, while providing tax cuts for those making over $4.5 million.

(AP) — President Joe Biden sought personally Tuesday to reengage voters in Nevada and Arizona who helped power his winning coalition in 2020 by drawing contrasts with Republican challenger Donald Trump on veterans, job creation, foreign policy and other issues.

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above.

Biden told supporters greeting him at a campaign office in Reno, Nevada, that he and Trump have a “different value set” and he criticized Trump for comments he’s made about veterans and others.

“I never heard a president say the things that he has said,” Biden said. He said millions of jobs disappeared during Trump’s presidency and that the Republican doesn’t understand foreign policy or U.S. national security needs.

Biden said Washoe County, where Reno is located, and Nevada are “really, really, really critical” for the November election. Nevada is among the roughly half-dozen battlegrounds that will determine the next president, and Washoe is the lone swing county in this state.

“We’re going to beat him again,” Biden said of Trump.

Biden also was stopping Tuesday in Las Vegas to promote his administration’s housing policies and Phoenix for another campaign appearance in a critical swing county paired with an event to discuss his support of the computer chip manufacturing sector.

His arrival in Reno coincided with the launch of Latinos con Biden-Harris (Spanish for Latinos with Biden-Harris). Campaign ads ran in English, Spanish and Spanglish, a blend of the two languages, as did two Spanish-language radio interviews with the president. Biden is also emphasizing his pro-union, pro-abortion rights message during the trip.

“The Latino community is critical to the value set we have,” Biden said on “El Bueno, la Mala y el Feo” (“The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”) on Univision Radio. “I plan on working like the devil to earn your support.”

In the Univision interview, Biden turned questions about immigration into an indictment of Trump for calling migrants “animals” and saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the U.S. Biden also noted Trump’s pledge to carry out mass deportations if given another term.

“We have to stop this guy, we can’t let this happen,” Biden said. “We are a nation of immigrants.”

Biden’s push with Latino voters is part of the campaign’s broader efforts to lay the groundwork to reengage various constituencies that will be critical to his reelection bid. That effort is all the more crucial as key parts of Biden’s base, such as Black and Hispanic adults, have become increasingly disenchanted with his performance in office.

In an AP-NORC poll conducted in February, 38 percent of U.S. adults approved of how Biden was handling his job. Nearly 6 in 10 Black adults (58 percent) approved, compared to 36 percent of Hispanic adults. Black adults are more likely than white and Hispanic adults to approve of Biden, but that approval has dropped in the three years since Biden took office.

Biden’s reelection campaign, along with allied Democratic groups, has opened offices in Washoe County and in specific areas of Las Vegas that aides said will help the campaign with Black, Latino and Asian American voters. The president said Tuesday that his campaign will open more offices in the state, and Daniel Corona, the campaign’s deputy political coalitions director, said Biden’s reelection effort was hiring a political director to focus on rural parts of the state.

Bilingual campaign organizers are already in place in Arizona, and the campaign has opened an office in Maryvale, a major Latino community in Phoenix. The campaign has hired more than 40 staffers in Nevada and Arizona.

Campaign officials believe that tuned-out voters are starting to pay attention to the reality of a rematch between Biden and Trump now that they have clinched their respective nominations. They’re trying to boost coalition-building efforts in battleground states now that the matchup is set, using the energy coming out of Biden’s State of the Union address this month to jolt their campaign momentum.

Latinos con Biden-Harris will formally launch at Biden’s Phoenix stop and include other campaign events, such as volunteer trainings and house parties, in other battleground states including Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin later this week. The campaign already has similar groups geared toward women and college students.

“This isn’t stuff that you can just stand up. This is stuff that requires work,” Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Biden campaign, said in an interview. “It does require training. It does require making sure that your volunteers and supporters have what they need on the ground.”

Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee dismissed dozens of staffers after new leaders closely aligned with Trump took over last week. Those let go include people who worked at the party’s community centers that helped build relationships with minority groups in some Democratic-leaning areas. The committee’s new leadership has since insisted that those centers will remain open.

Still, the Biden campaign and the broader Democratic Party are confronting their own struggles, despite their organizational advantages. On top of Biden’s weaker job performance numbers, Democrats are seeing less support from key voting blocs come election time: While Biden won 63 percent of Hispanic voters in 2020, that percentage shrunk to 57 percent for Democratic candidates in the 2022 midterms, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the national electorate.

Biden campaign officials say they are confident that once the contrast between the president’s agenda and Trump’s plans for a second term are presented to disillusioned members of Biden’s coalition, they will ultimately back the president.

Alongside the campaign stops, the administration is pairing official White House events on matters that resonate in the two states.

In Arizona, Biden will discuss a law he signed encouraging domestic manufacturing of computer chips, which has spurred significant private investment in the state, especially in Phoenix.

In Nevada, he will promote a proposal to offer a mortgage relief credit to first-time homebuyers and a seller’s tax credit to encourage homeowners to offload their starter homes.

Biden is scheduled to close the trip at a trio of fundraisers in Dallas and Houston.

It jeopardizes the American economy and our energy security. It’s a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin that will harm our European allies. Here is the truth about Biden’s LNG export ban:

MYTH: DOE needs to ban LNG export permits and conduct more studies.

FACT: The Department of Energy (DOE) has already commissioned five studies to examine the effects of U.S. LNG exports. The results unanimously demonstrate the benefits to the U.S. economy and domestic natural gas prices. DOE has also issued two studies that examined the life cycle greenhouse gas impacts of U.S. LNG exports showing strong environmental benefits. Notably, the two prior presidential administrations conducted these studies without blocking export permits.

MYTH: Banning American LNG Exports is good for the environment.

FACT: Clean natural gas is a major reason why the U.S. has reduced emissions more than any other nation. DOE has already studied the climate impacts of U.S. LNG exports, and their reports clearly show the environmental benefits. According to DOE, U.S. LNG exports are also 41% cleaner than Russian natural gas delivered to Europe.

MYTH: The decision to ban U.S. LNG export permits will not impact our ability to supply our allies.

FACT: The indefinite ban has already disrupted global energy markets and discouraged our allies in Europe who are desperately seeking to eliminate their dependence on Russian natural gas. In December 2023, more than 87% of U.S. LNG exports went to the European Union, United Kingdom, or Asian markets. Furthermore, U.S. LNG helped reduce natural gas prices in Europe by over 83% from 2022 levels following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our European allies are rapidly constructing new LNG import facilities to wean themselves off of Russian natural gas. The decision to ban exports is sending the signal that America is not a dependable trading partner and undercuts our efforts to help Europe.

MYTH: Banning American LNG Exports will lower domestic energy prices.

FACT: Domestic natural gas prices are lower and more stable with free trade and open markets. The decision to ban exports creates uncertainty and discourages investments that would otherwise create jobs and expand the supply of natural gas. Banning LNG exports will actually mean higher prices at home for Americans. We need more American energy production to lower prices—not President Biden’s export ban.

MYTH: Banning American LNG exports will be good for the economy.

FACT: According to the American Petroleum Institute, increasing LNG exports could add as much as $73 billion to the U.S. economy and upwards of 453,000 American jobs by 2040. Removing restrictions on LNG will allow the U.S. to export more and encourage domestic production, which will reduce American energy supply vulnerabilities. Increasing LNG exports will also encourage investments in other industries, like manufacturing, which will help ensure we beat China.

Poll after poll has shown that most voters do not believe him. That may be changing.

After months of resilient hiring, better-than-expected economic growth and a declining rate of inflation, new data shows that Americans are becoming upbeat about the US economy, potentially reversing the deep pessimism Biden has struggled to counter for much of the past three years.

That trend could reshape campaigning ahead of November’s presidential election, in which Biden is expected to face off against Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Experts believe the president’s case for a second term will benefit from more optimistic views of the economy – but the hangover from the inflation wave that peaked a year and a half ago presents Republicans with a potent counterattack.

Our polling shows that it’s perfectly OK to acknowledge that there has been pain, and there’s more business to do Adam Green

“Over the last couple of years, people have been feeling the most pain on day-to-day spending, on things like groceries and gas prices and prescription drugs. And, fortunately, those prices are beginning to come down, which gives Democrats a stronger hand than we had just a few months ago,” said Adam Green, co-founder of advocacy group the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

“For a campaign that says that they want to finish the unfinished business of the Biden presidency, our polling shows that it’s perfectly OK to acknowledge that there has been pain, and there’s more business to do,” said Green.

He added that the Biden campaign should “really focus the voters’ attention on the forward-looking agenda of one party wanting to help billionaires and corporations, and the Democratic party wanting to challenge corporate greed and bring down prices for consumers”.

Biden has been unpopular with voters, according to poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight, even as employment grew strongly and the economy avoided the recession that many economists predicted was around the corner. While it’s not the only factor, pollsters have linked voters’ disapproval with Biden to the wave of price increases that peaked in June 2022 at levels not seen in more than four decades, and which have since been on the decline. An NBC News poll released this month showed Biden trailing Trump by about 20 points on the question of which candidate would better handle the economy, a finding echoed by other surveys.

But new data appears to show Americans believe the economy has turned a corner. Late last month, the Conference Board reported its index of consumer confidence had hit its highest point since December 2021, while the University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment has climbed to its highest level since July of that year.

“The people who give positive views of the economy, they tend to point to, the unemployment rate is low, and they also point to that inflation is down from where it was,” said Jocelyn Kiley, an associate director at Pew Research Center, whose own data has found an uptick in positive economic views, particularly among Democrats.

Trump and his Republican allies have capitalized on inflation to argue that Biden should be voted out, though economists say Biden’s policies are merely one ingredient in a trend exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and global supply chain snarls that occurred as a result of Covid-19. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who is the last major challenger to the former president still in the race has said the economy is “crushing middle-class Americans”.

But voters’ improving views of the economy could blunt those attacks ahead of the November election, where the GOP is also hoping to seize control of the Senate from Biden’s Democratic allies and maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Lynn Vavreck, an American politics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Trump might have to fall back to tried-and-true tactics from his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton, such as promising to institute hardline immigration policies.

“The economy is growing. People don’t really say that they feel good about it, but if you’re gonna load up your campaign on those people’s feelings, I feel like that’s a little risky,” said Vavreck, who has studied how economic conditions can affect presidential campaigns.

“You could do that, and that would be a bit of a gamble, or you could find an issue on which you believe you are closer to most voters than Joe Biden, that is not about the economy, and you could try to reorient the conversation around that issue.”

There is already evidence that harnessing outrage over the flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States is key to Trump’s campaign strategy. The former president’s meddling was a factor in the death of a rare bipartisan agreement in Congress to tighten immigration policy in exchange for Republican votes to approve assistance for Ukraine and Israel’s militaries.

Consumers go to the grocery store, and they spend money, and they’re upset with what things cost Doug Heye

With the economy humming along, Trump is apparently nervous that the US economy could enter a recession at an inconvenient moment. “When there’s a crash, I hope it’s going to be during this next 12 months because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover,” he said in an interview last month, referring to the US president who is often blamed for the Great Depression that began 95 years ago.

Even though the rate of inflation has eased, albeit haltingly, prices for many consumer goods remain higher than they were compared with when Biden took office, which his opponents can still capitalize on, said the Republican strategist Doug Heye.

“Consumers go to the grocery store, and they spend money, and they’re upset with what things cost, and that should always be what they’re talking about,” Heye said.

While Biden has been quick to take credit for the strong hiring figures during his administration, polls show that hasn’t landed with voters. In recent months, the White House has shifted strategy, announcing efforts to get rid of junk fees and accusing corporations of “price gouging”.

Evan Roth Smith, head pollster for the Democratic research firm Blueprint, said that lines up with his findings that voters care less about job growth and more about the fact that everything costs more.

“Voters just felt a prioritization mismatch between what they were experiencing, the kind of pressures they were under, which isn’t that they didn’t have jobs, it’s that they couldn’t pay their bills,” Smith said.

“Makes all the sense in the world that if the White House and president and the Biden campaign are touting this stuff, that they are going to make headway, and are making headway with voters in getting them to feel like Joe Biden in the Democratic party do understand.”"

There is no denying the numbers: The United States currently enjoys the highest rate of economic growth among nations in the G7, the lowest inflation, and the strongest wage growth. The unemployment rate hasn’t been this low for this long in half a century. Even accounting for inflation, wages are higher today than they were before the coronavirus pandemic, and the biggest wage gains have accrued among the lowest-paid workers, resulting in a dramatic reduction in overall wage inequality. The economy is even outperforming among communities that are often excluded from boom-time gains. Biden has overseen the lowest Black unemployment rate on record and the lowest ever unemployment rate for workers with disabilities. The American economy isn’t perfect, but by any historical standard it is very, very good.

So, it’s remarkable that Biden finds himself needing to do so much persuasion on the campaign trail. Voter views on the economy are modestly improving, but survey after survey reveals a disconnect between the country’s economic performance and public sentiment. A recent USA Today poll shows that only one-third of voters believe that the economy is currently in “recovery.”

Economists and political messaging gurus have been trying to explain this for some time now, and while there are subtle differences among their various explanations, most ultimately argue that voters really, truly do not like inflation and are also a little confused when they talk about the economy.

There is surely something to both of these ideas—but there is a distinctly political tenor to Biden’s trouble on the economy that defies material conditions. Macroeconomic metrics have been improving steadily for a long time now—inflation peaked all the way back in the summer of 2022—and for much of that period, voter assessments of Biden’s performance actually deteriorated as the economy strengthened. Even today, when some voters say they like the economy, they remain reluctant to give Biden credit for it.

Much of this scenario can be laid at the feet of the Democratic Party. Not the official fundraising and administrative apparatus that runs conventions and formulates policy platforms, but the broad constellation of think tanks, nonprofits, academic experts, and journalists that collectively regulates the liberal intellectual atmosphere. For much of his presidency, Biden has been the victim of a centrist revolt against his economic program that the progressive wing of the party has been either unable or unwilling to put down. Everyone expects Republicans to give a Democratic president a hard time, but sharp and sustained economic criticism from Biden’s ostensible allies established a narrative of failure that has proved alarmingly resistant to reality.

Biden frequently draws distinctions between himself and the progressive left on police reform, immigration, and other issues where he thinks liberal ideas don’t fit the national mood. But this is not the way he has handled economic policy. From his first day in the Oval Office, Biden has embraced nearly every progressive criticism of Barack Obama’s approach to the economy, and translated those critiques into policy. Obama scoffed at labor unions; Biden walked a picket line and appointed the most pro-worker National Labor Relations Board in decades. Obama’s Education Department screwed over student debtors; Biden has canceled $138 billion in student debt. Obama defended big business; Biden has been an antitrust warrior. Obama was a free trader, while Biden subsidizes domestic manufacturing. Obama offered to cut Social Security; Biden just torched Republicans during his State of the Union for planning the same thing.

The list goes on. But the most important economic distinction between Biden and Obama is on crisis relief. The unemployment rate was high and rising when Obama entered office, escalating to 9 percent by April 2009, a level it would not retreat below for more than two years. When jobs did eventually return, most of those that were created paid poverty wages. The abysmal labor market made his presidency synonymous with the Great Recession.

The chief lesson Biden’s advisers took from this miserable experience was that the government didn’t spend enough in Obama’s 2009 stimulus package to get unemployment under control. More money would have meant more jobs, and more jobs would have put upward pressure on wages.

So Biden opted to spend much bigger out of the gate—$1.9 trillion to Obama’s $800 billion—and continued to secure additional rounds of support right up to the 2022 midterms. Obama began calling for budget cuts with unemployment still stuck above 9 percent, but Biden never pivoted to austerity, and ultimately secured well over $1 trillion in additional public investment after his initial stimulus bill had been enacted.

All this fiscal support resulted in a much stronger labor market. The unemployment rate fell below 5 percent by September 2021—a level Obama did not enjoy until the final days of his presidency—amid record wage growth for low-income workers. The economy never recovered all the manufacturing jobs it lost during the Wall Street crash. Biden had recovered all of those lost in the COVID collapse by May 2022. The COVID crash was sharper, deeper, and more physically disruptive to global trade than the 2008 Wall Street meltdown was, but the U.S. economy rebounded faster, stronger, and more equitably thanks to Biden’s more aggressive relief effort.

But not everyone was happy about this strategy at the time. When Biden signed his first economic relief bill into law in March 2021, former Obama adviser Larry Summers declared it “the least responsible macroeconomic policy we’ve had in the last 40 years” and upbraided “the Democratic left” for preventing a smaller package. All this spending, Summers claimed, risked a run of inflation. People were going to have too much money on their hands, and this excess spending power would lead to higher prices that made everyone poorer. When prices did indeed begin rising in the second half of 2021, the business press hailed Summers as a prophet, and a host of liberal commentators began tipping their hats to him.

Inflation arrived when the national mood was already in the toilet. Deadly car accidents were up, road rage incidents were soaring, and murder rates were rising. More people died from COVID-19 in 2021 than in 2020, even though vaccines were widely available. In monthly Gallup polling, Biden’s approval rating fell from 56 percent in June 2021 to 40 percent in January 2022, and all of this negativity made progressive institutions increasingly reluctant to claim credit for his approach to economic relief. Voters didn’t seem to care about Biden’s strong labor market—they were mad about inflation and everything else.

And so the economic commentary field remained open to Summers and other expert doomsayers—including some with politics well to Summers’ left. Economics dominated the news cycle in a way that it hadn’t since the banking crash, and seemingly everyone had something terrible to say about it. Biden wasn’t creating enough union jobs. His spending was really just a corporate welfare extravaganza. He was stealing jobs from Europe. There were too many regulations on manufacturers. There weren’t enough regulations on manufacturers. A recession was coming. A recession was already here. Some high-profile Democrats even insisted that a recession was necessary—on CNBC, former Obama and Clinton adviser Jason Furman argued that millions of workers would have to be laid off to get inflation back under control. Summers even floated the possibility of 10 percent unemployment.

To give all these haters their due, it really is hard to understand what is happening in the economy in real time, and even the best economists sometimes make predictions that look silly in retrospect. But what is remarkable about the Biden era is the degree to which critics on the left, right, and center basically agreed with one another beneath all the ideological dross. Almost everyone had come up with a way to argue that Biden had engaged in wasteful spending that left ordinary people behind.

Almost everyone. Throughout all this ugliness, a niche discourse continued in the econosphere about whether Summers had correctly nailed the cause of inflation. If Americans really were victims of overspending, then the only way to get inflation back down would indeed be to cause a recession. The problem, according to Summers and Furman, was that everyone had too much money. The solution was to take that money away.

But another camp argued that this was the wrong way to look at an economy that had just emerged from a massive shock like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this telling, inflation was driven not so much by an excess of consumer demand as by a dearth of product supply. It was a lot harder to make and distribute a whole host of goods when businesses around the world kept shutting down, and even once everything had fully reopened, it took a long time for companies to reestablish sources and connections. If supply shortages were indeed responsible for higher prices, then Biden’s spending was a feature, not a bug—it was the only thing standing between American households and the economic abyss.

Many economic disputes are vague enough to allow for essentially endless ideological stalemate over statistics, but in this case, a straightforward real-world test was available. Summers and Furman were arguing that layoffs were the only way to bring inflation down. If inflation fell without a flood of layoffs, then the rest of their diagnosis would have to fall with it.

In the American economy, policymakers typically induce job losses through the Federal Reserve. When the Fed raises interest rates, it’s trying to tamp down inflation by creating job losses: Higher rates mean higher business costs, and businesses lay people off in order to remain profitable. This was the Fed’s strategy when it began hiking rates in spring 2022.

The layoffs, however, refused to materialize. When inflation peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022, the unemployment rate stood at 3.6 percent. Today, using the same metrics, inflation is just 3.2 percent, and unemployment is at just 3.9 percent. For 12 of the previous 19 months, the jobless rate has held steady at or below its June 2022 level, while inflation has been running below 4 percent since June 2023. Economists are still debating why the Fed’s higher rates didn’t translate into job losses, but the important point is that millions of people were not, in fact, fired. Moreover, millions of people did not need to be fired in order to fix inflation. As Mike Konczal concluded in a report for the Roosevelt Institute in September 2023, the vast majority of inflation during the Biden years was driven by pandemic-related supply problems. Whatever was going wrong in 2022, it wasn’t because you were too rich.

There is some evidence that the economic commentariat is coming to its senses as the 2024 election approaches. Some of the same centrists who ripped Biden’s stimulus package in 2021 are now applauding his recovery. The anti-Biden left has largely abandoned the economic playing field, finding cleaner grounds for criticism on other subjects. Contrary to the narrative abuse directed at Biden over the past few years, the economic numbers across his presidency tell a simple, optimistic story about the art of government in the democratic world. The American economy is strong today for the same reason that the labor market has been strong throughout Biden’s presidency: the U.S. government spent a ton of money to support workers and their families. Biden has not only established a blueprint for successful crisis management, but he has achieved something on the economy that pessimists across the ideological spectrum have been declaring impossible for much of the 21st century: He learned from the government’s prior mistakes and found a way to govern better."
472,Fact check: Is Biden or Trump better for the US economy? - DW (English),Fact check: Is Biden or Trump better for the US economy?  DW (English),"Sat, 06 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWlzLWJpZGVuLW9yLXRydW1wLWJldHRlci1mb3ItdGhlLXVzLWVjb25vbXkvYS02ODc1NTE4MdIBV2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmR3LmNvbS9lbi9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWlzLWJpZGVuLW9yLXRydW1wLWJldHRlci1mb3ItdGhlLXVzLWVjb25vbXkvYS02ODc1NTE4MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,DW (English),"Who is the more economically competent, Trump or Biden? One has public opinion on his side; the data supports the other. DW examined four claims about growth, inflation, debt and the US stock market.

The opinion research institute YouGov has found that, with regard to the economy, a majority of the US population has greater faith in Donald Trump than in the incumbent president, Joe Biden. Only 26% of the voters canvassed by the institute in February of this year considered Biden a capable economic policymaker. By contrast, Trump reaches approval ratings of 47%.

But do the survey results align with US economic data?

Booming economy?

Claim: ""Biden is destroying law and order, and our economy is in a free fall. Under Donald Trump … our economy was strong. We need four more years of Donald J. Trump,"" US Senator Tim Scott wrote on X on March 28. Other X users also hark back to the ""booming economy"" under Trump.

DW Fact Check: Misleading

The first three years under Donald Trump were economically promising, with growth rates of over 2% (see graph). This does not, however, constitute a sustained ""boom"". The definition of a boom is a period characterized by ""a pronounced increase in economic activity, reflected in high growth rates, significantly above-normal capacity utilization, noticeable employment growth, and a bullish stock market.""

Trump started his first term in office on January 20, 2017, with US economic growth at 2.4%. In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the economy declined by 2.2%, then recovered in the final quarter, surging to 5.8%.

The economy is not ""in free fall"" under Biden, as US Senator Scott has claimed. It has stabilized at a growth rate of around 2% (see graph), with growth of 2.1% predicted for 2024 .

Conclusion: The comparison shows that the US has not experienced an economic boom under either Trump or Biden. Rather, it has been struggling to deal with the economic consequences of severe crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

Rising national debt

Claim: ""In the last four years, reckless spending has driven the national debt past $34 trillion."" This accusation was made by the Trump-aligned organization Americans for Prosperity , whose website supposedly offers a ""fact check"" of Biden's economic policy.

DW Fact Check: Misleading

It is true that, according to official sources, US public debt rose to a historic high of 34 trillion dollars in the fourth quarter of 2023. This corresponds to 124% of US GDP.

However, it is also true that, proportionally, the national debt increased more under Trump's presidency than under Biden. Between 2017 and 2021, under Trump, outstanding debt rose from $19.84 trillion to $28.13 trillion — an increase of 41.62%.

Under Biden, debt rose from $28.13 trillion to $34 trillion in December 2023 — an increase of 20.86%.

Contrary to the claim of Americans for Prosperity, which accuses Biden of ""reckless spending,"" the US Department of the Treasury blames two main factors for this development: additional spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, as well as a simultaneous drop in tax revenues.

Tax revenues decreased not only because of the economic downturn during the pandemic, but also as a result of Trump's 2018 tax reform. This is a fact his followers like to suppress.

The reform reduced corporate taxes from an average of 35% to 21%. Income tax rates were also lowered. The increase in government spending was financed by taking on debt.

Conclusion: Trump shares the responsibility for the rising national debt.

Biden and inflation

Claim: ""Joe Biden unleashed inflation on America, at record levels, and it doesn't go away."" This accusation was made by Glenn Allen Youngkin, governor of the US state of Virginia, in an interview with the broadcaster Fox News on March 21, 2024.

DW Fact Check: False

The statement ignores important statistical data, because it fails to mention that the inflation rate in the United States has been steadily dropping for a year (see graph).

According to the White House , the rate in 2023 was 3.4%. In February, it dropped to 3.2% compared to the same month last year. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the rate stood at 8% .

When Trump took office in 2017, inflation was at 2.1%. It dropped to 1.2% in 2020, but rose during the COVID-19 pandemic to 4.6% in 2021.

Conclusion: The real causes of rising inflation are COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which caused energy prices to explode — not Biden's economic policy.

Stock market high

Claim: ""This is the Trump stock market because my polls against Biden are so good that investors are projecting that I will win, and that will drive the market up."" Trump made this claim on his network Truth Social on January 29, 2024, in response to a US stock market high.

DW Fact Check: False

In fact, over the past year, between April 2023 and April 2024, the S&P 500 stock index rose by 27 percent.

Along with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq, the S&P 500 is the third major US stock market indicator. It includes the 500 largest stock-exchange-listed companies in the United States.

The boom in the US stock market has less to do with Trump's poll ratings and more with the interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve (FED). The US stock market recovery began in late 2023, when the FED chairman, Jerome Powell, hinted that the historic tightening of monetary policy was probably over, as inflation was falling faster than expected.

On April 3, 2024, Powell stated that, given the good development of the US economy, and ""if the economy evolves broadly as we expect,"" a rate cut could be forthcoming at some point this year.

According to analysts, other factors have also contributed to the stock market high, such as ""optimism with regard to artificial intelligence.""

Conclusion: Trump's post indicates inflated self-esteem rather than economic competence.

But the newly released USA Today/Suffolk University poll also shows views of the economy have hit their highest level of Biden’s presidency, a sign that voters may be starting to agree with the president that his policies helped the country recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Biden and Trump on Tuesday clinched the final delegates they needed to win the Democratic and Republican nominations, respectively, with primary victories in Washington state, Mississippi and Georgia. They will be officially named the nominees at their party’s conventions over the summer, but by all indications, Americans are not looking forward to the first rematch between presidential candidates in almost seven decades.

Polls have repeatedly shown both men are unpopular with voters, but the USA Today/Suffolk University survey finds Trump has a slight advantage over Biden nationally, with 40% of voters preferring him over the president’s 38%.

And while unfavorability ratings for both men are 55%, the poll finds Republicans are more fired up about a second Trump presidency than Democrats are for another four years of Biden. Forty-three per cent of Republicans say they are “excited” about Trump’s nomination, versus 22% of Democrats about Biden.

Biden’s approval ratings have been underwater for more than two and a half years, and the dip roughly coincided with the intensification of inflation that accompanied the economy’s bounceback from the mass layoffs and business closures caused by Covid-19.

While the White House has tried to redirect voters’ attention to the strong labor market, ebbing rate of price growth and the potential offered by Biden’s legislative accomplishment, views of the economy specifically have remained negative.

But the USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows that voters are becoming less pessimistic. A third of registered voters believe the economy is recovering, the highest share saying that since Biden took office, the survey says.

“This data point is particularly important to track. If the trend continues, more voters could connect the economic recovery to President Biden, especially if the economy continues to dominate other issues as we get closer to November,” David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, said.

Democrats were also cheered by Biden’s performance at the annual State of the Union address last week. The president laid into Trump in a passionate speech that, for some of his allies, quieted fears about the 81-year-old Biden being too old to campaign effectively.

But it didn’t do much to move the needle among the poll’s respondents. While a majority watched the speech, they were nearly evenly split on whether it improved or worsened their views of Biden, and 39% said it made no difference at all."

As President Joe Biden barnstorms battleground states this week, he is framing the debate with former President Donald Trump around themes of economic populism that Democrats have employed, often with success, for decades. But Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, may prove to be a more elusive target for those arguments than a typical GOP candidate.

Biden is portraying himself as committed to standing up for average Americans against powerful interests and the wealthy. But polls consistently show that significantly more Americans, including substantial numbers of Black and Hispanic voters, believe they personally benefited from Trump’s policies than Biden’s.

That sentiment risks blunting Biden’s populist arguments: even if he can convince voters that Trump’s policies helped the rich and corporations the most, they may not mind as much if they believe that they also benefited more under Trump than they have under Biden.

For Biden – who spent Tuesday meeting with Teamsters leaders and is headed to Wisconsin and Michigan the next two days – the critical question may be whether voters’ support for key ideas in his policy agenda can outweigh their frustration with their lived economic experience during his presidency. “You are really hitting on the crux of what a lot of swing votes will be [weighing] going into the election,” said Democratic pollster Danielle Deiseroth.

Biden has plenty of ammunition to mount a traditional populist case against Trump. The former president’s principal legislative accomplishment was a massive tax cut that provided most of its direct benefits to corporations and the most affluent. Trump came within one Senate vote of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which has significantly increased health care coverage for lower-income working Americans. As a candidate in 2016, Trump pledged to seek legislative authority for Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices from pharmaceutical companies, but in office, under intense pressure from the industry, he abandoned that promise. Across a wide range of regulatory issues, from the environment to consumer protection, his administration consistently sided with business interests.

Biden has set a very different course. He won the legislative authority for Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors, and his administration is now negotiating lower prices for the first 10 drugs under that program; he also won authority to limit seniors’ monthly costs for insulin to $35 per month and to cap seniors’ annual out-of-pocket expenses for all drugs at $2,000. He passed significantly larger subsidies to help the uninsured buy coverage under the ACA, which has pushed enrollment to record highs. His administration has enforced the antitrust laws more aggressively than any in recent times and pursued a multi-pronged regulatory offensive against what he calls junk fees. The Covid-19 stimulus bill passed in 2021 included an expansion of the tax credit for families with children big enough to cut childhood poverty roughly in half, though the credit expired when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin insisted on its removal in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden did pass in that law a new 15% minimum tax for corporations.

At the same time, the tax incentives for domestic clean energy manufacturing included in the Inflation Reduction Act and separate legislation promoting more domestic production of semiconductors, as well as the thousands of projects funded under the bipartisan infrastructure bill, have set off a boom in blue-collar employment with nearly 1.6 million jobs created in construction and manufacturing alone since Biden took office, according to administration figures. Biden also became the first president to walk a picket line when he joined the United Auto Workers during its strike against the nation’s three largest automakers.

The new proposals Biden highlighted in his State of the Union last week and new federal budget released Monday also lean heavily into economic populism. “Overall, issues that economic populists have worked for years to put into the political mainstream got validated by President Biden,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Biden is proposing to raise the corporate tax rate, impose a 25% minimum tax on billionaires and end the Trump tax cuts for families earning over $400,000 per year (while retaining them for those making less). He wants to restore the expanded children’s tax credit, make permanent the larger subsidies for buying health insurance, provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, establish a nationwide paid family leave program, and subsidize families’ child care expenses, partly by establishing universal access to preschool. He also called for increasing five-fold annually the number of drugs subject to Medicare negotiations, and to extend the caps on insulin and out-of-pocket drug costs to all Americans, not just seniors.

Biden’s agenda, and the contrast it establishes with Trump’s policy priorities, gives Democrats plenty to work with in trying to portray themselves as champions of average families and Republicans as servants of the wealthy. “Our economic contrast is going to be that of Scranton, Pennsylvania, versus Park Avenue,” said Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director. “We have the receipts because we are also running against a de facto incumbent. We saw what his economic policy looked like when he was in office and we have to clearly articulate that to people and remind people of what his priorities are.”

The campaign, for instance, immediately denounced comments Trump made to CNBC Monday in which the former president signaled openness to cutting Medicare and Social Security. (Trump’s camp fired back by noting Biden also supported reductions in the programs to reduce the deficit at various points in his long Senate career.)

But inflation, and its impact on the ability of working families to meet their bills, has greatly complicated Biden’s task in winning a conventional populist argument against Trump. Inflation has significantly moderated from its peak immediately after the Covid pandemic, but while prices are no longer increasing as fast, they remain about 18% higher than when Biden took office, and higher than that for such essentials as groceries, gas and rent. And while wages have been rising faster than prices since spring 2023, the cumulative increase in pay has not yet surpassed the cumulative increase in prices during Biden’s presidency, leaving many workers feeling squeezed. “What’s the disconnect between people’s experience and the [positive] economic movement that we’ve seen in the last four or five months?” asked Republican pollster Micah Roberts. “It’s three words: In-fla-tion. That’s it. It’s not a hard thing.”

Pollsters in both parties say it is common in focus groups to hear participants say that they felt they had more money in their pocket at the end of the week when Trump was president. “Right before Covid, people were telling us it was the best economy they had seen in their lifetime,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump. Now, he says, “They specifically blame Joe Biden for” their increased difficulty making ends meet. “Stand outside a grocery store,” McLaughlin added, “they’ll tell you how booming the economy is.”

Polls leave little doubt Biden today is not only losing the economic comparison to Trump, but facing substantial skepticism among constituencies that usually are the principal target for a populist Democratic economic message. In a CNBC poll last October, not only did White voters say they were better off financially under Trump than Biden by a margin of more than 4-to-1, but so did non-white voters by a margin of nearly 2-to-1, according to figures provided by Roberts, whose firm conducts the survey with a Democratic partner. In the latest national NBC News poll, conducted by the same Republican-Democratic partnership, voters who identified as low-income and working-class trusted Trump over Biden on the economy by a crushing margin of 61% to 25%.

Biden’s problems on the economy are especially acute with Hispanics. In a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, the Hispanic share of voters who said Trump’s policies had helped them personally was more than double the share who said that about Biden’s agenda. In the latest CBS News/YouGov national survey, the share of Hispanics who said the economy was excellent or good under Trump was 20 percentage points higher than the share who said the same about it under Biden. In 2020, Biden won about three-fifths of Hispanics, but in the CBS poll the share of Hispanics who said Trump fights for people like them virtually equaled the percentage that said Biden did. A majority of Hispanics, and even a plurality of Black voters, said Biden’s policies would cause inflation to rise, the survey found.

Roberts said a major part of Biden’s problem on the economy is voters have such a concrete comparison available in their memories of the Trump record before the pandemic.

“I think Trump’s messaging is really simple: we had a policy of creating domestic energy and becoming energy leaders; Biden on day one changed that and look what happened,” Roberts said. “We weren’t spending three trillion dollars on amorphous things that nobody can really put their fingers on. Biden did that, and look what happened to inflation. We had a policy that was strong on the border and immigration. On day one, Biden changed that and look what happened to our border – and by the way, that has economic impact. You can’t not make the contrast and comparison.”

These negative retrospective assessments of the Biden and Trump economic records create huge headwinds for the president. His campaign, and Democrats more broadly, hope to overcome them primarily by stressing their prospective priorities for a second term. “This is not simply a retrospective comparison; this is also a comparison about the competing visions of the future,” Tyler said.

Democrats point out that multiple polls show broad public support for almost all of the key agenda items Biden highlighted in the State of the Union and resistance to many Republican priorities, such as extending tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations or repealing the Affordable Care Act. “Voters—even past Biden voters who disapprove of his economic record—clearly reject what Trump and Republicans are offering,” Democratic pollster Margie Omero said in an email.

In a report released last week, the Winning Jobs Narrative Project, a consortium of liberal advocacy groups, concluded that Democrats’ best chance to overcome voters’ continuing concerns about meeting their bills is to hammer home the populist case Biden sketched out in the State of the Union. By framing the election as a choice between “middle-out” versus “top down” and “trickle down” economics, “we think the president is absolutely on to something central to the direction Democrats should take in this election – which is who gets prioritized and how,” said Bobby Clark, a senior adviser to the group.

After voters were exposed to Biden’s populist arguments, assessments of his economic record improved in the group’s polling, Clark said. But even after hearing that case, most voters in the group’s surveys still gave Biden negative marks for his economic performance, the study found.

That finding may suggest the limits on how much Biden’s prospective agenda can offset voters’ discontent over their actual economic experience during his presidency. To win in November, most strategists in both parties agree, Biden doesn’t need to completely erase Trump’s advantage on the economy because so many voters resist the former president on other grounds, such as democracy, abortion rights, and the general chaos and conflict that he ignites.

Still, Democrats would feel much better about the odds of those other concerns tipping the election in Biden’s favor if he can reduce his deficit on the economy to a more manageable level. To do that, Biden needs positive trends on the economy to persist – in particular, for wages to continue rising faster than prices, as they have since last spring.

But he also needs to persuade enough voters that his agenda will do more than Trump’s to help them make ends meet in the future – even if they mostly believe the opposite has so far been true of Biden’s time in the White House."

The victor in the race will preside over the expiration of many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, deciding whether to extend or expand the bill's many tax cuts, with Trump more likely to reduce taxes for high income earners.



A Biden victory would mean more student loan forgiveness, which Trump opposes. 'Junk Fees' and green energy tax credits would be among the other issues on which the candidates have opposing views.



As a presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump grows more and more likely, the two candidates are promising very different approaches to public policy when it comes to money.



After voters in 15 states went to the polls to vote in primary elections on Tuesday, Biden and Trump have moved closer to their respective parties’ nominations to run in the general election in November. The outcome of that race could have a big impact on the economy as well as household budgets. Here are some of the key issues to focus on.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

The incoming president will have to make some of those decisions pretty much immediately. Major portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—a Trump-era set of tax cuts—are set to expire at the end of 2025. For instance, the top marginal tax rate for high-income earners will rise to 39.6% from 37%. The standard deduction—the amount of your income that doesn’t count for your federal taxes—will be cut by about half. For an individual filer, it would revert to $6,500 and then be adjusted for inflation, down from $14,600 last tax season.



Biden has called for repealing the TCJA tax cuts for the wealthy to reduce the budget deficit, restoring the top marginal tax rate and imposing new taxes on billionaires and people who earn more than $1 million a year.



For his part, Trump has touted the economic benefits of his administration’s signature legislation and has promised “lower taxes” on his campaign website. A Trump victory, especially if Republicans win control of Congress, would increase the chances that the TCJA’s provisions for businesses and high earners would be extended.

Student Loan Forgiveness

Few groups of people will face more dramatically different policies under the two candidates than student loan borrowers. Biden has supported forgiveness of federal student loans, while Trump has fiercely opposed it.



Not only did Biden propose forgiving up to $20,000 for each borrower—an initiative that was struck down by the Supreme Court last summer—but he’s changed the rules for how existing student loan forgiveness programs work, resulting in $138 billion of debt for 3.9 million borrowers being canceled as of February.



Trump has taken the opposite approach. When the Supreme Court’s conservative majority blocked Biden’s forgiveness plan, Trump praised the ruling and said forgiveness was unfair to people who already paid off their loans.



When Trump was last president, the Department of Education opposed efforts by students to have their student debts discharged under “borrower defense” rules that allow people to seek to have their loans forgiven if they were misled by the schools they attended.

Biden’s Campaign Against 'Junk Fees'

The election will determine whether the Biden Administration’s war on what he calls “junk fees” will continue. Under Biden, regulators have restricted businesses from imposing fees on customers, especially on financial products. On Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) imposed an $8 limit on fees for late credit card payments, which currently average $32. The bureau has also proposed limiting banks from charging overdraft fees to customers who spend more money than the balances in their accounts.



Under Trump, the CFPB—the government’s consumer watchdog—took a much more business-friendly approach, rolling back Obama-era restrictions on payday lending and taking fewer actions against debt collectors.

Green Energy Tax Credits

Biden has signed laws promoting green energy, including a tax credit for buying an electric car worth up to $7,500. For his part, Trump has criticized electric vehicles and said he would put a stop to policies promoting them.



“Now, they want you to give you electric cars. Anybody want to drive for an hour then spend four hours to get a recharge?” Trump said at a speech in Columbus, Ohio last June. “First day in office, I’ll be ending all of that.""

The Big Economic Picture

All of these policies, and others, will have a big impact on the broader economy. In general, a Republican victory could bring lower taxes, especially on high earners and businesses, while a Democratic victory would likely bring higher taxes for those groups.



Republican governance on taxes would bring “somewhat faster economic growth, higher inflation, larger budget deficits, higher Treasury yields and a steeper yield curve, all else equal,” economists at Wells Fargo wrote in a research note.



Should the government remain divided between the two major parties, with each controlling at least one branch of government, the tax outcome would “modestly depress the 2026 outlook for growth, inflation, government borrowing and yields,” they predicted. A Democratic sweep—unlikely given the Senate seats up for contention—would result in tax policy that would set the economy somewhere in between the other two potential outcomes.



The election could affect the economy even before it happens. Economic research has shown that partisan conflict tends to increase during presidential election years, Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note. Historically, heightened partisan conflict—resulting in standoffs and gridlock in the legislature—has had a small but noticeable effect on economic growth, boosting it for a short time but decreasing it over the long run, Sweet wrote.



“The initial increase in monthly GDP around the shock from political conflict could be attributed to the idea that gridlock is good for stability in fiscal policy, but over time, it becomes corrosive for the economy–brinkmanship over 'must-pass' legislation unnerves consumers and businesses alike,” he wrote.

America’s economy appears to have gone woke and is now fully supporting the reelection of Crooked Joe Biden. I’m not sure how this happened, but no matter how much we say the economy is terrible, it keeps unpatriotically refusing to be terrible, posing a direct threat to PRESIDENT Donald J. Trump in the 2024 presidential race.

Just look at these recent headlines about the now-totally-liberal economy:

Along with all that, the S&P 500, which we now know has a liberal bias, hit a record high Jan. 19, wage growth is beating inflation and jobless claims hit their lowest point since 2022.

There must be fear!Good economic news forces the GOP to switch narrative to the border.

A booming Biden economy is bad for America and worse for Trump

None of this is good news if you care about President Trump or America. It’s clear Democrats are manipulating the economy and making it the strongest economy in the world in order to fool voters into thinking Biden is a competent president.

Don’t believe me? If you own stocks or have a 401(k), just look at your balance and you’ll see EXACTLY what these cheaters are up to. They’re trying to buy your votes by putting more money in your pockets. That’s cheating. DON’T BE FOOLED!

It’s clear true Trump supporters cannot be party to this kind of liberal skullduggery. So in response to this distressing spate of positive economic news, I hereby call on all MAGA faithful to remove themselves from the CORRUPTLY BOOMING BIDEN ECONOMY.

'Bidenomics' is working.It's too bad for Biden that Trump's message of doom is winning.

Cash out your 401(k) and invest in the Trump Train, baby!

If you have a 401(k), you need to immediately cash that out and either donate the money to President Trump’s reelection campaign/legal defense fund (he will give it back to you, with interest, once elected) or invest those funds in somethings sensible, like digital Trump Trading Cards.

Next, you must quit your job. It’s on us to help President Trump’s campaign by bringing those unemployment numbers back up to where we think they should be under an incompetent president who doesn’t know what day it is.

If you aren’t willing to quit your job, you must at least refuse any pay raise you’re offered. Only a squishy lib would allow himself to get paid more while a DEMONcrat is in office.

Trump's trading cards got us thinking:Is it sad? Desperate? Or a time to be selfless?

Trump wants you to believe America is a disaster – do as he says

Lastly, it is ABSOLUTELY imperative that you not feel confident about the future. America is a terrible place. It is falling apart. The economy is in shambles and your personal economic situation is a garbage fire.

Darkness is everywhere. Living is anguish. All hope is lost.

Only by embracing these America-first beliefs, and believing Trump is the one person who can fix everything and make life perfect, will you be able to declare yourself a true MAGA loyalist.

So get out there, fellow patriot, and disconnect from Biden’s economy. Sell stocks, put your retirement money in Trump’s coffers, embrace the gloom.

When it comes to Biden’s hot economy, remember this: Go broke or you're woke.

Good morning from Washington — at last — and welcome to US Election Countdown. I hope you had fun with Emily last week.

Joe Biden delivered a fiery State of the Union address on Thursday, as he hit concerns about his age and vitality head-on. And make no mistake: that was a campaign speech. Biden and his surrogates have now kicked off a post-SOTU tour of the country — and they have their work cut out for them, particularly on the economy.

Americans are feeling better about the economy, but they just won’t give Biden credit for it, according to a new FT-Michigan Ross poll [free to read]. Roughly 48 per cent of voters said they were now living “comfortably” or could “meet expenses with a little left over” in the first week of March, up from 43 per cent in November 2023, when the Financial Times first asked the question.

Almost a third of survey respondents said overall US economic conditions were “excellent” or “good” earlier this month, up from just over a fifth in November.

But Biden’s economic approval rating leaves a lot to be desired at 36 per cent, despite the US having the strongest growth and fastest falling inflation of any large advanced economy. Unemployment is hovering near record lows while the job market stays hot. And on Wall Street, the S&P 500 has hit record highs this year.

So what’s going on? Shouldn’t voters love all of this? The reality is that prices rose at a fast clip during Biden’s first term (for his part, the president said during his SOTU address that he “inherited an economy that was on the brink”). But now 45 per cent of voters think his economic policies have actually hurt the economy.

While costs are going up much more slowly now, 80 per cent of voters said price increases were among their biggest source of financial stress. Forty per cent of survey respondents said they trusted Donald Trump’s handling of the economy compared with 34 per cent for Biden.

But there is some good news for Biden: a growing number of voters think large corporations are taking advantage of inflation to charge more, up to 63 per cent in March from 58 per cent in February and 54 per cent in November. He already said during the SOTU that corporations needed to pay more taxes so expect to hear him aim his sights at corporations more as he hits the campaign trail.

Campaign clips: the latest election headlines

Behind the scenes

Republican billionaire megadonors Elizabeth and Richard Uihlein, Midwestern shipping supplies magnates based in the battleground state of Wisconsin, are getting behind Trump’s re-election campaign after initially bankrolling Florida governor Ron DeSantis’s failed bid. This is great news for Trump, who needs as much cash as he can get as he tries to shrink Biden’s fundraising advantage.

“We back Trump,” Elizabeth Uihlein told the FT’s Alex Rogers [free to read]. She and her husband are the highest-profile megadonors to return to Trump. They each gave $1.5mn to DeSantis, and Elizabeth said she would give Trump a similar figure.

But she seemed exasperated by the state of money in politics. “These two guys are very well-defined. I don’t understand why everybody has to give all this money,” she said, referring to Trump and Biden. “Neither of them have to spend a penny. We all know who they are. It’s ridiculous.”

She also doesn’t love the former president’s rhetoric:

“Everybody likes Trump’s policies,” she said. “But we have almost 10,000 people that work for us and I would never talk to them the way Trump talks to people.”

Since the 2016 election cycle, the Uihleins have given more than $250mn to federal candidates and political groups. They’ve also waded into races closer to home.

Datapoints

In conjunction with his post-SOTU tour, Biden’s campaign has launched a $30mn advertising blitz in battleground states, as he taps into a $56mn cash pile that is much more robust than Trump’s $30.5mn on hand, according to campaign finance data.

Overall, his campaign and political action committees have poured $125.5mn into adverts across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, six states that will probably decide the 2024 election.

Biden has spent the most in Pennsylvania at $35.1mn, followed by $24.7mn in Michigan and $21.5mn in Arizona.

The new adverts are likely to focus on shoring up the party’s base, with the Biden campaign saying they will focus on “high-impact and non-traditional TV opportunities” including Black, Hispanic, comedy and sports outlets.

He has already spent tens of millions on adverts set to run in the autumn during the run-up to Election Day, including more than $115.5mn for spots from the week of October 1 to the week of November 5.

New York CNN —

There’s rarely a good time for prices to rise a lot. Good luck finding someone who will tell you they enjoy it when their hard-earned dollars can’t stretch as far.

But, if you’re President Joe Biden, now is a particularly bad time for inflation to reaccelerate. Just as he was starting to get better marks on the economy after months of negative feedback from voters, inflation soared to the highest level in six months, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued Wednesday.

Prices were up 3.5% for the year in March, a jump from February’s 3.1% annual inflation rate, the Consumer Price Index report showed.

Even though the economy’s been performing well by many metrics, Biden’s learning the hard way that good data — no matter how strong — does little to change how people feel about the economy. On the other hand, bad economic data, especially regarding inflation, almost certainly guarantees people aren’t going to be feeling better about the economy.

But people don’t need to parse through monthly inflation reports to know prices are up. Just look at any gas station sign or the heating bill for your home — if you can even afford one.

Significant progress over the past two years in getting inflation down from multi-decade highs has been of little help to struggling Americans. All that means is the rate of price increases has slowed but the actual prices we’re paying are still higher than they were in prior years.

Since Biden took office three years ago, prices are up 19%, according to CPI data. That hasn’t won him many fans. Even his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, criticized Biden for not doing enough on inflation and “talking too much about bridges” while egg and milk prices are rising, according to audio obtained by Politico.

Biden’s message to voters: I’m working on it

Biden was quick to respond with optimism in a statement Wednesday morning.

“We have more to do to lower costs for hardworking families,” he said. Then, like any politician would try to do, he highlighted two areas where prices are lower than they were a year ago: eggs and milk (though both are starting to rise again as bird flu spreads). Gas used to be his go-to, but after Wednesday’s report, he can no longer say prices are lower now than they were a year ago, as OPEC supply cuts and a switch to summer fuels sends prices marching toward $4 a gallon.

Biden on Wednesday highlighted his legislative achievements and executive actions that have curbed costs as part of his plan to get price increases back to tolerable pre-pandemic levels.

“My agenda is lowering costs for prescription drugs, health care, student debt, and hidden junk fees,” he said in the statement. Even though many life-saving drugs are vastly unaffordable to people who need them most, drug prices on the whole are only up 0.4% year-over-year. Health insurance costs, meanwhile, are down 15%.

But canceling more student debt, as popular as it may be with Gen Z voters in particular, could prove to be inflationary. And the whole junk fee battle sounds good on paper but is legally complicated. Corporations don’t love being told to get rid of easy revenue streams and have tried to fight Biden on it. Similarly, he said he’s “calling on corporations including grocery retailers to use record profits to reduce prices.” If only it was that easy.

A White House spokesperson told CNN Biden is “focused on lowering the costs that matter to hardworking families.” The spokesperson, like Biden, lambasted Republican lawmakers, saying they have “no plan to lower inflation.”

But to his credit, Biden acknowledged one of the main drivers of inflation: housing costs. The shelter index, a broader component of the inflation report that covers a majority of housing expenses, is up 5.7% year-over-year. That alone accounted for 60% of the overall annual rise in prices last month.

Part of the reason housing is more expensive is there’s a shortage. So Biden’s proposal to build and renovate more than 2 million could help. But it’s unlikely to happen before November."

CNN —

The central puzzle about this election campaign, that has pollsters and pundits opining, is the disconnect between the state of the economy and President Joe Biden’s approval ratings. A simple rule of thumb is that a president’s approval rating predicts the chances of reelection. It used to be that the public’s view of the president depended mostly on its view of the economy. But that relationship has gone haywire recently.

Look at the current state of the economy. America is in unusually good health. It has recovered better from the Covid-19 pandemic than any other major economy. For two years the unemployment rate has been under 4%, a streak the US hasn’t seen in more than five decades.

Inflation, which was worrying, has dropped sharply since mid-2022 and is now 3.2%. Wage growth for lower-income workers over the past few years has outpaced that of high-income workers.

The flood of good news also includes some unprecedented data. In a reversal of a decades-long trend, Black workers’ participation rate in the labor force is now higher than that of White workers. And yet, Biden’s third-year average approval rating was about 40%, the second lowest of modern presidents. It’s currently around 38%.

Part of the answer is probably the disconnect around people’s perception and feelings. While consumer sentiment is up dramatically from its all-time low in June 2022 and many people have positive views of their personal finances, they are still gloomy on the economy at large.

Explanations for this disconnect abound. Some say it’s a time lag, others that people are being swayed by social media, still others that residual feelings about inflation tends to trump all else. But I think that the real answer is that politics is no longer fundamentally driven by economics – that our political preferences are today shaped more by issues of culture, class and tribalism than by how much money we make.

That is one of the core theses of my new book, “Age of Revolutions,” which argues that we are living through a huge backlash after decades of rapid accelerations in technology and globalization. And this backlash is largely centered on cultural anxiety in a fast-changing world.

The disconnect between economics and politics has been growing for a while. As Nate Cohn of The New York Times has noted, ever since Barack Obama’s presidency, the rock-solid connection between the health of the economy and a president’s approval ratings has “almost gone.”

Former President Donald Trump presided over a very strong economy until Covid-19, and yet his approval ratings were extremely low, just like Biden’s. And during the 2020 election, something extraordinary happened: Democrats’ and Republicans’ views of the economy flipped massively in the months around Biden’s inauguration.

Democrats who had previously thought the economy was in terrible shape now thought it was booming, and Republicans did the opposite. A similar flip-flop occurred when Trump was elected in 2016. In other words, peoples’ political leanings shaped their views of the economy, not vice versa.

What then is shaping peoples’ political affiliations? I argue in the book that it is identity — which encompasses culture, class and tribalism. In the 20th century, political leanings were shaped by economics. Where you sat economically determined where you voted politically.

It made sense in a much poorer age when vast numbers of working-class voters were fundamentally motivated by moving up to secure a decent living. (America’s per capita GDP in 1950, adjusted for inflation, was around $15,000.) Most Western societies achieved that basic condition by the 1960s, and people began to express other “post-materialist” identities and values. (I am drawing on powerful survey research, done over decades, by the social scientist Ronald Inglehart.)

Many people believe that populism is fundamentally about rising inequality and a working class that has been left behind. But look at northern European countries like Sweden and Denmark. They spend lavishly on social safety nets and worker retraining programs and have relatively low inequality. And yet, populist parties — at least one with a direct lineage to fascism — have surged in these places to become major political players.

France has coddled and shielded its workers more than almost any other industrial nation and yet, were elections held today, the xenophobic National Rally would probably win.

All these countries have seen large tides of migrants over the last few decades. In 1970, most major Western European countries had under 6% of their population who were foreign-born. In 2020, most had more than 12%. In Austria, Germany, and Sweden, it was close to 20%. (For comparison, the US has seen those numbers rise from around 6% to 15% during the same period).

Immigration today remains the rocket fuel that propels populist parties. Immigration is, in a sense, the visible face of globalization. You cannot see or feel capital flows or trade liberalization. But you can look at these new entrants into your society, who look different, speak differently, and often worship different gods, and feel unnerved.

One counterexample helps make the point. A major industrialized country that has not had much right-wing populism and where the old ruling establishment continues to hold the reins of power largely unchallenged is Japan. It is surely relevant to note that Japan also takes very few immigrants.

Beyond immigration, one sees how other issues that divide people along lines of religion, culture and class feed the new politics. In his last book, Inglehart noted a startling fact about the United States. The US had always been an outlier among developed countries as a rich nation that remained deeply religious, closer to Nigeria than to Denmark on this cultural scale. In recent years, the single strongest drop in religiosity (among countries he studied) occurred in the United States.

America is rapidly secularizing, and this is causing extreme anxiety in large parts of the country, especially among non-urban, non-college educated people. The religious and cultural divide in America is layered underneath a class divide: urban vs rural, college-educated vs non-college educated. And economic differences are malleable; you can split the difference between someone who wants to spend $2 billion and another who wants to spend $4 billion. But how do you split the difference on issues of identity, religion and morality like abortion and gay rights?

BIDEN’S LNG EXPORT BAN

“Ignoring science and heeding the loudest in his political base, President Biden recently moved to ban exports of U.S. Liquefied Natural Gas, or ‘LNG’—and he did this over the best interests of the American people.

“Less than two weeks ago, the Biden administration announced that it would impose an indefinite ban on the issuance of LNG export permits to non-Free Trade Agreement countries while it conducts a review to consider the climate impacts of natural gas.

“The Biden administration did NOT issue an Executive Order or request Congress enact legislation, but instead issued this major policy shift through a FACT SHEET in a press release.

“The announcement indicates no end point or timeline for this 'indefinite pause.'

“We invited DOE to testify, but they declined to send anyone to this hearing. They left America—and the communities of Southwest Louisiana and Texas—with many unanswered questions and unrecognized concerns.

“I am thankful, however, we will get to hear from witnesses who can speak to the benefits of US LNG and how the ban on LNG exports will harm the American economy, our energy security, and our national security.”

BENEFITS OF UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY

“LNG exports strengthen energy security, create jobs, decrease energy prices here at home, and lower emissions globally.

“LNG exports could add between $50 to 73 billion to the US economy by 2023 and add up to 450,000 jobs by 2040.

“They can also create billions of dollars in revenues for federal, state, and local governments.

“In addition to undercutting our domestic energy industry, President Biden’s decision is a gift to Putin.

“Global demand for natural gas is expected to increase 46 percent by 2050, and our European and Asian allies, who want to do business with the United States, will now look to Qatar, Russia, and Iran to meet their growing energy needs.

“The Biden administration’s energy policy has been a handout to our adversaries.

“The happiest person when Biden took office was Vladimir Putin.

“He knew he could continue to exploit the stranglehold the well-funded radical climate lobby has on this administration.

“These radical environmentalists don’t seem to care about the economic and environmental benefits exporting US gas has—especially to countries desperate to escape poverty.

“Under current law, any person wishing to import or export US natural gas must first obtain approval from FERC to construct and operate an LNG facility. This requires applicants to complete an environmental and safety review.

“After FERC issues this certification, DOE conducts a 'public interest' review of the project. DOE is required to do this for all exports going to Non-Free Trade Agreement countries.

“DOE is required to grant the export application UNLESS it is found that the proposed exportation or importation of LNG is not in the public interest.

“Congress intended the 'public interest' requirement to consider economic factors when it originally enacted the Natural Gas Act.

“The Biden administration has weaponized this review, in order to pursue climate objectives. Ironically, Biden and environmental radicals are going to achieve the opposite because a ban of U.S. LNG exports will increase emissions.”

REPUBLICAN SOLUTION

“Republicans have a solution. My colleague Congressman Pfluger recently introduced HR 7176, the Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act—formerly led by Rep. Johnson.

“This bill would lift all DOE restrictions on the import and export of natural gas. Export facilities would still have to receive certification from FERC, but DOE would no longer be able to halt exports based on this administration’s weaponized 'public interest' test.

“DOE has consistently found that U.S. LNG exports serve the 'public interest' because they contribute positive economic benefits and strengthen energy security for the American people. These exports also have the potential to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

“Mr. Pfluger’s bill is the solution to pushing back on yet another awful Biden energy policy, and I urge all my colleagues to support this effort.”"

Gallup reported that just 27% of Americans said they were ""very"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with how much people in the U.S. pay in federal taxes. That marked a 9 percentage-point drop from three years ago.

Only a slightly larger proportion of Americans — 29% — expressed some degree of satisfaction with the distribution of income and wealth in the country, according to the poll. Meanwhile, 36% reported feeling happy about the state of the U.S. economy.

For both wealth distribution and the economy, there was a 7 percentage-point decline in satisfaction compared to where it was in 2021, Gallup said.

SMALL BUSINESS OWNER POURS HEART OUT OVER BIDEN'S CRIPPLING ECONOMY: ‘WE CAN’T TAKE ANOTHER 4 YEARS'

Gallup released those findings on Thursday as part of a larger report on a survey that polled more than 1,000 U.S. adults by phone from Jan. 2-22 about a range of 31 total issues.

Earlier in the month, Biden had highlighted certain aspects of America’s economy.

""Our economy has created 14.8 million jobs since I took office. Unemployment has been under 4% for two full years now. And inflation has been at the pre-pandemic level of 2% over the last half year,"" Biden said in a Feb. 2 post on X. ""Our policies are working.""

""Wealth, wages, and employment are higher now than before the pandemic, and I won’t stop fighting to keep our progress going,"" the president also said.

Government agencies have been putting out their latest economic data in recent weeks.

Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, went up 0.3% month over month and 3.1% year over year in January, according to the latest data released Feb. 13 by the Labor Department.

In late January, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. gross domestic product had shown 3.3% growth on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter.

Much like a Mentos mint popped into a Coke bottle, the pressure is bubbling and potentially set to burst.

But the prime fear among doomsday preppers is less out-of-this-world, like an alien invasion or zombie apocalypse; rather, it takes place on Wall Street’s doorstep.

A third (33%) of Americans fear the end of the U.S. will be the result of a total economic collapse that ripples across the nation, according to a poll released by Ipsos’ Consumer Tracker. Other apocalyptic anxieties revolve around World War III (25%), climate change (19%), another pandemic (12%), and killer robots (2%). A portion of respondents (6%) say none of the above are on their mind when they fear the end.

With an election on the horizon, the nation’s feelings toward finances could be a thorn in President Biden’s side as he seeks to hold onto his job for another four years. America, a relatively young nation, is an especially odd spot as it goes through growing pains—or the end of an era, depending on who you ask.

As polarization increases especially in a radicalized right, satisfaction with the nation’s democracy is reaching a record low. Fittingly, the different parties foresee different chaos scenarios. While on average a third of Americans are focused on economic turmoil, Republicans are more concerned than Democrats at 48% and 22%, respectively. Independents stand at 37%. Democrats are most concerned about climate change at 32%. That shifts to just 6% for Republicans and 12% for independents. While it has become a partisan issue, the earth is in crisis mode as the U.N. climate chief warns that we have two years to really mobilize before climate change worsens.

After years of inflation that outpaced wages, Americans are finally catching a break, but many are still feeling a residual sting. Cynicism pervades as many deal with oversize student loans, grapple with financial instability, and face an uphill battle to afford incredibly pricey life milestones like buying a house, having kids, or retiring. Despite relative gains—especially in the working-class fields as bolstered by union success—the true middle class has wavered in an age of high inequality.

“The economy’s performance and any economic disasters loom large in the public’s mind. Whether Americans notice and benefit from an improving economy will be an important piece to Biden’s success over the next seven months,” Sarah Feldman, senior data journalist, tells Fortune. “But, for right now, the president’s marks on the economy are weak, and he needs inflationary pressure to ease to get on better footing with the public here.”

Of course, the data shows that the U.S. economy is stronger than it may feel to many Americans, as economists often note. But people are still feeling down, reeling from a pandemic and continually looming recessions, so the Biden administration will absorb much of the blame. In general, the political party in power tends to take a hit during times of economic malaise. (That said, a new paper from left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute says economic performance tends to be stronger when Democrats are in power.)

Second on everyone’s list of potential disasters is another worldwide war, at 25% total and almost equal concern across all parities. Indeed, Americans are constantly hearing about socioeconomic turmoil, war, and genocide. It’s another point of contention for the election, as Biden’s inaction on Israel has disenchanted some of his past voters (especially younger ones).

One thing is for sure: America’s plate is full when it comes to all its burgeoning crises and brewing anxieties. And the next senior citizen to take the reins of the troubled nation will have to deal with how much people pay for groceries before we tackle the less-apparent problems like killer robots."

The facts are on his side, but many voters don’t feel them. To change that, he’s got to tell voters every day until Election Day exactly what he’s doing to tackle one of their biggest concerns: high prices.

People often credit themselves for getting a raise, but blame the government, and especially the president, when life costs more.

Thirty-one percent of voters say the economy has improved, a 10-point increase in just a few months. The president, however, is not reaping the rewards.

Despite good, empirical data about the economy, people experience higher prices every day, everywhere they go, from restaurants to grocery stores. It’s what sticks in people’s minds. And while wages have gone up, from a behavioral economic standpoint, people often credit themselves for getting a raise, but blame the government, and especially the president, when life costs more.

That’s the predicament Biden finds himself in going into the election. Which makes the message around the economy crucially important.

Let’s start with the truth, even if it’s not universally acknowledged: A year ago, there was near total agreement a recession was coming.

Instead, the economy grew 2.5% in 2023.

Unemployment was expected to rise, especially as the Federal Reserve sharply hiked interest rates to slow inflation (and the economy). Instead, unemployment has hovered below 4% for nearly two years, something not seen since the 1960s. Today, it’s 3.7%. At the same time, employers are hiring at a furious pace. Last year, nearly 3 million jobs were created — maybe that has something to do with the 5.5 million new businesses started last year.

Consumers are feeling better about the economy. A recent survey found they’re feeling more confident about both the economy and that inflation will keep slowing. CEOs are more optimistic, too. Business Roundtable’s latest poll found their outlook for the economy jumped double digits and is now above the historical average. They plan to invest more in facilities and hire more.

Let’s not forget the stock market, which is setting new records on a regular basis. The average 401(k) is up 14% from a year ago and is now $118,600. The stock market is not the economy, but for many Americans, it serves as a daily temperature check for how things are going. While not everyone owns stocks, 58% of households do — the largest share on record.

Then there are all the bipartisan bills to promote economic growth today and for years to come: the American Rescue Plan Act, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.

But let’s be honest, all this is not sinking in with voters. Poll after poll finds them generally unhappy about how Biden is handling the economy and uncertain about where it’s headed, especially because of inflation.

The good news is that prices are rising more slowly, but that’s coming off years of supercharged inflation, especially for groceries, which are up 25% since January 2020. Shoppers know this every time they walk into a supermarket — they see it and it’s maddening. People feel there’s nothing they can do, and it’s not like they can skip milk, eggs and bread. Today, Americans spend over 11% of their income on food, the highest amount in 30 years.

Biden can’t fix high food prices, but he can point to what his administration is already doing to help Americans save money. For just a few examples:

Increasing the amount of food assistance for low-income families.

Moving to block the merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 supermarkets, which could limit competition and choice.

Capping insulin at $35 per month, and next year capping Medicare prescription costs at $2,000 a year.

Canceling $138 billion in student debt.

In reality, until recently, consumers have kept paying even as prices rose. But once consumers decide that meal or that flight simply costs too much and businesses see demand suffer, there might be a change. The problem is that everyday items cost more. For economically vulnerable families, that can be crushing. For wealthier Americans, it’s annoying and cause for discontent.

There’s a lot that is going right in the economy. It should be universally agreed on: It’s not a bad economy. Voters, however, are not economists and facts alone won’t convince them. Americans need to feel their financial lives are improving, and it’s on the president and his administration to show how they’re making that happen. And when Biden steps up to the podium Thursday evening, he has a chance to do just that."

President Joe Biden is preparing a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania next week, zeroing in on his plans to raise taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations as he looks to present an economic contrast in his close contest against former President Donald Trump.

The push will kick off Tuesday with a major address in Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, campaign officials told CNN, a site he’s often turned to as the backdrop for making his economic populist pitch to voters.

“The address will drive home a simple question: Do you think the tax code should work for rich people or for the middle class?” a campaign official told CNN. “The president has made it clear what he thinks the answer is, and so has Donald Trump.”

The president then will travel to the Pittsburgh area on Wednesday and speak at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday, officials said. The campaign also plans to hold events in other battleground states next week to push the economic case against Trump, who will be required to be in a New York City courtroom for jury selection at his hush money trial.

Biden’s campaign swing, the first since his March barnstorm of battleground states that will effectively serve as counterprogramming to Trump’s trial, comes as both men are trying to win over working-class voters. By focusing on taxes, the president also is attempting to break through on economic issues at a time when voters have maintained pessimistic views of their personal financial state and his handling of the economy, which has proven to be a vexing political issue in his reelection bid.

Biden will deliver his Scranton speech one day after Tax Day and less than two weeks after Trump told wealthy donors that extending the sweeping tax cuts congressional Republicans enacted in 2017 would be a key priority if he’s elected to a second term. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced taxes for most Americans, the rich benefited far more than others.

The Biden campaign seized on Trump’s comments – spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said the former president is “promising tax giveaways to billionaire donors.”

The individual tax provisions in the 2017 law are set to expire at the end of the year. If they are extended, more than 60% of the benefits would go to those in the top 20% of income, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group. More than 40% of the benefits would go to those in the top 5%.

If Trump achieves his goal, those making between $400,000 and $1 million would get an average tax cut of about $15,000, lifting their after-tax incomes by 3.1%, according to the center’s estimates. Those who earn $1 million or more would enjoy an average tax cut of about $50,000, raising their after-tax incomes by 2.3%.

In his State of the Union address last month, Biden outlined proposals to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and corporations while pledging those earning less than $400,000 would not have their taxes increase.

“Look, I’m a capitalist. If you want to make or can make a million or millions of bucks, that’s great. Just pay your fair share in taxes,” Biden said. “A fair tax code is how we invest in things that make this country great: health care, education, defense and so much more.”

Biden’s budget has called for a 25% minimum tax on all income – including unrealized gains on assets, which are not currently taxed – for the wealthiest .01% of Americans, impacting those with a net worth of more than $100 million. He’s also called for increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% up from the 21% set by the 2017 tax cuts.

Tackling the economy

Biden has sought to highlight efforts to bring down costs on everything from prescription drugs to junk fees. His team has emphasized what they see as bright spots in the economy, including low unemployment, wage gains and an overall downward trend in inflation from its highest point earlier in the administration.

But concerns about stubborn inflation came back into the spotlight this week as the Consumer Price Index showed consumer prices picked up again last month, marking a 3.5% increase for the 12 months ending in March. Another key inflation gauge showed producer prices rose 2.1% in March, lower than expected but increasing at the highest rate since April 2023. A key consumer sentiment survey is expected to be released on Friday.

In the wake of these reports, Biden has acknowledged there’s “more to do” to drive down costs and argued corporations with high profits should lower prices for consumers. The president defended his handling of inflation on Wednesday.

“We have a plan to deal with it whereas the opposition – my opposition – talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people. And so, I think they have no plan. Our plan is one, I think, is so sustainable,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden.

A recent AP-NORC poll found 37% of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the economy. According to a CNN poll from earlier this year, a 55% majority of Americans overall say they feel Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, while just 26% believe his policies have improved conditions. Another 19% say they’ve had no effect – numbers that are nearly unchanged from the summer.

Battle for Pennsylvania

Biden will deliver his remarks in a battleground state that could decide whether he wins a second term. The president and his predecessor are both making appeals to working class voters, particularly in industrial states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called “blue wall” that Biden is looking to keep intact.

Biden has traveled to Pennsylvania four times this year with two stops in the Philadelphia area, one outside of Pittsburgh and another in Allentown. This will mark the first time Biden has traveled to Scranton this year.

Trump is set to hold a rally in Schnecksville near Allentown on Saturday.

The president has often used his hometown to promote his blue-collar upbringing, portraying himself as an advocate for working-class Americans while arguing Trump is on the side of the wealthy.

“I view this campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue,” Biden said at a CNN townhall in Scranton in 2020. “All Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. All he thinks about is the stock market.”

A recent Wall Street Journal poll of registered voters in Pennsylvania found no clear leader in a two-way race with Trump at 47% and Biden at 44%, within the margin of error. The WSJ survey found registered voters across seven battleground states believe Trump would handle the economy better than Biden, with Trump coming in at 54% and Biden at 34%."

This article appears in the February 2024 issue, with the headline “Bad Dreams.”

President Biden consistently polls horribly on the economy, giving Donald Trump an enormous edge on this key issue. More than half the public thinks unemployment is at a record high and the economy is in a recession.

These negative views are disturbing, since if people continue to believe that Trump is a better economic steward, it will be hard for Biden to win the election. But they’re extra alarming because they’re 180 degrees at odds with reality.

It’s worth highlighting some key facts about the economy under Biden. First, the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent. It has been under 4 percent for 24 consecutive months, a streak that has not been matched in more than half a century.

Unemployment is an issue not only for the roughly 6 million people who are currently unemployed, but also for the more than 5 million people who lose or leave their jobs every single month, with most subsequently joining the pool of people looking for new jobs. That means tens of millions of people (plus their immediate family members) have direct experience with the labor market over the course of the year—making those who care about the state of that market hardly a small minority.

Because of the strong labor market under Biden, tens of millions of workers have left bad jobs to take better ones. This is a great story: Workplace satisfaction hit a record high in the recovery.

The strong job market has also meant rising real wages. For all the complaints about high prices, wages have risen more rapidly and are now higher when adjusted for inflation than before the pandemic. Even better, the most rapid pay increases have been for those at the bottom end of the wage distribution spectrum. Much of the rise in inequality of the past four decades has been reversed in the past three years. And the Black/white wage differential has fallen to its lowest level on record.

Meanwhile, inflation is roughly back to its pre-pandemic rate. While most prices will not return to where they were before the pandemic, the prices of many items, like rents and used cars, are falling.

When Nippon Steel in December offered to buy the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker for $14.9 billion, investors cheered. But there was vocal opposition from the United Steelworkers union, which complained it had not been consulted, and prominent lawmakers in both parties, who objected to a foreign buyer swallowing a venerable American company. The loss of independence, they said, could threaten national security by leaving the United States short of steel in a crisis.

“I’m flat-out opposed to it,” Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) said in an interview. “And it’s not just this transaction I’m worried about. The precedent really matters.”

The deal also raises uncomfortable questions for the Biden administration, little more than nine months before the November election. The president, who often emphasizes the value of U.S. alliances, welcomes foreign investment. But permitting the purchase by Nippon Steel risks crossing organized labor, whose support he needs in vital swing states such as Pennsylvania.

The steel drama highlights tensions in the international economic policy that national security adviser Jake Sullivan unveiled last year. Biden’s trade and industrial policies — which some analysts describe as a form of economic nationalism — are designed to promote domestic production and to attract foreign cash to the United States.

In August, the White House hailed an uptick in foreign funding of new U.S. factories, which has nearly doubled from its pre-pandemic average. But now that Nippon Steel wants to invest here, the government is eyeing potential security concerns.

“It gets at some of the incoherence of the economic nationalist project,” said Scott Lincicome, a trade specialist at the Cato Institute.

Generous infrastructure spending, plus subsidies for semiconductor and clean-energy projects, will spur an estimated $3.5 trillion in combined public and private investment over the next decade, the administration says.

“We believe that our country — and our world — are safer, more resilient, and more prosperous because of the investment of foreign-owned companies in the United States,” the president said in a statement a few months after taking office.

Steel has long been one of the most protected U.S. markets. In 2018, President Donald Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on all imported steel. Biden later negotiated a deal with the European Union to replace tariffs on its products with quotas. In December, he extended the deal until 2025.

But the barriers to imported steel effectively incentivize foreign companies to invest in domestic production, as Japanese automakers did in the early 1980s.

David Burritt, chief executive of U.S. Steel, said last fall that the company was benefiting from a trend of “accelerating de-globalization,” as nations reassessed the risks of interdependence. “The United States is experiencing a once-in-a-generation onshoring boom,” he told investors in October.

Trump, who appears likely to be the Republican nominee for president, has not commented publicly on Nippon Steel’s bid. But some of his allies want it killed.

“This is bulls--t. It can’t happen,” said Stephen K. Bannon of the “War Room” podcast, who was Trump’s chief White House strategist.

Some of the angst surrounding the Nippon Steel bid draws on memories of an age of American industrial might.

U.S. Steel is an iconic name with a storied corporate lineage. But it has been a long time since it was a genuinely iconic company.

It was established in 1901 through a merger of steel companies led by titans of American capitalism: John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and Charles M. Schwab.

U.S. Steel was the nation’s first billion-dollar corporation. The molten metal that emerged from its blast furnaces was molded into the tanks, planes and aircraft carriers that won World War II, as well as the automobiles and appliances that Americans bought in the postwar boom.

The company’s more recent history is less impressive. Now the third-largest steelmaker in the nation by revenue, trailing Cleveland-Cliffs and Nucor, U.S. Steel employs 22,740 workers, less than half as many as 20 years ago. The company lost money in nine of the last 15 years. Its annual output ranks 27th in the world, according to the World Steel Association. Nippon Steel’s ranks fourth.

The debate over Nippon Steel’s plan to acquire U.S. Steel echoes the 1980s, when Japanese companies snapped up American totems such as Rockefeller Center, the Pebble Beach golf course and Universal Studios. At the time, many Americans regarded the asset sales as a symptom of economic decline. Years later, it became clear that many of the Japanese buyers had overpaid for their American trophies.

For now, Biden can avoid choosing between political and economic imperatives. In announcing the deal last month, the companies said they would submit it to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency body chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, which scrutinizes foreign deals for potential national security impacts.

That has not yet happened, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Executives plan to submit the paperwork to CFIUS by the end of the week, the person added. The panel deliberates behind closed doors and is expected to release its recommendation in months, though the process often slows.

Lael Brainard, the president’s national economic adviser, said last week at the Brookings Institution that the transaction deserved “serious scrutiny.” Robust domestic steel production is needed for the transition to a greener economy, the revitalization of domestic manufacturing and the development of more-resilient supply chains, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Whether the sale of the nation’s third-largest steel producer to a Japanese buyer imperils any of those goals remains to be determined.

“I’m not confident they’ll get past it,” said William Reinsch, a Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration. “It’s a political issue. This is an administration that looks at these things from a political perspective.”

The political considerations are obvious. The steelworkers union endorsed Biden in 2020 and has more than 1 million members, including tens of thousands in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.

David McCall, the union’s president, questioned Nippon Steel’s commitment to the union’s existing collective bargaining agreement.

“There’s no way it could work for us,” he said of the purchase, adding that he “does not object to the nationality of the owners. That doesn’t bother me.”

Opponents of the deal include Vance’s fellow Republican senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as both of Pennsylvania’s Democratic senators, Bob Casey and John Fetterman, and Democratic senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

A Japanese-owned U.S. Steel would be “less responsive to U.S. national security needs,” Vance said. He also objects to allowing Nippon Steel to skirt U.S. tariffs on imported steel through the purchase and called for a blanket ban on any foreign purchaser of a U.S. company that benefits from such trade barriers.

“If they want access to U.S. markets and U.S. workers, they really have to ‘greenfield’ the investment here,” he said.

Critics’ national security objections seem exaggerated. The U.S. military each year needs just 3 percent of total domestic steel production, according to the Pentagon. Compared with decades ago, modern combat systems use less steel and more of other materials, such as titanium, aluminum and composites, according to Josh Spoores, steel industry analyst for CRU Group in Pittsburgh.

The Defense Department does not buy anything directly from U.S. Steel. The company said some customers that have both defense and commercial businesses might use its raw steel in military hardware.

“U.S. Steel’s manufacturing technologies and processes are not designed specifically for the production of steel with military applications, nor does U.S. Steel have any products, capability, or know-how that is specific to any U.S. government applications, including U.S. military applications,” the company said.

In 2022, Biden issued an executive order requiring CFIUS to take into account a transaction’s impact upon the resilience of U.S. supply chains — a concern that mushroomed after the pandemic and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.

In recent years, CFIUS reviews of deals involving Chinese buyers have become especially controversial. But Japan is a U.S. treaty ally; if the country were attacked, the United States would be obligated to defend it. Nippon Steel already holds stakes in eight U.S. steel companies, which employ about 4,000 Americans.

“From a purely legal, national security perspective, it’s a deal that should get through,” said John Ingrassia, a partner at Proskauer, a New York-based law firm. “I see no reason it shouldn’t get resolved before the election.”

The Treasury-led committee will conduct its deliberations after receiving a classified assessment from the U.S. intelligence community. If the committee identifies specific concerns, it can draft a “mitigation agreement” requiring the buyer to take specific actions.

Nippon Steel executives have met with several lawmakers in an effort to ease their concerns. In those meetings, the executives promised that U.S. Steel will remain in Pittsburgh operating under its existing name, and that they are committed to the steelworkers’ collective bargaining agreement. No layoffs of salaried or union workers are in the offing, according to the person familiar with the situation.

The Japanese steelmaker, which operates 11 blast furnaces, expects to improve the efficiency of U.S. Steel’s furnaces while also reducing their carbon footprint, the person said."
494,Opinion | Americans are happier about the economy. Why are they crediting Trump? - The Washington Post,Opinion | Americans are happier about the economy. Why are they crediting Trump?  The Washington Post,"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzAzLzA1L2JpZGVuLXRydW1wLXBvbGxzLWVjb25vbXktaW5mbGF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"The good news for President Biden: Americans are finally starting to appreciate the strength of the U.S. economy. The bad news: Somehow this seems to be helping Donald Trump. The U.S. economy has defied recession forecasts and continued chugging along during Biden’s term. Actually, scratch that. It’s been rocketing along for more than a year, with near-record low unemployment, rapid gross domestic product growth and fading inflation. On some metrics, it’s doing even better than pre-pandemic forecasts had anticipated.

Through most of this period, though, Americans have been incongruously grumpy. At times, they’ve rated the economy about as poorly as they did during stretches of the Great Recession, when nearly every metric was much worse.

In recent months, public perceptions of the economy seemed to be catching up to how good the economy looks on paper. Sure, views of the economy might not be rosy just yet, but they’re definitely rosier. For instance, a Wall Street Journal poll released over the weekend found that 31 percent of voters said the economy had gotten better over the past two years, which is 10 percentage points higher than was the case in December. Other surveys released in the past week, including those from CBS News, YouGov and the New York Times-Siena College, similarly show improvements in perceptions of economic conditions and of respondents’ own finances.

If this trend persists, it could strengthen Biden’s reelection chances. Barack Obama benefited from a similar turnaround when he ran for a second term in 2012. But that transference of goodwill hasn’t happened this cycle, at least not yet. The percentage of survey respondents approving of Biden’s overall job performance has been frozen in the high 30s for months.

Follow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions Follow

The share of voters who approve of Biden’s handling of the economy has also shown little improvement.

Perhaps most distressing for Democrats, when survey respondents are asked to rate Biden against the likely GOP presidential nominee, Biden fares poorly.

They remember the economy under Trump as being much better than the economy is today, CBS polling found. The last year of Trump’s presidency, when unemployment reached its highest level since the Great Depression, apparently doesn’t count, or has been forgotten.

Voters are also more than twice as likely to say that Trump’s policies helped them personally as they are about Biden’s work, the New York Times-Siena poll found.

And when asked whether a second term from either candidate would lead prices to go up or down, voters are more than twice as likely to believe Trump would push prices down as they are for Biden, per the CBS poll.

This is astounding. Leaving aside the faulty premise of that question — the overall price level almost never goes down; it merely rises more slowly — Trump’s policy agenda would likely worsen inflation. Why? Consider his main economic proposals:

Whatever you think of Biden’s record on inflation — and I have some grumbles, mostly related to Biden’s refusal to reverse his predecessor’s policies — each of Trump’s proposed measures would make inflation worse on the margin.

Don’t take my word for it. Analysts at Evercore ISI, an investment banking firm, recently analyzed the first three items above and forecast that another Trump term (relative to another Biden term) would likely require higher interest rates to counteract inflationary pressures. Likewise, Goldman Sachs Economic Research recently wrote a note to clients warning that the potential politicization of the Fed under another Trump administration would raise inflation risks.

Trump has claimed that economic and financial improvements thus far (including record-high stock markets under Biden) are because of his influence, or at least anticipation of his return. This is ludicrous, yet a large portion of the public seems receptive to this message — amnesiac about how he ended his presidency and blissfully unaware of what he’d do if granted another term."

Katie Britt of Alabama delivered the Republican response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Thursday night, and laid blame on Biden for a host of national and international crises — what she said is chaos at the border, in cities, in the economy and among U.S. allies.

Britt stuck mostly to familiar GOP talking points. She panned Biden’s handling of immigration, the economy, crime and foreign policy, while questioning if the 81-year-old is up to the challenge of leading the country.

But the Alabamian delivered some critiques in a more congenial Southern manner than many other national Republicans are prone to use.

“The American people are scraping by while the President proudly proclaims Bidenomics is working,” she said. “Goodness, y’all. Bless his heart. We know better.”

Seated at a kitchen table, Britt said her most important job was as “a wife and mother to two school-aged children,” and framed much of her criticism as anxiety about her children’s generation.

Biden has overseen an eroding American dream, Britt said, delivering in gentler language a central campaign theme for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

“The country we know and love seems to be slipping away,” she said. “It feels like the next generation will have fewer opportunities — and less freedom — than we did. I worry my own children may not even get a shot at living their American dreams.”

The country can “do better,” Britt said.

Coming eight months before a presidential election, the State of the Union and Britt’s response were marked by heavy doses of campaign rhetoric, and Britt asked voters to reject Biden at the ballot box.

“There is no doubt we’re at a crossroads. We all feel it,” she said.

“But here’s the good news: We the people are still in the driver’s seat. We get to decide whether our future will grow brighter, or whether we settle for an America in decline. Well, I know which choice our children deserve — and the choice the Republican Party is fighting for.”

Immigration, foreign policy

As Trump and other Republicans have for the past year, Britt made a surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border a central criticism of the president.

Biden came into office with “the most secure border of all time,” but squandered it with a host of executive orders meant to soften the approach to immigration Trump, his predecessor, oversaw, Britt said.

Britt said fentanyl and coming across the border and “senseless murders” were responsible for “empty chairs at kitchen tables just like this one.”

Britt cited Laken Riley, a nursing student in Georgia killed by a Venezuelan immigrant with a previous conviction for shoplifting.

Biden mentioned Riley during his address, which still didn’t satisfy Republican critics who urged him to “say her name.”

“Tonight, President Biden finally said her name,” Britt said. “But he refused to take responsibility for his own actions. Mr. President, enough is enough.”

Biden also squandered U.S. geopolitical advantages, Britt said, first with a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and then by entertaining a new deal to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons.

“We’ve become a nation in retreat,” she said. “And the enemies of freedom see an opportunity.”

She described an unsafe world stage, highlighting U.S. casualties in the Middle East since war between Israel and the militant group Hamas began in October. She referenced the deaths of three U.S. soldiers in Jordan and two Navy seals off the coast of Somalia in January.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine also showed world affairs were dangerous, Britt said.

But she did not address Biden’s call roughly an hour earlier for Congress to approve funding for Ukraine. Republicans in Congress have stymied the administration’s request for additional aid to help Ukraine fight Russia’s invasion.

IVF, economy and crime

Britt said Republicans support nationwide access to in vitro fertilization, a common fertility treatment that has been in the national spotlight for more than a week after the Alabama Supreme Court issued a decision holding that excess embryos routinely created during IVF had the same legal rights as children.

“We strongly support continued nationwide access to in vitro fertilization,” Britt said. “We want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world.”

While the president pointed to dropping unemployment, flattening inflation and rising wages, Britt said Biden’s message was divorced from the reality for families still “struggling to make ends meet” with the high costs of necessities such as housing and childcare.

Britt also played on voters fears’ of crime, blaming a perceived rise in violence on a liberal political ideology that accepts criminality and opposes police funding.

“For years, the left has coddled criminals and defunded the police – all while letting repeat offenders walk free. The result is tragic but foreseeable—from our small towns to America’s most iconic city streets, life is getting more and more dangerous.”

The actual crime statistics painted a less clear picture. While the interview-based annual criminal victimization survey conducted by the federal Bureau of Justice indicated an increase in violent crime from 2021 to 2022, FBI crime statistics compiled from local police reports across the country showed a drop in the national violent crime rate and the murder rate.

Unifying all of Britt’s criticisms of Biden’s policy choices was the idea that Biden was a weak leader, perhaps hobbled by age.

“Right now, our Commander in Chief is not in command,” she said. “The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader.”

Launching pad?

The State of the Union response, delivered by a member of the opposing party to the president, is seen as a plum assignment for young politicians with ambitions beyond their current office.

Florida Republican Marco Rubio delivered a response in 2013, two years before he’d run for president.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s response to Donald Trump in 2020 raised her national profile enough that Biden reportedly vetted her as a running mate that year.

And South Carolina’s Tim Scott gave the response to Biden in 2021, two years before announcing his White House run.

Britt’s response was likely the largest audience she’s addressed since succeeding longtime Sen. Richard Shelby in 2023. Britt, 42, worked for Shelby for five years, including two as the powerful appropriator’s chief of staff."

And that endangers President Biden’s reelection prospects. Economists are unsure why inflation has persisted. Some of it is a persistent hangover from the pandemic. But some of it could well be that a feature of recent economic policy — of both the Trump and Biden administrations — has been to ask consumers to pay more for goods and services.

Both administrations goosed the economy with large pandemic relief packages, which without question added to inflationary pressures. But beyond those bills, which have by now probably worked their way through the system, there is another possible cause. Donald Trump had few tangible achievements in office. But he can credibly point to breaking with decades of bipartisan economic policy — on tariffs. Trump raised tariffs on China as well as on many of the United States’ closest allies in the West.

While candidate Biden criticized those tariffs, President Biden has kept most in place. In addition, the Biden administration has imposed tight “Buy America” provisions in large spending bills such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the infrastructure act. All of these policies ask Americans to pay more to achieve certain political goals — less dependence on China, greater resilience, subsidizing green energy, boosting domestic manufacturing. Even the Inflation Reduction Act, as three economists have convincingly shown, is about five times more expensive as a way to cut carbon emissions compared to a carbon tax. All of the political goals Biden is promoting might well be worthwhile, but they do come at a cost. And one wonders if the cost will be permanently higher inflation.

The tariffs are the most egregious of all these policies. Despite Trump’s rhetoric to the contrary, they are a tax on American consumers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimates that so far Americans have paid more than $230 billion in these taxes. In addition, tens of billions of dollars have been handed out to farmers to compensate for their losses in agricultural exports (as a consequence of China’s retaliatory tariffs).

It’s hard to find anyone who believes that tariffs have been effective. They have not altered China’s policies one iota and have cost the American economy in money and lost jobs. According to the Tax Foundation, each year the tariffs cost the U.S. economy nearly 200,000 jobs and 0.25 percent of its gross domestic product, or roughly $70 billion in annual output. Or, to put it another way, enacting a modest set of trade liberalization policies proposed by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in 2022 would reduce inflation by about 1.3 percentage points, which works out to almost $800 of savings per American household.

Follow this author Fareed Zakaria 's opinions Follow

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative promised to review the tariffs to determine whether they have been effective. It has been working on this review for about two years with no end in sight — despite apparently having little on its agenda these days (since it has abandoned its core business of promoting trade). A senior administration official confessed to me that the reason is that if USTR admits the tariffs have failed, it will also have to recommend that they be lifted — which the Biden team does not want to do.

There is also a foreign policy cost to the rising protectionism in America. Biden met with his Japanese counterpart this week in a bid to strengthen the alliance between the United States and one of its closest allies. And yet his administration has announced its staunch opposition to a Japanese company buying U.S. Steel — a company that has been foundering for years and is a shadow of the behemoth it once was. Nippon Steel, the Japanese company, promises to invest in U.S. Steel, honor its labor contracts and retain all its workers into 2026. In short, it would rescue an underperforming American company. But the optics seem more important than the substance to the Biden administration.

The conventional wisdom of the past several years has been that America hollowed out its manufacturing base by embracing globalization and efficiency, which in turn led to the rise of right-wing populism. But that argument doesn’t stand scrutiny because countries like Germany and France, which protected workers and invested massively in retraining, have also seen right-wing populism boom. Declines in manufacturing are part of the economic rise of countries — notice that even China, which has prized its factories above all else, has seen manufacturing decline as a share of its economy, from 32 percent in 2011 to 28 percent in 2022."
